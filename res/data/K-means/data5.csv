By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last April, we first reported on Russia’s plan to send the world’s largest submarine, the Typhoon class Dmitry Donskoy , and the Russian Navy’s largest surface combatant, the Kirov class nuclear powered battlecruiser Piotr Velikiy , into the Baltic Sea. After leaving port just four days ago, the two vessels have now made their way through the Danish Straits and into that increasingly tense body of water. The two iconic vessels, both relics of the highpoint of Soviet engineering, have been accompanied by the seagoing tug boat Nikolai Chiker throughout their journey—another reminder that Russia’s largest naval ships are not necessarily known for their reliability. This is especially an issue when those ships are moving through tight waterways controlled by wary neighbors, and the world is watching. Here are some awesome top-down photos from the Danish defense forces of Dmitry Donskoy and Piotr Velikiy as they enter the Baltic Sea (click the tweet to enlarge each shot), as well as a photo of Dmitry Donskoy passing under Great Belt bridge. Both vessels had to take this route because their deep drafts: The Donskoy has made its entire transit from its berth near the Northern Fleet headquarters in Severomorsk while surfaced—which is not the most enjoyable way for a submarine to travel. The big submarine has also stayed in loose formation with Piotr Velikiy and their tugboat chaperone. Force protection around the vessels looks surprisingly light, and a single armed soldier was seen standing alone on the conning tower of the Donskoy. A single armed soldier stands guard atop the Donskoy’s massive conning tower. The US Navy also often places an armed sailor with a light machine gun on a submarine’s sail when traveling through tight waters while surfaced.  , Screenshot via Danmark Tv2 Both ships, along with roughly ten others from the Northern Fleet and many more from the Baltic Fleet, are to take part in a large naval parade on July 30th in St. Petersburg. The event is being put on to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Russian Navy. A Chinese naval task force of three vessels, including an example of Beijing’s most advanced operational surface combatant, is also set to enter the confines of the Baltic Sea for naval drills with the Russians. This all equates to a huge amount of Russian naval firepower being concentrated in “NATO’s swimming pool” at the same time, raising tensions in an already highly tense region .

NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center is posting hundreds of film clips to Youtube from the agency’s flight test activities at Dryden/Edwards AFB over the decades, many of which have never been seen before. So far they have posted a few hundred videos, and a handful of them feature the legendary YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird . Videos of the X-45 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) were also posted. As we have discussed in great depth before , it’s amazing that networked UCAV technology was proven nearly a decade and a half ago. There are also some great clips of the X-40 Space Maneuver Vehicle in testing. This was the forerunner to the USAF’s successful X-37B orbiter that makes so many headlines today. Finally, a couple XB-70 Valkyrie videos were posted as well—it’s an aircraft we can’t get enough of. This is just a sampling of the various playlists that are offered up, so make sure you go other to Armstrong Flight Research Center’s Youtube page to browse the whole archive, and more videos are supposedly going to be uploaded soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 17, 2020",Report Says Missile Defense Test Failed Because Sailor Pushed The Wrong Button,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A high profile and high stakes test of Raytheon’s new SM-3 Block IIA interceptor and the Aegis Combat System against an intermediate range ballistic missile failed last June . The misfire occurred not because a high-tech sensor broke down or the missile’s infrared hit-to-kill vehicle got confused, but because someone pushed the wrong button. According to Defense News , the test’s failure occurred because a sailor in charge of tactical data links inside the Combat Information Center aboard the USS John Paul Jones— the Navy’s ballistic missile defense test ship — pressed a button that resulted in the command self-destruct of the experimental missile as it was hurtling towards its target. The button in question is used to designate incoming targets as hostile or friendly. The sailor supposedly pushed “friendly” by accident which resulted in a data-link transmission to the missile to end its intercept immediately. It did just that by blowing itself to smithereens. At least we know the self destruct works, right? SM-3 Block IIA missile., Raytheron The Navy won’t comment on the sailor’s supposed error, but has come out and said that neither the missile nor the Aegis Combat System aboard the ship were to blame for the test’s failure based on the data collected during the botched engagement and after-action reports by those involved. The investigation is still underway, so more details may surface that provide a better idea as to the circumstances surrounding the mistake. At this moment the news is surely a relief to contractors involved with the test—primarily Raytheon who makes the SM-3 interceptors. It is also fairly good news for the US and Japan who are working together on the program, as the seemingly simple mistake may have been costly, but it is likely far less so than if the failure were attributed to a major systemic issue with the SM-3 Block IIA and its underlying technology. The SM-3 Block IIA’s capabilities, which you can read all about here , could help partially satisfy the pressing need for bolstered ballistic missile defenses in the Pacific theatre. North Korea’s rapidly evolving missile prowess is turning a theoretical future threat into a tangible one today. General Joseph Dunford gave this frank assessment of the situation yesterday, although his claims that we can reliably defend against an attack at this time may be true on paper, but less so in reality. The SM-3 Block IIA missile, once operational, could not only equip ballistic missile defense capable destroyers and cruisers from the navies of both Japan and the US, but it could also fill the vertical launch cells of Aegis Ashore installations that Japan is likely to begin constructing . Even the missile’s basic “rocket stack” design, which uses nearly all the edge-to-edge width of a Mark 41 vertical launch system (VLS) cell, could be used for other applications in the future, like prompt global strike or defending against high and very fast flying hypersonic threats . The failed test in June was the fourth time a SM-3 Block IIA was test flown, and the first time it was fired from a ship. All other tests have been successful. We’ll now have to wait till the missile’s next test flight to see if it actually works in a semi-operational setting. But the truth is the technology is highly promising, especially among other ballistic missile defense concepts, and worth pursuing despite anything but the most critical of issues that may pop up during its development cycle.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s that time of year again! The Experimental Aircraft Association’s mega Airventure air show and fly-in is underway in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and as usual the USAF has shown up in force. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Air Force’s founding, and the 75th anniversary of the mighty 8th Air Force. With this in mind, Oshkosh planners have worked with warbird operators and the Air Force to execute a number of commemorative flyovers , including one with a B-1, B-2 , B-52 and all the prominent WWII bomber types. But yesterday’s twilight portion of the show kicked off the week with a bomber spectacle to behold in itself. A B-1B took to the evening skies over Wittman Regional Airport on Wednesday for its demonstration, which is always a sight to see and a racket to hear. But due to the low-light and moist air, the display took on a unique atmosphere. The “Bone” tore the sky apart with its thunderous GE-F101 turbofans and hurtling mass of swing-wing glory. At times the big jet was almost totally engulfed in vapor “capes” with its glowing and crackling afterburners sticking out the back, adding to the drama significantly. Our good friends over at the marvelous Airshowstuff.com were there as usual to capture the awesome spectacle as only they can. It’s their pictures and video that adorn this article. Make sure you check their site out and their Youtube channel is also a must click.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 29, 2017",Everything We Know The Day After North Korea Launched Its Most Threatening Missile Yet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In less than a year and a half , North Korea went from parading supposed long-range missiles around a couple times a year to a country with a credible intercontinental ballistic missile capability. Even more impressive, in just the span of July, the North Koreans introduced their first ICBM to the world via a successful test launch , and have now fired the second and improved iteration of that same missile design. Here’s what we know a day after the provocative test launch was executed. The second test of what appears to be an upgraded Hwasong-14 ICBM flew longer, higher, and farther than the type’s initial successful test launch on the 4th of July. The road-mobile missile took a steep parabolic trajectory to 2,300 miles above the earth. Nearly ten times the orbital height of the International Space Station. It covered a distance of 620 miles and spent roughly 47 minutes in the air. All of these stats show a significant improvement over the first Hwasong-14 test, and now, by most accounts, they give the missile the ability to strike roughly half the continental United States, including Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles, with a nuclear payload. Graphic from Yonhap showing the July 28 Hwasong-14 ICBM test out of #NorthKorea w/ a maximum range of 10,000 km. pic.twitter.com/cHVNmhVWX7 — Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) July 29, 2017 This dreaded moment, one that has been long in the making and highly feared, came much sooner than most analysts expected. US intelligence agencies in particular have chronically underestimated the North Koreans—and the Chinese to a large degree—over the last decade and a half. But regardless of who predicted what and when, the time has officially come when North Korea has a missile that can put the continental US under direct threat of an attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZVIbYiWAHE Yet it seems that people are so accustomed to threatening news about North Korea, and particularly their missiles, that the reaction, at least here in the US, has been somewhat subdued. Maybe this is also because it has finally been made clear by the press and by key military leaders that there is no good military solution to the North Korean issue— at least one that doesn’t include massive loss of life and the economic and social disruption of the majority of a hemisphere. For Japan the issue is much closer to home and far more tangible. A record number of bomb shelters being ordered by the public and the Japanese government working to substantially enhance its missile defenses and the public’s ability to survive an onslaught. Although North Korea now has a missile capable of putting the continental United States at risk, it has been hotly debated if they also possess a reentry vehicle and warhead that could survive diabolical trip to its target. North Korea claims it has tested a miniaturized nuclear device, and we have seen images of such a device in Kim Jong Un’s own mitts. North Korea also claims they have a reentry vehicle capable of accomplishing its one-way mission, but many analysts disagree with Pyongyang’s proclamations. Some sources have said the reentry vehicle used for the July 4th test broke apart upon reentry. But yesterday some pretty amazing video was captured by local news cameras on the Island of Hokkaido showing North Korea’s glowing reentry vehicle splashing down near the Japanese shores. NEW footage via @nhk_news of #NorthKorea 's rocket launch from off the coast of #Hokkaido . pic.twitter.com/d9eIYui0gd — The Intel Crab (@IntelCrab) July 28, 2017 Open source intelligence gatherers have been able to find the locations of where the videos were shot, and from that alone it may be possible to search for what’s left of the reentry vehicle. Obviously US, Japanese and South Korean intelligence gathering capabilities would likely have a much better idea as to its location. If it can be recovered, it could give unprecedented insights as to how far North Korea’s reentry vehicle program has really progressed, and thus what the status of the country’s overall nuclear weapons delivery system is at this time. We also have what appears to be a location for the missile’s launch site, near Jonchon, North Korea. The fact that it was executed at night, and in an area that doesn’t appear to be improved for missile operations, aimed to tell the US, South Korea, and their allies that they can launch even their largest missiles seemingly anywhere and at any time of day. Here are some of the stills coming out of North showing the launch: North Korea State Media North Korean State Media North Korean State Media North Korean State Media North Korean State Media Some even spotted what appears to be Jim Jong Un decoys running around the launcher while the missile was being set up. Although black suits similar to Kim Jong Un’s are not uncommon in North Korea, the exact same one is. Also the haircuts are suspicious to say the least. This could have been in response to the US military’s omission that they were actively watching the launch site before the first Hwasong-14 test on July 4th. The Kim regime is paranoid of a US or South Korean decapitation strike. Seriously, you can't make this stuff up: 3 Kim Jong Uns running around Hwasong-14 as it gets separated from camouflage TEL. pic.twitter.com/bhjL9jTHTu — Noon in Korea (@NoonInKorea) July 29, 2017 As for the US, South Korea and its allies’ response to the launch, well it seems like business as usual. The US and South Korea executed a short-range ballistic missile launch of their own hours after, showing off their Hyunmoo-2 & ATACMS missiles as a silly attempt at a tit-for-tat response, just as they did on July 5th. It is also likely that we will see some USAF bombers do another useless flyby of the DMZ soon as well, just as they always seem to do. And just like clockwork, an emergency session of the UN Security Council has been called for. Yesterday’s launch will also likely put a final cap on South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in’s hopes for direct deescalation talks with North Korea. Instead the young administration will likely move away from their campaign promises of a more dovish approach to the North, will migrate toward more heavy handed military deterrence alongside their US partners. The fact of the matter is that North Korea’s missile progress has been stunning, both figuratively and literally, as regional powers and the US seem have no idea as to how to deal with Pyongyang on the issue. The Trump Administration attempted to get China to dissuade Pyongyang from further provocative acts, but this effort has clearly failed . China is now fortifying its own border with North Korea in anticipation of some sort of foreign military action against the country. If the Kim regime were to crumble, potentially millions of already hungry and largely brainwashed refugees could attempt to enter China—something Beijing seems to be preparing for in a not so humanitarian way. Still, even with the stakes being so high, US military commanders at the highest levels seem to be coming to terms with the possibility of enacting the military option among no other good alternative. This may be especially attractive as US missile defense capabilities can still potentially counter North Korea’s low-volume threat. Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford said the following last week : “As I’ve told my counterparts, both friend and foe, it is not unimaginable to have military options to respond to North Korean nuclear capability…What’s unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that would allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver, Colorado. That’s unimaginable to me. And so my job will be to develop military options to make sure that doesn’t happen… In the intelligence communities the general assessment was, and it has been public, that Kim Jong Un views his existence as inextricably linked to nuclear weapons and China will never cooperate. So those are the two things that everybody has basically said. That’s conventional wisdom of North Korea. So where does that leave us? Leaves us what, to a military option.” The Pentagon’s top uniformed official went on to say he isn’t ready for that option just yet, but he makes it clear the timeline is far shorter than some may realize when it comes to waiting out diplomatic efforts: “So I think for all of us, we should give Secretary Tillerson full support in attempting to resolve this diplomatically and economically even as we recognize that it may not happen, and there may have to be a follow-up option, which is the military option. We can wring our hands and say it will never happen or we can roll up our sleeves and make an effort to have a concerted economic and diplomatic plan that does cause KJU, Kim Jong Un, to come to the table and begin to have a conversation, at least stop the path that he’s on right now, which is further development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear capability, and to me it makes all the sense in the world to prove the theory of the case and to work this for a few more months.” AP President Trump has made big claims about not letting North Korea get its hands on a missile that can reach the US or a device to load aboard it. But so far the administration has been helpless when it comes to slowing Pyongyang’s progress. With lines drawn in the sand already being stepped over, one must ask themselves if Trump and his national security team will have any good choice, especially politically, but to act against North Korea in some military fashion in the coming months. The last straw could come in the form of a long-awaited sixth nuclear bomb test by North Korea. So far, Pyongyang has stuck to advancing its missile programs and not further evolving its miniaturized warhead capabilities through live detonations. But now, with a ICBM delivery system moving along at a quick clip, it may finally be time for North Korea to test its nuclear payload in a definitive manner. If this occurs, the chances of a military engagement will likely rise significantly, the outcome of which would be anyone’s guess. Update: 4:40pm PST — Just after posting the article above, Trump started tweeting about how China played him by doing nothing about North Korea and that he will do something about it. I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017 …they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! — Donald J.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2019","Two Tense Regions, Two Potential U.S. Foes, Two Massive Military Parades","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This weekend featured grand military parades for both China and Russia. In St. Petersberg, Russia celebrated “Navy Day” in unprecedented scale. Other naval parades were also held in other Russian ports, including hot spots Sevastopol, Crimea and Tartus, Syria. China’s parade, which took place at the remote Zhurihe military base in Inner Mongolia, was focused on land and in the air, celebrating the 90th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army. In both events, the country’s leaders were the stars of the show, with Putin overseeing festivities in St. Petersburg and a military fatigue wearing Xi Jinping presiding over the display of military might in Zhurihe. Navy Day is not new to Russia, it usually takes place the last Sunday in July, but the scope of this Navy Day is. The new prominence of the annual event supposedly revives the tradition started by Peter the Great in 1714. Above all else, it is a perfect prism for which the Kremlin can show off its modernizing naval forces and key alliances to the world. The first video features great coverage of the entire St. Petersburg portion of Navy Day. The second is of Navy Day in Russia’s expanded port facility in Tartus, Syria. The third is of Navy Day in Sevastopol, Crimea, which includes some live fire drills: https://youtube.com/watch?v=-VCNximJJy8 https://youtube.com/watch?v=AsvdjJudnAE https://youtube.com/watch?v=hYIUTIKN6mU We have tracked the unprecedented deployment of Russia’s largest surface combatant and submarine—both of which are nuclear powered relics from the height of the latter Cold War—from the announcement that they would be included in the parade, through their high-profile voyage from the Barents Sea to St. Petersburg. We also detailed China’s naval task force’s arrival in the Black Sea. Their ships, a destroyer, a frigate and a supply ship, also took part in the parade—a major symbol of the deepening military ties between Moscow and Beijing. All in all, some 50 ships and submarines were involved in the parade, as well as nearly as many helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Also, for the first time ever, 5,000 sailors from the Baltic, Northern, Caspian and Black Sea Fleets all took part in the parade in St. Petersburg. President Putin said following during an address to sailors participating in the naval review: “The Navy and commitment to Fatherland are inseparable. As Admiral Nakhimov used to say, a sailor has neither an easy nor difficult path, but rather a glorious one. And everyone currently serving, in our ground forces and submarines, in the marine air force, in the coastal defense, and those who work in the shipbuilding industry, all are faithful to these vows. Their high moral and professional qualities have been and will remain the foundation of successful service in the Navy, and the state will offer its full support…Thank you for your readiness and your ability to solve the most complicated tasks, for your worthy service and your unwavering allegiance to our Motherland and to our people.” Nearly a hemisphere away, over at China’s massive Zhurihe military training complex in Mongolia, the affair was a bit more ominous, with throngs of soldiers, military vehicles and aircraft showing off above all else their shear volume and capacity for warfare. 12,000 troops, 100 aircraft and 600 pieces of ground based weaponry were put on display. These included China’s first operational stealth fighter, the J-20, and the PLA’s new DF-31AG offroad-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. The type is a more capable evolution of China’s DF-31A, which likely includes multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Throngs of other ballistic missiles were displayed as well as rows of transporter-erector-launchers passed through the parade grounds. Here is a video of the entire parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army: The big show of force came somewhat as a surprise, at least officially, as the Chinese government formally announced the display just a day before it occurred. It also started just over a day after North Korea executed its most menacing missile test yet, and mere hours after President Trump tweeted about how China was “all talk” when it came to dealing with North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs even while they make billions from the US on trade, and that “we will no longer allow this to continue.” During the parade, Xi Jinping learned heavy on party propaganda, stating : “Troops across the entire military, you must be unwavering in upholding the bedrock principle of absolute party leadership of the military… Always obey and follow the party. Go and fight wherever the party points.” Jinping has been working to consolidate power in an attempt to gain another five year term as China’s top Communist Party official. Above all else, both parades are a reminder of rising global military competition with the US.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 28, 2017",Russia’s Air Base In Syria Is Now Filled With Advanced Multi-Role Fighters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New satellite images show a big change in force structure at Russia’s Hmeymin airbase in Syria . The photos show no less than 20 of Russia”s most capable fighters—a mix of Su-27/30/34/35s at the base. This is a substantial leap in advanced fighter aircraft capacity compared to what has historically been forward deployed to the outpost. In the past, older attack aircraft, namely Su-24 Fencers and Su-25s Frogfoots, were the most numerous types of fixed-wing combat aircraft at the installation. In fact, as little as four fighter aircraft have been deployed to the base at one time, with their primary duties being air defense. But that number had grown over time, with a few temporary exceptions, but not to this degree. The latest imagery, which is dated 15 July, 2017, depicts a rebalance of aerial assets of sorts, with a greater emphasis of fighters than attack jets. The photos show 11 Su-24 Fencers, and just three Su-25s. Both types are used exclusively for delivering air-to-ground munitions and are less advanced technologically than their Flanker derivative fighter counterparts. As far as fighters go, there are three Su-27SM3s—we originally noted the upgraded air-to-air fighter’s presence a month ago during a visit to the base by Bashar al Assad—and six of Russia’s most advanced multi-role fighter aircraft, the Su-35S . There are also six Su-34 Fullback fighter-bombers , as well as four Su-30SM multi-role fighters shown in the satellite photos. The change in force mix away from Russia’s more rudimentary attack aircraft to its most capable fighters, many of which have muti-role abilities—at least when it comes to slinging dumb bombs and firing rockets—is likely the result of multiple factors. First off, the shooting down of a Syrian Su-22 Fitter attack jet by a Navy Super Hornet last June almost certainly factored in to Russia’s in-country air combat capabilities master plan. Jets like the Su-30, Su-35 and Su-34 can attack ground targets and defend themselves from aerial threats without the need for dedicated air cover. Just the fact that the Su-27 Flanker and its many derivatives remain very capable in the within visual range air combat arena is also a deterrent in itself as the crowded airspace over the embattled country and tight rules of engagement makes that realm of air-to-air combat the most probable one to occur, even if such an engagement remains a very unlikely prospect in reality. Also, Moscow has ordered more air defense capability to defend its interests in Syria every time some sort of kinetic act against it or the Assad regime occurs. This has come in the form of advanced surface-to-air missiles systems—the S-300 near Tartus and the S-400 at Hmeymin air base—as well as more fighter aircraft capable of fielding combat air patrols being sent to the country. These types of air defense upgrades occurred following the shoot-down of a Russian Su-24 by a Turkish F-16s as well as following America’s Tomahawk missile attacks on Shayrat Air Base in central Syria. It makes sense that Russia did the same thing when the US downed the Syrian Su-22, hence the arrival of the Su-27SM3s, and the greater fighter contingent overall. SU-30SMs sit at Russia’s base in Syria, a Hind flies above. The Su-30s have become more numerous in the RuAF’s inventory, and they even fly with the Russian Knights aerobatic team., AP Secondly, Russia’s recapitalization of their air combat fleet has progressed steadily in the nearly two years since the country deployed air power to Syria. All types of new Flankers, including the Su-35S, have continued to roll off production lines, and many existing Su-27s have undergone upgrades through modernization programs. Simply put, there are more modern multi-role airframes of this sort now available than there were two years ago, and their capabilities are better tested and operationally refined. In addition to the tactical aircraft, the satellite caught other fixed wing aircraft and improvements that are ongoing to the expanding base. A single A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and control aircraft is seen on the ramp. A IL-20 “Coot” spy plane can also be seen near the A-50—both aircraft are known to have been operating over Syria for some time now. A pair what looks like An-24 “Cokes” are also on the base’s southern apron. These aircraft are likely used as intra-theater transports and for liaison duties between the Syrian government and the Russian military. Above all else, the fairly drastic reformation of Russia’s aerial combat capabilities in Syria is another reminder how much the conflict has modernized—and become more internationally volatile—since Russia arrived in September of 2015, not to mention since the civil war broke out in 2011. It also underlines how Russia sees the US led coalition—as a real threat to its aims and ambitions in Syria and the region as a whole. The fact of the matter is that those fighters jets won’t be going anywhere soon. Just as we predicted years ago, part of the deal the Kremlin worked out for saving Assad from immanent defeat was a long-term military presence in the country, which is strategically placed in the Middle East and also on the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean. This included the Kremlin being awarded an expanded and indefinite hold on their port facilities in Tartus, as well as Russia getting its own airbase south of Latakia, which was originally referred to by Moscow as “temporary” in nature. Putin and Assad., AP Just days ago, Russia made their long term grasp on their “temporary” air base in Syria official, signing a whopping 49 year “lease” for it with the Assad regime. A similar deal was made for an expanded Russian naval base in Tartus months ago. And this is principally why Russia hasn’t wanted Assad, or at least someone or some organization with Assad’s same grand affection towards Moscow, losing control of Syria. It would mean Russia’s key strategic bases in that country—including their only warm water port on the Mediterranean—would go with him. Now there is more capable aerial firepower deployed to Russia’s air base south of Latakia than ever to make sure that doesn’t happen.

The Alaska-based aggressors are adorned with some awesome looking paint schemes, and recently they debuted their “splinter blizzard” motif. But an entirely new look popped up for this Red Flag Alaska—a sinister, light-sucking flat black with red highlights paint job—an iconic look most known for its use on the SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft than on potentially hostile fighters. SR-71 and its iconic flat black and red motif. This same scheme is shared by the U-2 Dragon Ladies and their associate T-38 Talons today, although the T-38s are glossy black. , USAF A U-2 Dragon Lady wearing her distinctive flat black and red paint scheme while deployed to the Middle East. , USAF Then again, the scheme does feature some gray tones, most notably on the F-16’s radome. This is somewhat similar to what China’s prototype J-31 fighter flew with, but that aircraft was far from production, with the type now flying in its second and more refined developmental configuration. The first examples of the larger and more advanced J-20 also wore a similar dark gray and red scheme. The J-31 prototype seen flying in a similar scheme at the Zhuhai Air Show in 2014. , AP The scheme is also reminiscent of the ones flown on the “MiG-28s” (F-5E/Fs) during the making of Top Gun . Navy’s F-5 aggressor community—which includes—VFC-111 out of NAS Key West and VFC-13 out of NAS Fallon, Nevada—still paints at least one of their jets in this famous “Hollywood” scheme, although it is high gloss black, not flat black. VFC-13’s F-5F wearing a “MiG-28” scheme., USN The paint job could also be some historical callback to the P-61 Black Widow night fighter, an aircraft that also wore red details over a flat black paint job. The 18th AGRS traces its roots back to before World War II. During the war the unit’s predecessor, the 18th Fighter Squadron , flew P-39s, P-40s, P-51s and P-38s, but there doesn’t seem to be a direct connection to the squadron and the P-61 Black Widow. One of the more elaborately decorated P-61s. , USAF Creative new adversary paint jobs have come back in vogue as of late, with USAF and Navy aggressor squadrons introducing some pretty smashing and relevant schemes in recent years. As for Eielson’s 18th Aggressor Squadron, the unit flies more advanced and powerful F-16s than their higher profile counterparts, the 64th Aggressor Squadron , based at Nellis AFB. In recent months, 18th AGRS Vipers have been seen flying with advanced EL/L-8212 electronic warfare pods and Sniper targeting pods, the former of which can also be used for long-range air-to-air optical detection and identification. It isn’t clear if the 18th AGRS has a s econdary air defense role like their Nellis based counterparts. Red Flag 17-3, which runs from July 27th through August 11th, mirrors Red Flag exercises that take place over the Nellis Range Complex in Nevada, with some differences. Namely, the ranges in Alaska, many of which are instrumented, are enormous, and can include a more varied array of assets. As an Eielson press release states, “the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex; the largest instrumental air, ground and electronic combat training range in the world, covering more than 67,000 square miles.” The 18th AGRS stays busy year round and provides regular adversary support to F-22 Raptors based at Elmendorf AFB., USAF Red Flag was originally designed decades ago to give aircrews their first ten “combat missions” in a hyper-realistic training environment. In many ways this has not changed, although the mock air battles have gotten far more complex and now includes live virtual constructive training and little seen elements of space, electronic and cyber warfare as well. According to the USAF, Units participating in Red Flag Alaska 17-3 include: “The 18th Aggressor Squadron, Eielson AFB, Alaska; the 80th Fighter Squadron, Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea; the Electronic Attack Squadron 138, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Wash.; the 391st Fighter Squadron, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho; the 425th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Canadian Forces Base Bagotville, Canada; the 437th Transport Squadron, Canadian Forces Base Trenton, Canada; the 909th Air Refueling Squadron, Kadena AB, Japan; the 168th Air Wing, Eielson AFB, Alaska; the 96th Bomb Squadron, Barksdale AFB, La.; the 210th Rescue Squadron, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; the 746th Test Squadron, Holloman AFB, New Mexico; the 129th and 131st Rescue Squadrons out of Moffett Air National Guard Base, Cali.; and the Naval Special Warfare Special Operations Forces from Virginia.” We have reached out to Eielson AFB and the 18th AGRS to find out more about this evil looking new aggressor scheme.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 15, 2017",VH-92A Marine One Replacement Helicopter Has Taken Its First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The helicopter that will replace both the venerable VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters, referred to as Marine One when the President is onboard, has taken to the skies for the very first time. The VH-92A , which has been adapted from the Sikorsky S-92 Helibus, is slated to achieve initial operating capability in 2020, but before then it will have to go through a arduous series of flight and systems integration tests. The first of these flight test programs will total 250 hours and will occur at Lockheed’s facilities in Owego, New York. Lockheed has owned Sikorsky Helicopter since 2015. Today’s inaugural flight took place at Sikorsky’s headquarters in Stratford, Connecticut. Actually two flights occurred today totaling one hour in duration. They included basic hover and slow-speed handling characteristics tests as well as a higher-speed pass over the airfield. Spencer Elani, the director of the VH-92A program at Sikorsky, said this following the flight: “This first flight of the VH-92A configured test aircraft is an important milestone for the program. Having independently tested the aircraft’s components and subsystems, we are now moving forward to begin full aircraft system qualification via the flight test program.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=y6jKPtLNlvk Another test aircraft will join the one flown today later in the year as part of Sikorsky’s six aircraft, $1.24B development contract with the Navy. The four others will be early production examples. A follow-on contract that is supposed to be executed in 2019 will include the remaining 17 aircraft that will make up the “White Top” presidential airlift fleet flown by HMX-1 out of Quantico , Virginia. The unit also flies MV-22 Ospreys, which are used for testing and tactics development, as well as moving around the White House staff and the press corps when the President is traveling. Once turned over to the Pentagon after a 12 month flight test period, the VH-92As will be the first S-92 derivatives officially in the Pentagon’s inventory, although a handful of shadowy S-92s are leased to the US government for war zone operations.  But that doesn’t mean the S-92 is a new design. The basic aircraft first flew in late 1998, and was deemed operational in 2004. Since then the type has flown over 1,000,000 hours. The aircraft has had its share of teething issues , but S-92s are flown by militaries and commercial operators around the globe, and is especially popular in the tough oil platform shuttle mission set and the VVIP transport role . Another rendering of the VH-92A., NAVAIR The news comes at a good time for Sikorsky, whose S-97 Raider propeller-driven compound helicopter had a hard landing at their Palm Beach test facility yesterday. A lot is riding on the basic technology behind the Raider as its larger cousin that is currently in development, the SB-1 Defiant , is going up primarily against Bell’s V-280 Valor for the initial Future Vertical Lift competition. If the VH-92 gets successfully fielded, it will mark the end to a long and at times highly controversial path to replacing “Marine One.” I wrote the following last December at the height of President Trump’s Twitter war on prime aerospace contractors: There’s no question requirement creep for this type of program can quickly get out of control. Case in point: The VH-71 Kestrel program that aimed to replace current VH-3D and VH-60N “Marine One” helicopters with the European-designed, triple-engined, and US assembled derivative of the EH-101. Things got so out of hand during the helicopter’s concurrent development process that each of the 23 helicopters was slated to cost over $550 million—more than three times the original eyebrow-raising estimate. The program was cancelled after billions were spent, and the nine aircraft in various stages of completion at the time of program’s termination were sold-off to Canada for a sickening $164 million to support their troubled Cormorant rescue helicopter program. A new program is now underway to replace Marine One , this time with the twin-engined Sikorsky S-92 as the base platform. Even this less-ambitious endeavour may be fiscally unpalatable for President Elect Trump, at least at first glance. What’s interesting is that the VH-71 program was cancelled by President Obama, who made a very similar off-the-cuff quip about it shortly after being elected, stating: “By the way, I’ve already talked to Gates about a thorough review of the helicopter situation. The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me.” He also added “It is an example of the procurement process gone amok, and we’re going to have to fix it.” The defunct VH-71 program, which was based on the triple engine EH-101/US-101,  was the poster child for a defense program that spiraled totally out of control., USMC Now, as the Pentagon aims to reform its procurement practices, the VH-92A program will have to keep close to its schedule and cost projections in order to stay out of the President’s social media crosshairs. And this may not be an easy task as the helicopter will be stuffed with the most capable self protection and communications suites on the planet, among many other custom modifications ordered by the White House. All of it has to work together and in a safer manner than any other helicopter on the planet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",F-35B Pilots Will Make Rolling Landings Like This To Board Royal Navy Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fixed-wing aircraft carrier aviation is not cheap, and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft have a limited ability to bring back unspent fuel and ordnance to the ship after a mission is completed. This means good gas gets dumped, and even worse, weapons that cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars get jettisoned into the sea. The Royal Navy wants their F-35Bs to be able to the return to the ship with more gas and weapons than they normally could by landing vertically on the decks of their two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. The aim is to accomplish this by making a slow-speed—57 knots indicated airspeed to be exact—rolling recovery down the ship’s landing and departure area, instead of a vertical landing . Officially this hybrid maneuver, which uses lift from the aircraft’s wings and thrust from its engine and lift fan, has been dubbed a “Shipborne Rolling Vertical Landing,” or SRVL for short. Another advantage of standardizing this recovery concept is that it will put less wear and tear on the F-35B’s costly lift fan and its associated subsystems and linkages—a move that could potentially save large sums of money over the aircraft’s operational life. It would also help alleviating thermal wear on the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales titanium injected deck coatings. And why not do it? The Royal Navy spent a lot of money building massive carriers for STOVL aircraft that can operate from much smaller ships . The ability to field this maneuver operationally, and to bring back more gas and munitions while prolonging hardware life could be another set of reasons used to justify those costs. UK F-35B pilots have been working on perfecting this landing concept in the simulator, a video of which you can see below. Make sure you have the audio on so you can hear the play-by-play narration. Also note the little pictograph of the F-35 in the lower left corner of the Helmet Mounted Display’s virtual HUD . It appears to show show the pilot the lift fan and main engine RPM. Pretty neat stuff. The AV-8B Harrier also executes rolling landings, but its propulsion concept is totally different than the F-35B’s. The Harrier relies on swiveling nozzles, two hot and two cold, along the sides of its fuselage, instead of a large geared lift fan linked to the jet’s main engine and an elaborate swiveling main exhaust nozzle as found on the F-35B. Harriers usually make these rolling landings on runways and they are not common practice for shipboard operations. As for the possibility of adapting this same technique for F-35B operations aboard US “Gator Navy” LHD and LHAs , that’s uncertain, although the operating and parking areas are much tighter on those ships than they are on the Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth class carriers. The difference in landing weight margin this recovery concept will afford the F-35B also isn’t clear. The F-35B’s takeoff and landing weight metrics are fairly opaque, but the B model cannot carry 2,000lb weapons internally, with its smaller bays capable of carrying 1,000lb class and smaller weapons. But for most missions the F-35B won’t need stealth and can carry a larger and more diverse load of munitions and stores on its wing and centerline stations. In that case, clearly bring-back capability will be a major issue. The deck of the HMS Queen Elizabeth is roomy to say the least., AP Being able to land with more gas saves money and helps with logistics because that fuel can be used on another mission. But most importantly, it also increases the safety margins for F-35 pilots—especially when operating from the ship in adverse weather. Video shows F-35B training on a mock-up of a LHD deck and superstructure near Yuma, Arizona. The F-35B normally lands aboard a ship just like the Harrier, approaching slowly from the left over the water, stabilizing in hover and then moving laterally over the deck, before decreasing thrust until the aircraft touches down in its landing spot : This method of recovery may be able to allow F-35Bs to better integrate with the operations of catapult and barrier arrested recovery aircraft carriers—specifically the US Navy’s nuclear powered supercarriers. At this time there aren’t any plans to integrate the F-35B model into the supercarrier’s air wing, although the possibility of doing so was was briefly evaluated. Operational issues with the F-35B’s launch, and especially its recovery cycle, and the fact that the B model is less capable in terms of range and payload than the C model, left Navy and Marine planners with the conclusion that cross-decking the B model to supercarriers wasn’t a great idea. The Harrier was evaluated for a similar arrangement, even being deployed at the squadron level with a carrier air wing early on. Even though it did operate from the Navy’s big flattops on a few occasions decades later, the concept really never took hold. But maybe there is a possibility that the F-35B’s story could be different due to this new recovery method, which could allows the B model to better fit into high-tempo the ship’s recovery flow . AV-8B lands aboard the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) during Desert Storm., USN Currently the USMC plans to buy a number of C model F-35s in order to fulfill its limited carrier air wing fighter squadron contribution. But if the Navy were to successfully test the B model aboard a CVN with this landing new concept, maybe the USMC wound’t have to buy any C models at all. Here is what the shipboard rolling vertical landing looks like from the HMS Queen Elizabeth’s tower’s perspective, as well as a vertical landing: Still, simulating something is different than doing it in real life consistently and in different weather conditions and sea states. Also, the whole affair relies heavily on the F-35’s digital anti-skid breaking system. It would be interesting to hear what would happen if that system failed and the jet was sent careening down the deck towards the ship’s ski jump at highway speeds, or even worse, into rows of aircraft parked on each side of the landing area. If these concerns can be minimized, there is no doubt that this promising technique could expand the capability of the F-35B and the UK’s new carrier force. The F-35B is slated to begin trials aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth next year. We will keep an eye on how this concept of operations unfolds and keep you updated. Hat tip to UK Defense Journal.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 6, 2017",Trump Conjures Up North Korean Hysteria As Window For A Negotiated Solution Closes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A storm of North Korean hysteria hit the US this week, and with it have come story after story that allude to the specter of a war and even nuclear exchange . People are worried that war is coming, and rightfully so. But the strange thing about it is that this new phase in the North Korean standoff was largely born out of nothing—at least nothing in material. Instead it was largely fabricated by the President if the United States himself. For all intents of and purposes, things are the same this week as they were last week when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. What has occurred was an alarming “off-the-cuff” moment by President Trump and the “leaking” of a report that just affirmed what was largely already a given—that North Korea has a miniaturized nuclear warhead design—something they have outright claimed over and over and has been assumed to be the case in most national security circles. In essence, this new hyper-volatile phase of the standoff with North Korea was built on messaging alone—in other words bullshit—and the media has only perpetuated this pseudo-reality. The rhetorical shot heard around the world So our Commander In Chief, who loves to just play it by ear, made his now infamous cross-armed statement from his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey on Tuesday, stating: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States… He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire and fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.” What a stupid, short sighted, and downright reckless thing to say considering what’s at risk. In fact, using rhetoric like “fire and fury” make it sound like Trump and Kim deserve each other and it lowers the bar once again in regards to what’s expected from the historically steady hand and calming tone of the American Presidency. It’s tough guy talk for tough guy talk’s sake, and it plays right into the hand of Kim Jong Un’s paranoid notions, propaganda machine and adversarial view of the US and its allies. Above all else, it is trolling for escalation and for a response from the North Korean regime. And that is exactly what we got. Some have attempted to fill in the strategic cracks left by Trump’s belligerent statement by claiming it was a protracted play to speak in terms similar to those used by Kim Jong Un. Basically an attempt to speak in Kim’s “own language” which is an oxymoron in itself. This is a sorry attempt by the Trump’s ever-present peripheral messaging machine to retcon his improvisational and often reckless use of words. In reality, it has become abundantly clear that everyone in the Washington security apparatus was taken off-guard by the ominous remark. So no, there was no grand strategy behind the statement, just Trump doing what he does. Which may be entertaining and even strangely refreshing to some, but those same people are sadly going to learn that it’s actually a high-risk, low reward personal tick, not an effective new way of conducting foreign policy from one’s hip. And it is one that is likely to get this country and its allies in a lot of trouble. Major changes in strategy and messaging regarding what could turn into a horrendous war should be carefully planned and addressed to the country in a formal setting, where the message can be fully explained and fleshed out. Otherwise Americans, our allies, and the enemy are left to fill in the blanks. Instead we get some soundbite from what looked like a luncheon at a golf resort. This is alarming to say the least and puts in doubt Trump’s ability to handle a rapidly developing high-stakes crisis not if, but when one actually occurs. Once again, this was all spurred supposedly by a classified intel report that stated something that was already more or less a given in national security circles—that North Korean scientists have built a nuclear warhead capable of riding in a missile. Of course this warhead has not been tested—both in the ground or on an actual missile. So all Trump’s outrage is really over nothing new. In essence, it is a fabrication. The Kim regime has not been shy about their development of a miniaturized nuclear device., North Korea State Media Trump came out again on Thursday and double downed on his earlier “fire and fury” statement. This is not a surprise as he always does this, regardless of the reaction or its negative impacts. He also went on to use his same ambiguous line “we’ll see what happens” when it comes to a possible preemptive strike on North Korea and what comes next in standoff. He also said seemed to think negotiations were futile, but said he likes to talk. See the exchange below. “The people who were questioning that statement, ‘was it too tough,’ maybe it wasn’t tough enough. They have been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years. It us about time someone stuck up for the people of other countries. So, if anything, maybe that statement wasn’t tough enough and we are backed by 100% by our military, we are backed by everybody and we are backed by many other leaders.” The President also tweeted claims regarding America’s nuclear arsenal, which were a flat out lie—or even worse—a delusion, stating: “My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before…. Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!” No, that was not his first order as President, and really there has been no change between the modernization plans under President Obama and those under President Trump, aside from an ongoing nuclear posture review and Trump simply telling the DoD to make sure they are ready to execute a nuclear attack if he orders one. So once again, this was either a lie or a figment of his imagination. Either way it is unacceptable, and for a guy that talked loosely about the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons constantly during his campaign, while not even knowing what the nuclear triad is, more big talk about nukes sure isn’t encouraging. Also, this same man now resides no more than a couple dozen feet away from the nuclear football at all times and carries a nuclear biscuit containing the gold codes to use it in his pocket, and there isn’t really anyone who could stop him from doing so. Really, who is he talking to with messages like this? His base who wants a strongman in office or the enemy? If it’s the former, does he really think North Korea’s military intelligence isn’t aware of America’s nuclear capabilities? Frankly, it’s moronic. The media fans Trump’s ‘fire and fury’ flames Shortly after Trump’s tough talk came North Korea’s nerve rattling response, which (surprise!, surprise!) wasn’t “yes Mr. Trump we have seen the error in our ways now that you have threatened us with hyperbolic tyrant language.” Instead the North Koreans brushed Trump’s bluster aside and said they will now put together a plan to demonstrate their downrange ballistic missile attack capability by launching intermediate-range ballistic missiles towards Guam. The mainstream media jumped on this and declared that North Korea was finalizing its attack plans on Guam. That simply wasn’t the case. Once again, Pyongyang threatened to demonstrate their abilities, not execute an actual strike, with their statement saying that the country would launch four Hwasong-12 missiles and that they would land 30-40km off the coast of Guam as a show of force if Kim ordered the execution of the plan in development. So no, North Korea isn’t threatening to strike Guam directly, they are threatening to make a grand display proving that they could if they wanted to. Also, as we have stated many times, Guam has been equipped with a Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) battery since 2013, a unit adeptly named the “Musudan Manglers,” that is capable of fending off low-volume intermediate-range ballistic missile attacks. Aegis missile defense equipped surface combatants could also potentially shoot these missiles down during their mid-course phase of flight, and seeing as they would have to fly over Japanese territory to get to Guam, there would be a good reason for doing so. MDA But it is worth underlining America’s missile defense systems do not equal a missile shield. They still lack extensive real-world testing and some rely on a rickety network of communications and sensor systems in order to be effective. Clearly even just an inert display of ballistic missile capability would be regarded as a huge escalation and would rattle nerves in Guam and in the region overall. But still, a show of force test where the ocean is the intended target is a far cry from an actual attack. The real risk is in how the launch is initially interpreted. If it is perceived as a strike against Guam, the gears of war could already be turning with great momentum by the time the missiles arrive at their intended target. Also, do we really think North Korea doesn’t already have plans to attack Guam in place? So how is this new? Guam is the primary target for their intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which they have spent countless resources on developing. When you look at the situation through a wide angle lens, it is clear that all the latest escalation has been is largely spun up by the Trump administration and the media who seem more than willing to play along without digging into the details. And hey, it’s no secret that threatening headlines get eyeballs. Most the cable show military experts also seem to be all too willing to play along with the most threatening interpretation of recent events—or they simply haven’t done their own research on the issue and rely on highly outdated information and inaccurate assumptions for analysis. This is no real surprise either as cable news military pundits have proven to be the most chronically inaccurate sources of information on defense topics, and especially when it comes to technological capabilities of various weapon systems. Maybe one of the best instances of the press blindly buying into the North Korean hype are how they publicize B-1B bomber’s intimidation/propaganda training missions near the Korean DMZ. First off, there are always bombers forward deployed to Andersen AFB on Guam, their presence there is not a result of heightened tensions with North Korea. Second, no, for the hundredth time the B-1B is not a nuclear capable platform and it is not practicing for nuclear strikes on North Korea. Third, these flights have been occurring regularly over the last year , and similar flights have occurred like clockwork for over a decade, always after North Korea executes a provocative act. Finally, the B-1B is not going to gallantly waltz into North Korea and hit a series of targets around the country as part of a targeted preemptive strike against Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. And it definitely is not going to lead off a protracted air war over the country either. At best it would launch a series of cruise missiles from outside North Korean borders against lightly fortified targets, that is until corridors through North Korea’s air defenses have been opened up, or it would attack artillery positions along the DMZ. North Korea’s air defenses may not be advanced, although that too is changing to some degree, but they are dense and some of their systems are of the unpredictable road-mobile variety. Even with electronic warfare support and its low-altitude penetration capabilities, the B-1 is still vulnerable. Stealthy or expendable assets, such as the B-2, F-22 and cruise missiles, would initiate strikes, followed eventually by F-16CJs Wild Weasels and strike fighters to begin wiping up non-fixed surface-to-air missile and other integrated air defense system targets. All this will be supported by the full array of America’s space-based surveillance and cyber warfare capabilities. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DrRbuACl9qk In other words, any action over North Korea short of blowing up a single missile on its launch stand or having B-2s and cruise missiles go after a small set of targets would require large packages of assets. NBC reports there is a plan in place for a series of strikes directly related to North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, but once again, this would not be executed directly by the B-1s, but they could help by adding air-launched cruise missiles to the mix: “The target set, multiple sources say, would be approximately two dozen North Korean missile-launch sites, testing grounds and support facilities. The sources told NBC News they feel confident they have accurately identified a set of relevant targets.” Really, the B-2 , with its stealth design and Massive Ordnance Penetrator carrying capabilities would be needed to go after some of these targets, being that they are buried deep below mountains in fortified bunkers and outside the reach of normal “bunker buster” munitions carried by other aircraft. So by and large, this latest North Korean missile hysteria is largely manufactured through headline grabbing but outlandish messaging by Donald Trump. The media frenzy that has followed, ranging from stories stating that North Korea is going to attack Guam to the B-1B’s misunderstood training missions, is just a byproduct of that messaging. And don’t mistake tough guy talk for a new strategy, far from it in fact. We still haven’t seen any concrete changes in the way the issue is being dealt with under the Trump Administration, and we already have experienced one round of “looming attack” false bluster by the White House that ended up going nowhere. Neither side wants a fight Here’s the cold hard truth: The last thing North Korea wants to do is attack its neighbors and especially the United States. The same thing can be said for the US and its allies attacking North Korea. Any sort of conflict with North Korea will lead to an immediate negative outcome no matter how well the initial military action goes. Economies will crash and a regional Pandora’s box will be opened with countries acting in their own self interest militarily, with China being the ultimate wildcard. Above all else, the scale of death and destruction would likely be unprecedented, at least in the last half century of the planet’s history. For Pyongyang and the Kim regime the stakes are even higher, as there is no way they would succeed in a military conflict with the US. But that doesn’t mean the toll such a war would take wouldn’t be massive and last for at least a generation. Regime change in North Korea has been floated as a plausible goal of the administration since Trump took office. In reality, that is a miserable idea, and executing such a plan, through a decapitation strike or otherwise, would likely result in an outcome that would make the invasion of Iraq look like a day at the beach. North Korea presents an especially unique military and social challenge. The country’s population is already near starving and has lived under a brainwashing military state apparatus all their lives. If you don’t think Iraq was ready for democracy, North Korea may as well be an alien planet. The Kim regime also has at least a dozen—more like two or three dozen—nuclear warheads at its disposal along with other heinous weaponry. Not just that, but North Korea has a massive, albeit technologically antiquated army that is socially programmed to see the US and its allies as sub-human and monstrous enemies. The thought of attempting regime change under such circumstances is a deranged hallucination at best. Just imagine what a North Korean occupation and provisional government would look like and how long it would have to endure. An entire population would have to be sustained and reprogrammed. Secretary of Defense Mattis and other US officials scrambled to clarify Trump’s impromptu saber rattling by issuing their own statements. , AP Although we may hate this fact, Kim Jong Un brings stability to a country that is not anywhere near prepared to enter the world community peacefully. Just the shock and disorganization brought on by taking out Kim Jong Un would likely lead to a huge refugee crisis, one that China will be on the receiving end. And the question of what, or more importantly who comes next is maybe the most important unknown of all. Kim Jong Un has purged many of the established ruling class who had tight links with a few external powers, namely China. It is likely the person who replaces Kim will be just as bad if not worse than he is, and will now have to rule knowing the US and its allies are not just a historic enemy, but an active enemy that is willing to kill the country’s leadership on a whim. This plays into decades worth of propaganda, wild claims and the general narrative fed to the public by the Kim family and their henchmen. Then there is the possibility that nobody would replace Kim at all, and the country would fall into factional infighting and general chaos. For a nuclear armed state, this is the sum of all fears. So once again, there is no attractive military solution when it comes to dealing with North Korea, and calling the country’s bluff by striking at its weapons programs would likely lead to a full scale war before the aircraft have even left North Korean airspace. What’s most troubling is that the Trump administration says the only diplomatic solution will include disarmament of Kim’s nuclear and missile programs. Let me make this clear, he will never give up his pocket arsenal of nuclear weapons. The US has played right into the reasoning as to why he would never turn this arsenal over—it is a highly logical and effective deterrent that can keep a superpower that has surrounded you with superior conventional war fighting capabilities at bay. But without a vetted delivery system and warhead that arsenal is far less threatening than otherwise, which is the case for the time being. Time for a diplomatic solution dwindles With all this in mind, every minute we waste being unwilling to negotiate a deescalation deal that would include freezing Kim’s nuclear and missile programs, not eliminating them totally, the closer we come to the point where that won’t ever be an option. Once his deterrent is verified, even if he agrees to freeze it, he would still have the ability to threaten the US mainland and his neighbors with nuclear tipped missiles. Then what? Basically, if a deal can’t be made before this milestone comes to pass—the successful testing of a miniaturized warhead and its delivery system including a survivable reentry vehicle to carry said warhead— there will likely be one of two outcomes. Either war will occur or we will have to live the fact that North Korea will able to reach the US with an ever improving and increasingly arsenal of missiles and nuclear warheads. The chances that Kim will sell his verified missile and warhead technology to anyone with cold hard cash is also a given. These are the issues we should be discussing, not tough guy talk that games out in the same two outcomes, both of which are unimaginable. And once again, there would have been no escalation this week if President Trump hadn’t injected apocalyptic like language into the public sphere. President Trump has continued to push his hardline narrative via soundbites from his golf club in New Jersey. Formally addressing the nation directly on the issue and his strategy would have been a far more effective and less reckless way articulating his thoughts and plans on the crisis.  , AP Some will applaud this type of talk as “getting tough” on North Korea. But words are cheap and Kim Jong Un knows that better than anyone. Those same people who Trump’s bluster is a good thing will probably feel differently if thousands of body bags start piling up on the Korean Peninsula—including those with US military personnel inside, and the world economy crumbles and takes the US economy with it. Now the big question is where do we go from here? Trump, who claimed he would talk directly with North Korea before becoming President, is backing himself into a strategic corner and is dragging Kim Jong Un along with him. This is mainly because there is no path to exit the escalating situation being offered aside from total capitulation by the North Koreas. Disarm or we will do it for you is seemingly the ultimatum. So Kim will call Trump’s bluff, and the scary part about that is Trump will be compelled to act or look like a bag of hot air whose words mean nothing. And for a guy who seems to think everything is either huge or tiny, great or terrible, and the best or the worst, scalable reactions may elude him. So there you have it, we are now in new phase of an increasingly volatile crisis, and this phase never had to occur. It is a fabricated escalation in rhetoric that guides both sides to the point of no return, and it is indicative of a strategy that seems to offer no clear and potentially acceptable path to deescalation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 11, 2017",There Are No Signs That US Forces Are About To Go To War With North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s a simple case of rhetoric not matching actions. Despite President Donald Trump’s grandiose and reckless statements regarding North Korea, and the hysteria that has followed, there are simply no indications that the US military is preparing for a conflict with the secretive country—at least any more than they already have on a daily basis for the better part of a century. Just hours ago Trump tweeted: “Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!” US forces deployed to the Korean Peninsula, and to the region in general, already have a “fight tonight” readiness level. But beyond that, even days after Trump’s famous “fire and fury” comments, and the intense messages from US Pacific Command and Secretary of Defense James Mattis himself , no assets appear to have been, or are in the process of being shifted to the Korean theatre. None. There are no tankers dragging American aerial combat aircraft across the Pacific—especially ones like the F-22 that would be key to any fight. Extra missile defense capabilities aren’t being sent into the region and US Marines and US Army ground combat units are not being called up for a deployment to the Korean Peninsula to augment US forces already garrisoned there. No ships have been ordered to leave their births to begin their voyage toward Korean shores. Even the USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike group remains in port in nearby Yokosuka, Japan. The forces already deployed to the region are sizable for long-term strategic and defensive purposes, totaling roughly 28,000, but for a war on our own timeline they are nowhere near what would be considered adequate. If the US was planning on the possibility of even executing a limited strike on North Korea in a preemptive manner, or if it seemed North Korea could be about to strike the US or its allies’ interests nearby or abroad, massive amounts of hardware and personnel would begin pouring into the region. All this just underlines how hollow and near sighted Trump’s threats really were. He didn’t even back them with a feint of preparing for battle. This hits at the heart claims by some that this new “fiery” rhetoric is part of a bigger strategy. If that were true than we would be showing the enemy we intend to back up our words with actions. The exact opposite is happening. Trump met with his key foreign policy team this afternoon., AP This hurts America’s ability to send clear and concise messages to our enemies in the future. If we don’t back up our statements in any meaningful and tangible way, why should they ever be believed? It is truly an issue of credibility. It also just underscores further the President’s floundering relationship with the truth and with trust in general . Regardless of what side you are on politically, a President who people think is untrustworthy and who clearly has a rocky relationship with the truth is not beneficial to America’s interests. Now we have used our “more powerful rhetoric card,” albeit poorly, against North Korea, and it clearly rang hollow. What’s worse is that this is not the first time this has happened, although it is the most severe. You would think Trump would have learned his lesson when it comes to making big unsubstantiated military claims after he and his administration wrongfully touted the location of a carrier strike group that ended up being nowhere near Korean waters. Sadly this wasn’t the case. AP Maybe Trump thinks the world still lives in a limited information age, where lies have an enticing shelf life—he doesn’t even use a computer after all—but really this speaks to a deeper and more dangerous personal tick. Trump appears to think that anything can be true if he just says it is. And in this case, at the very least he could have gotten together with his military team after making his bellicose statements to see that they are backed up with some military movements. Instead there is simply no new military pressure being placed upon North Korea. Kim Jong Un and his henchmen will clearly note this disparity between the American President’s claims and the actions of the US military. The result of which will be for them to disregard any future statements from the Commander In Chief, some of which could be critical to avoiding a horrific war. This is what you get when your President’s idea of diplomacy and military strategy is a Twitter account and some fabricated outrage. Oh and Trump now says he is also mulling military intervention in Venezuela .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","Kim Jong Un Studies Guam Attack Plans, Decides To Wait And See","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tensions continue to simmer on the Korean Peninsula after a series of messages were released by both North Korea and the US in recent hours. Now there is talk that US satellites have picked up movement of launchers capable of firing Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missiles, which could indicate a coming launch. These are the same missiles North Korea said it was planning to launch towards Guam as a show of force in response to Donald Trump’s “fire and fury” comments made last week. In addition, the image above was released that shows Kim Jong Un pouring over targeting maps with his generals, with Andersen AFB—America’s sprawling master air base on Guam—projected on a large screen nearby. The photos were supposedly taken in the command post of North Korea’s Strategic Forces while Kim visited the installation. Another image in the series shows a large map with a flight path that connects North Korea’s eastern shore—possibly near the port city of Sinpo—to Guam. North Korean State Media The images show that the North Koreans are doing exactly as they said they would—putting together a plan to fire four Hwasong-12 missiles at waters located a couple dozen miles from the island of Guam as a display of their capabilities. Days ago, General Kim Rak Gyom’s stated that he would finish the plan and brief Kim Jong Un on it personally in the mid August timeframe. The “Young General” would then make the call to go ahead with it or not. This briefing has now come and gone. Kim’s visit to the headquarters of North Korea’s Strategic Forces, these photos, and word that the same type of missiles that were supposedly to be used for the plan are being moved are concerning to say the least. Yet for now it looks like Kim plans on holding off with the launch, with an official statement reading in part : “He said he said that the U.S imperialists caught the noose around their necks due to their reckless military confrontation racket, adding that he would watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees spending a hard time of minute of their miserable lot. He said he wants to advise the U.S. which is driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula into a the touch-and-go situation, running helter skelter, to take into full account gains and losses with clear head whether prevailing situation is more unfavorable for any party. In order to defuse the tensions and prevent dangerous military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary for the U.S. to make proper option first and show it through with action, as it committed provocations after introducing strategic equipment into the vicinity of the Peninsula, he said, adding that the U.S. should stop at once arrogant provocations against the DPRK and unilateral demands and not provoke it any longer. Kim Jong Un, who hadn’t been seen for two weeks, appeared today for a tour and brief at the headquarters of North Korea’s strategic forces., North Korea State Media Not only does this statement declare that Kim is in “wait and see mode,” but it also seems to mention the need for the US to give the North Koreans an “option,” which likely means a way to deescalate that is agreeable to both sides. One of my biggest criticisms of the Trump Administration’s handling of the North Korea situation is that they offer no solution to the crisis aside from war or total capitulation by Pyongyang. This includes giving up all their nuclear weapons and missile systems—a totally unrealistic demand. Yet the North Koreans seem to be indicating they would be interested in some sort of compromise or pathway out of the current standoff. Considering the stakes involved, and they are only growing more dire with every moment, this is worth exploring. North Korea wasn’t the only sending strong messages today. Defense Secretary Mattis has come up with another intense warning for North Korea, although it is one that leaves some ambiguity and flexibility, stating : “If they shoot at the United States, I’m assuming they hit the United States, then it’s game on… It could escalate into war very quickly… yes, that’s called war, if they shoot at us.” His statement gives some room for flexibility when it comes to responding to a threatening test launch by North Korea, where they fire missiles towards Guam, but not impacting the island itself. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, who is in South Korea on a military and diplomatic mission, made it clear today that it is up to the President as to how the US would respond to a launch towards Guam or any major escalation by North Korea: We’ll have to wait and see how this all plays out, but it is likely that North Korea will test a missile in the near term, even if it does not follow a trajectory towards Guam. Beyond reports of Hwasong-12 missiles being moved, there has been substantial activity observed around North Korea’s submarine base in Sinpo, where their submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) program is based. A test launch of an enhanced solid-fueled KN-11 “Polaris” missile, which is closely related to the road-mobile KN-15 , aboard the country’s sole Sinpo/Gorae class submarine would definitely rattle nerves in South Korea. The type could theoretically be launched outside of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system’s engagement envelope. Currently a single THAAD battery is located in the south-central region of South Korea. The establishment and expansion of North Korea’s SLBM program would also make regional powers, like Japan, work much harder to monitor for potential launches over a much larger area of the planet’s surface. Creating a persistent missile defense network capable of protecting all of Japan’s major population centers from an SLBM attack would also be far more costly than just defending against missiles launched from the North Korean mainland alone. KN-11 is lowered into the single vertical launch tube on North Korea’s Sinpo class submarine last Summer., North Korea State Media For South Korea, keeping tabs on all of North Korea’s aging submarine force is already nearly an impossible job. Having to continuously track and monitor their missile boats, should North Korea deploy such a force operationally, would push South Korea’s maritime patrol and anti-submarine capabilities past its breaking point. Finally, there seems to be a growing consensus that key areas of North Korea’s missile technology have been obtained through foreign sources, namely via a company based in Ukraine , although the Ukrainian government denies the allegation and says Russia is to blame. You can read the full report detailing North Korea’s use of what appears to be a derivative of the Soviet-era RD-250 rocket engine here . If these allegations are indeed accurate, they would help explain how the country has made such massive technological leaps when it comes to their IRBM and ICBM missile programs in recent months.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 18, 2019",Retired RAF Tristars Will Get New Lives As Contracted Aerial Refuellers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly three years ago to the day I wrote about the Royal Air Force’s retired fleet of Lockheed L1011 derived Tristar tankers being put up for sale. With nine aircraft available, some of them already outfitted for the tanker role, and for a very attractive price, the Tristars seemed like a perfect opportunity for a new private aerial refueling contractor to emerge. Now, this is exactly what has happened, with Tempus Applied Solutions of Texas buying six of the Tristars with the intention of entering the contracted aerial refueling market. Tempus Applied Solutions provides a wide range of aerospace products, many of which are targeted at the defense industry and the Pentagon itself. This includes modifying existing aircraft for an array of testing and operational missions, many of which center around information, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) duties. Their website describes they wide capabilities base and some of their customers: “We fly airplanes—fixed wing and rotary, manned or unmanned. From surveillance missions in Africa to flight training in Texas, Tempus Applied Solutions is a safe, reliable, and effective operator. Uniquely, we also design and modify aircraft for special missions, certify them, and provide turnkey lease and service solutions… Our clients include NASA, the United States Department of Defense, Northrop Grumman, L-3 Communications, United States Africa Command, Joint Special Operations Command, and many other government agencies, individuals, and corporations.” Two of the Tristars that Tempus plans on acquiring are setup for cargo-passenger transport, while the other four are in the tanker configuration. Tempus says they plan on keeping three L1011 tankers operational, while using the other three airframes for spares. Tristars have all but disappeared from the sky, with Orbital ATK’s “Stargazer” launch ship being the only one still operating in the United States. Keeping the three aircraft Tempus is planning on operating in the air would be a larger challenge without the spare airframes. In all about 250 L1011s were built. The existing Tristar tanker configuration includes two hose and drogue refueling systems installed on the aircraft’s empennage. This configuration allows for only one aircraft to be refueled at a time, with the other hose and drogue system acting as a spare. It is not uncommon for aircraft to break off a drogue “basket” or for other refueling components to fail, which would often result in a emergency divert by thirsty aircraft if no other tankers were nearby. As such, the Tristars offer enhanced reliability, not to mention they can hold a whopping 300,000lbs of gas. It is also possible that Tempus may add two additional refueling pods to their Tristar’s outer wing areas, allowing for three aircraft to refuel simultaneously instead of one. This was eyed by the RAF as an upgrade before the jets out of service date was deemed too soon to justify the cost. The Tristar was replaced by the Airbus A330 based Voyager multi-role tanker transport (MRTT). RAF Tristar K1 with its dual basket setup., Adrian Pingstone/wikicommons Three Tristars would represent a substantial private aerial refueling capability that the US Navy, USMC, or other foreign air arms with aircraft that use probe and drogue tanking to take advantage of. For the Navy and USMC in particular, the Tristars could offload up some of NAVAIR’s tanking demand off the USAF’s shoulders. Omega Air in particular has done this for many years now and the model, both business-wise and operationally speaking, has already been proven. Large tanker aircraft, like the L1011, could not only help for training, but they could also drag groups of fighters across oceans for deployments, while also carrying support personnel and material. These missions can tie up USAF tankers for days at a time, and thirsty fighters like the F-35B will only require more of this type of support in the future. A Tristar gets airborne., Adrian Pingstone/wikicommons Tempus CEO Scott Terry stated the following via a press release : “We are very encouraged to have found a potential solution for the shortage of AAR services that currently exist within the US Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation and many NATO/Allied air forces. We will perform the necessary inspections and evaluations over the next several weeks in order that the transaction can close as soon as possible.” The Tristars have been in storage at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome since their retirement a few years ago. Tempus will supposedly close the deal once the aircraft and their log books, as well as their support equipment are inspected. Then the aircraft will be brought back to flyable condition, which supposedly won’t be a hard thing to do, and will receive maintenance that will prepare them to be ferried to the US for further updating. Tempus says it has already started marketing the aircraft’s services to the Navy, USMC and NATO allies. Tristar being marshaled to parking while operating in the Persian Gulf. , MoD The Pentagon in general would be wise to contract out far more of its aerial tanker needs. The USAF has been especially resistant to doing so, likely do to fear that they would eventually lose large parts of the aerial refueling mission set to private contractors, and this means having fewer aircraft under its purview. The War Zone has already detailed why the USAF should move to private aerial refueling support contractors so that it can focus more on the combat tanker support mission set, stating: “I have long argued the USAF should move toward obtaining a significant portion of its aerial refueling needs from private contractors who can offer tailored tanking solutions and elastic capacity. Doing so would mean the USAF would not have to invest so heavily up-front in tanker fleets or the infrastructure needed to support them, while contractors can procure fleets of smaller and larger aircraft based on what the market demands. As the KC-46A comes online, it will be a great time for potential commercial tanker services providers to absorb retiring KC-135Rs, or introduce new platforms depending on what their customers want.  Even smaller tankers, like those based on the 737 or G550, can fulfill many missions where large tankers simply are not needed, and do so at a far lower cost. Under such a concept, it has been proven that industry, the service, and the taxpayer win. On the tanking front, Omega Air has been doing this for some time now for the Navy and international customers and other countries are following suit . Additionally, private tanker companies’ adversary air support contractor cousins will increasingly provide aggressor training for the same US Navy and USAF fighter aircraft that private tanker companies of the future could be supporting as well. Doing so will introduce competition into the marketplace and will allow the USAF to invest heavily on higher-end capabilities, like stealthy tankers , instead of maintaining a one-size fits all tanker armada. The problem is that without the weight of the USAF in the marketplace, there really won’t be a robust marketplace at all. Offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs to contractors makes so much sense, but cultural hurdles and fear of mission loss within the USAF will likely continue to block it from happening. It will take the right leadership to come along who can see the big picture over petty service heritage and cultural issues to get it done. Once the service realizes it can have more for less in the tanker department, the private tanking industry in the US will explode to meet the demand. Once again, the same thing is already happening with private adversary support contractors. It is simply too expensive and wasteful to fly an F-35 around as an intercept target for another F-35. The same can be said for putting large formations of enemies up in the air at one time to really challenge a 5th generation fighter pilot. As such, the USAF will follow the Navy’s example and will become more dependent on private adversary support companies for their training needs as their 5th generation fighter fleet continues to grow. Not embracing a similar strategy now for offsetting a portion of the USAF’s tanker needs is wasteful as procurement decisions are being made without factoring what is more of a eventuality than a possibility at this point.” The Air Force could use the money saved by unloading a portion of their tanking mission to private contractors to invest in building new tankers faster, and at lower cost, to replace aging ones. Retired KC-10s and KC-135s could find new life in the hands of contractors. Unloading a portion of the tanking mission is not just about having less planes to sustain. It also means that USAF pilots, who are in short supply, can be sent to fly other airframes and large swathes of existing infrastructure can be sold off or leased to private operators. In other words, if there is any mission where private contractors can help the DoD’s air forces, and especially the USAF, it is this one. Hopefully more companies like Tempus will come forward to take the risk—certainly others have tried and failed —but if the USAF could come to terms with the idea, it could really get the concept going on a grand scale. This would allow for stiff competition among multiple providers. As a result, lower prices and increase quality of service could be realized. The best part about such a plan is that the USAF could still keep its tanking mission, just with a more modern and potent, albeit smaller tanker fleet. We will keep you informed as to the progress of the deal, but hopefully we will see a trio of reinvigorated Tristars plowing the skies over the US soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 4, 2018",Is This China’s DF-21D Air Launched Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile Toting Bomber?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have surfaced from China’s internet supposedly showing a new derivative of the People’s Liberation Air Force’s Xian H-6 bomber. This incarnation of the H-6, dubbed the H-6N, is designed to carry one weapon in particular—the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile. The base H-6 is itself a derivative of the Tu-16 Badger, a Soviet designed aircraft from the dawn of jet age that took its first flight 65 years ago. China started building the Tu-16 under license as the H-6 in 1959. Since then the country has evolved the H-6 design somewhat radically, using new building materials and techniques, advanced avionics and updated turbofan engines to persistently modernize what is a relatively ancient design. China has also adapted the H-6 for a huge variety of roles, including reconnaissance, electronic warfare, aerial refueling, and a wide array of testbed duties, in addition to its role as a bomber and cruise missile carrier. Now the H-6N, the latest variant of the most modern H-6 version, the H-6K bomber, will supposedly take on one of the most exotic roles of all—hauling anti-ship ballistic missiles to launching points far from Chinese shores. China’s DF-21D remains a somewhat shadowy weapon when it comes to its true abilities. Nevertheless it is now widely regarded as a game-changing anti-access/area-denial weapon system. The DF-21D is a conventionally armed, ground-launched medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), with a range thought to be around 800 to 900 miles. How it differs from standard MRBMs is that it can maneuver dynamically during reentry and has the ability to target large vessels during the terminal phase of its flight. In essence, it is a carrier killer that engages at hypersonic speeds and steep angles of descent, making most traditional defensive weaponry useless against it. Even advanced anti-ballistic missile capabilities would be hard pressed to intercept a DF-21D depending on its stage of flight. Road mobile DF-21Ds being paraded through Tiananmen Square., AP The DF-21D seems like an amazing weapon system—one that could help keep US carrier strike groups far enough from Chinese shores to make their fighter aircraft and cruise useless. But the system is only as good as the targeting information provided to it. The DF-21D’s ability to track and engage its target is limited to its terminal attack phase via the use of radar and possibly infrared sensors installed aboard its reentry vehicle. Initial targeting and mid-course updates are supplied by external sources and data-linked to the launching platform just before flight and possibly to the missile during its midcourse phase of flight. Back in 2010, when the DF-21D supposedly became operational, China’s ability to target vessels far out to sea in the great watery expanses of the Pacific was limited. I wrote about this stark reality in 2011 . Today the country’s surveillance capabilities in space, on the ground, in the air, at sea, and under the sea have improved substantially. Any one or a combination of these sensors, which includes everything from ground based over-the-horizon radar, to surveillance satellites, to high altitude and long endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft, can provide the targeting data that can get the DF-21D in the right area for executing its deadly terminal attack on a ship. With maturing and diversified sensor and hardened long-range communications networks beginning to coalesce, China may be more limited by the DF-21D’s range than by the ability to target ships far from Chinese shores. The Chinese military seems to be attacking this issue in two key ways beyond the fielding of more capable nuclear fast attack submarines. First is the supposed development of an anti-ship variant of the DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM). The standard land attack DF-26 missile is nicknamed the “Guam Killer’ because it would be used to barrage the American island stronghold and other US bases in the region during a conflict. It sports a range of roughly 2,000 to 2,500 miles. So an anti-ship variant of the DF-26 would likely have over double the range of the DF-21D. It still isn’t clear what the operational status is of the anti-ship variant of the DF-26, but it is clearly an ongoing program for the Chinese military. Seeing that the DF-26 anti-ship missile concept would not be feasible without robust long-range naval targeting capabilities, its very existence is an indication that China has progressed significantly in this area over the last seven years or so. The other way China can extend its anti-ship ballistic missile capability is to take the DF-21D and deliver it to launch points far out to sea via aircraft. Although having heavy aircraft launch ballistic missiles is not common, it is not unprecedented. The idea was toyed with during the Cold War and today C-17s drop ballistic missiles as targets for anti-ballistic missile tests. Still, there are no operational combat systems that do this, but then again the job of creating a giant anti-access bubble around one’s country and attacking ships with ballistic missiles is somewhat different than using the technique to launch traditional nuclear-tipped ballistic weapons. This is supposedly the job of China’s newest derivative of the H-6, the H-6N—to haul an air-launched version of the DF-21D out towards the existing edges of China’s anti-access bubble and put enemy ships at risk nearly a thousand more miles out from that point. The H-6N also clearly features an aerial refueling probe, which can extend its range dramatically when paired with China’s IL-76/78 tankers or even older HY-6 tankers. The H-6N will carry the DF-21D ventrally., Chinese Internet The ground-launched DF-21D weights roughly 32,000lbs. It isn’t clear if the H-6N will be able to lug that much weight on a single hardpoint, but it is possible, if not probable, that the air-launched version of the DF-21D will be lighter due to not needing to climb the first 30,000 plus feet during its boost phase. If the H-6N can haul the same weapon configuration as the ground-launched DF-21D then it will be have substantially more range due to its higher launch altitude. The H-6N may also be able to launch other rocket systems, which could put small satellites in orbit or even carry anti-satellite payloads into low earth orbit. China has had a high interest in this capability as of late and utilizing the H-6N for the lower-end of the air-launch rocket concept would make a lot of sense. HY-6 is a aerial refueling variant of the H-6 bomber. , Li Pang/Wikicommons It is likely that the H-6N will also be able to carry anti-ship cruise missiles as it appears to have pylons to do so. It looks to also carry a large radar in its nose, which would allow for organic targeting for its cruise missiles during closer-range anti-ship engagements. Regardless of if the aircraft photographed does indeed end up toting around an air-launched version of the DF-21D or not, the concept is in development, and it definitely represents an unprecedented conventional anti-ship threat, especially to American carrier and amphibious strike groups. If an anti-ship variant of the DF-26 can reach out at least 2,000 miles, and the air-launched DF-21D can reach out roughly another 1,000 miles farther from that threat horizon, in total the two systems combined could provide a continuous anti-ship ballistic missile umbrella reaching out over 3,000 miles from Chinese shores. Above all else the H-6N is an indication of China’s maturing anti-access/area-denial umbrella and all the infrastructure that goes along with. It will also make China’s anti-ship ballistic missile arsenal more survivable, as with the H-6N in inventory, DF-21D missiles can be conveyed from anywhere in the country out over the ocean for launch.

During a “colorful” encounter with sailors from the USS Kentucky (SSBN-737), he said a number of things, including telling sailors they are not “some pussy sitting on the sidelines,” stating : “You’ll still miss it. You’ll miss it like the dickens, and you’ll be changed for the better for the rest of your life. So you’ll never regret, but you will have some of the best days of your life and some of the worst days of your life in the U.S. Navy, you know what I mean? That says — that means you’re living. That means you’re living. That means you’re not some pussy sitting on the sidelines, you know what I mean, kind of sitting there saying, “Well, I should have done something with my life.” Because of what you’re doing now, you’re not going to be laying on a shrink’s couch when you’re 45 years old, say “What the hell did I do with my life?” Why? Because you served others; you served something bigger than you.” After his address to the sailors he took a few questions, one of which he elaborated on extensively and his answer could have huge strategic impact on the future of America’s nuclear arsenal. A review is currently underway examining America’s nuclear weapons posture. It includes an evaluation of the continuing need for a nuclear triad . America’s Cold War vintage nuclear posture still includes bombers, ballistic missile submarines, and ground based intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is hugely expensive to maintain and upgrade, leading to debate over the possibility of reducing the nuclear triad to a dyad, something The War Zone has advocated exploring in the past. SecDef Mattis talks to submariners at Naval Base Kitsap., DoD The exchange started when a sailor asked “do we expect to maintain all three legs of the nuclear triad, sir?” Here’s Mattis’s response: “Yes, that’s a great question. Now, are we going to maintain all three legs of the triad? You know you’re the most survivable. So long as you can run this boat quietly, you’ll stay survivable. Then of course we’ve got the bombers, and we need the bombers because they address a different target set, and they give us a different mode of command and control. And then we’ve got the ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles). Now coming into the job I’ve been three years out of the Marines. I was the infantry for a long time, and I had time — when I was living down at a university, down at Stanford University south of here, and I studied this, and I had a lot of questions. I believe as I got done with each of the three legs, yours is sacrosanct. You and your mission, that you know, and it’s because of how good you are. If we didn’t have control over the Naval reactors, you didn’t — weren’t able to run those right, if we had a lack of managerial integrity — you and I call it small-unit discipline, if we didn’t have that, it wouldn’t be the same thing. But I can look you in the eye and tell you, that nothing is more certain than if you have a sailor son of yours going to the Navy one day, he could very well be doing the same thing if he falls in his father’s footsteps. You’ll be here. Bombers will still be here. We’ve got to give them some standoff capability. We got that. They’ll be there. The ICBMs, because an enemy would have to shoot so much to take them out, you know because their dug in underground, it’s going to soak up a lot. I think we’re going to keep all three legs of the deterrent. However, we’ve got a review going on right now. I’ve got the smartest people I can find. And it’s Republican and Democrat. It’s men and women. It’s old people. It’s young physicists. It’s people who studied history. There are people who know what they’re doing. And then I brought in a whole bunch of old Navy admirals who’ve gone through your program, and people like that, Air Force generals, and they’re going to review what those smart people are doing. And when we get done we’ll have a good posture set for us. And it really goes back why we need you, answering the first — the lieutenant’s question.  And I think we need the other two legs.  But I’ve got to wait until the posture review is done. But you’re safe in terms of your job — you’ll have a job even if you stick around in the Navy, 29, 30 years, OK? And for those of us who went for 40, we were just slow learners, all right. (Laughter)” Mattis meets with commanders at Naval Base Kitsap., DoD The discussion offered an incredibly raw look at how Mattis personally views the issue—one that could result in one of the most high-stakes national security decisions of our time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia May Be Testing Its GPS Spoofing Capabilities Around The Black Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A consensus is building that Russia has been experimenting with the ability to override Global Positioning System signals with fake ones that can severely disrupt and confuse the geolocation abilities of GPS users. For now this phenomenon has mainly affected ships traversing the Black Sea, but during a time of conflict it could impact a wide spectrum of combat systems including drones, missiles, smart bombs, as well as surface combatants and land warfare units. Even manned aircraft may not be immune to such electronic warfare tactics. This all started on June 22nd when a ship near the Russian port of Novorossiysk reported a major miscalculation with their high-end GPS installation. New Scientist states: “On 22 June, the US Maritime Administration filed a seemingly bland incident report. The master of a ship off the Russian port of Novorossiysk had discovered his GPS put him in the wrong spot – more than 32 kilometers inland, at Gelendzhik Airport. After checking the navigation equipment was working properly, the captain contacted other nearby ships. Their AIS traces – signals from the automatic identification system used to track vessels – placed them all at the same airport. At least 20 ships were affected . While the incident is not yet confirmed, experts think this is the first documented use of GPS misdirection – a spoofing attack that has long been warned of but never been seen in the wild.” Maritime-executive.com has a more thorough account of the incident you can read here. The commander of the ship that reported the strange occurrence documented it thoroughly. Russia’s large port at Novorossiysk sits at the northern end of the tense Black Sea region, near the Kerch Strait and across from Russian-held Crimea. Novorossiysk is a major port for Russia Black Sea Fleet. , Google Maps As New Scientist points out, GPS spoofing seems to be something Russia has been playing with in a major way before this anomaly occurred in the northern Black Sea region. Reports that GPS users around Moscow, and especially near the Kremlin, have had similar issues, with the peculiar GPS behavior being discovered in a most unusual way: “Over the past year, GPS spoofing has been causing chaos for the receivers on phone apps in central Moscow to misbehave . The scale of the problem did not become apparent until people began trying to play Pokemon Go. The fake signal, which seems to centre on the Kremlin, relocates anyone nearby to Vnukovo Airport , 32 km away. This is probably for defensive reasons; many NATO guided bombs, missiles and drones rely on GPS navigation, and successful spoofing would make it impossible for them to hit their targets.” Insidegnss.com elaborates further on Russia’s affinity for GPS denial tactics: “With more than 250,000 cell towers in Russia equipped with GPS jamming devices as a defense against attack by U.S. missiles, the country has advanced capabilities to disrupt GPS. There have been press reports of Russian GPS jamming in both Moscow and the Ukraine. In fact Russia has boasted that its capabilities “make aircraft carriers useless,” and the U.S. Director of National Intelligence recently issued a report that stated that Russia and others were focusing on improving their capability to jam U.S. satellite systems, according to the RNT Foundation.” GPS jamming, or the loss of GPS altogether, has long been a major concern of the US military. One highly publicized yet at the same time shadowy drill led to warnings that GPS blackouts and disruptions would emanate from the Mojave Desert and reach hundreds of miles in every direction. Other elaborate testing and systems development programs have increased in frequency and scope regarding operating in GPS denied environments. This includes a cocktail of new technologies that can offer similar geolocation capabilities to GPS without the need for a constellation of satellites above. Still, wide-area GPS jamming or outages are easy to detect, but spoofing GPS signals is a much more insidious threat, especially if spoofing effects are localized in nature. New Scientist states: “…It can now be done with commercial hardware and software downloaded from the Internet. Nor does it require much power. Satellite signals are very weak – about 20 watts from 20,000 miles away – so a one-watt transmitter on a hilltop, plane or drone is enough to spoof everything out to the horizon.” Advanced guidance and navigation systems, like those found on aircraft and in most GPS-guided weapons, use inertial navigation with embedded GPS . System software loaded onto the INS/GPS guidance system uses algorithms to detect discrepancies among various steams of information. This way the system can place less priority on one stream of information, say from a malfunctioning ring-laser gyro or GPS receiver, than others. Or it can discount that steam entirely if it starts straying far from the consensus of the others. This way a navigation system that suddenly loses a component due to failure or has one of its data streams deviate for other reasons won’t simply stop working. For instance, if the GPS telemetry suddenly leaps miles away, the navigation system may “vote out” the GPS information entirely. The system will be less accurate overall because of it, but it will still function. As an example, take a Joint Direct Attack Munition, the most common guided bomb used by the USAF, which uses GPS and INS navigation. If the system suddenly loses GPS connectivity during its attack sequence, INS will take over, but the bomb will be substantially less accurate than it would have been with both GPS and INS working together as a team. JDAM has a tailkit with moving fins, a GPS antenna and a GPS/INS autopilot. , Boeing But spoofing isn’t as simple as telling a GPS receiver it is somewhere totally different than where it really is. By broadcasting false GPS data that slowly changes over time, navigational systems with GPS and INS may not “throw out” the GPS data so soon, or at all for that matter. Over time this could result in vehicles going far off course or even running into shores, mountains or even other vehicles without warning. Some say this is how the Iranians brought down the RQ-170 Sentinel drone in a relatively intact state in late November 2011, although this remains highly debatable. As for what emitter or platform that may have caused the disruption, we don’t know for sure. But it is interesting to note that a Tu-214SR strategic communications relay aircraft was deployed to Crimea shortly before the incident took place, and has been flying regular circles over the northern Black Sea ever since. It’s possible the aircraft is capable of rebroadcasting fake GPS signals aside from its primary duties, or at least is experimenting with the capability in region. As you can see, this new form of electronic warfare is powerful and potentially quite deadly. The big question is how or when would Russia use it as a weapon? It seems that it fits well into Moscow’s hybrid warfare playbook, as it could disrupt the navigation of unfriendly forces and even impact their ability to target Russian forces. It could also disrupt commerce and air travel all while the hostile emitter stays safely in Russian territory. On a peer state warfare level, such as in a conflict against NATO, this technology could not only protect Russian forces from kinetic attacks by weapons that use GPS, but it could also disrupt any allied operations that relies heavily on GPS for navigation today. Even logistics to support such an operation could also be negatively affected. Basically, the US military, and much of the world’s transportation and commerce, runs on GPS. If anything else this incident in the Black Sea is a stark reminder of why the Pentagon needs to wean itself off this dependency as soon as possible. This possible event also doesn’t take into account other avenues of attack a foreign power has to disrupt the GPS network, which includes cyber-intrusion or even attacking GPS satellites directly. Anti-satellite capabilities have become far more exotic, hard to detect, and more numerous than they once were. And even electronic warfare targeting GPS satellites doesn’t have to be terrestrial in origin. Jamming tactics can be deployed in space between orbiting objects. Among all this uncertainty, one thing is for sure—during a major conflict, GPS will be a prime strategic target. Considering the technology to disrupt or spoof its signals is becoming ever more accessible, non-state actors will likely take advantage of it too for nefarious purposes. For instance, just think of this tactic’s implications when it comes to a concept like self-driving cars. With all this in mind, preparing for a world where GPS connectivity is not guaranteed may not be convent but it may be entirely necessary.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Navy Releases Harrowing Report On Fitzgerald Collision, Begins Punishing Sailors","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As multiple investigations into the USS Fitzgerald’s collision with the freighter ACX Crystal last June grind on, more heads are beginning to roll, including those of the destroyer’s top leadership. Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Bill Moran told reporters that the Fitzgerald’s CO, XO and Master Chief Petty Officer would be relieved because the Navy had “lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead.” This is a strong indication that negligence on the crew of the Fizgerald’s behalf likely was the leading factor in the tragic collision that resulted in seven dead sailors, multiple wounded, and one badly damaged Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Admiral Moran went on to add that roughly a dozen of the Fitzgerald’s crew will be removed from duty. This announcement coincides with the release of documents detailing a preliminary inquiry into what occurred following the collision, which you can read for yourself here . The report gives us the most complete account of the incident as of yet and it offers images of the ship’s badly damaged interior spaces (see below), some of which sailors had to escape from as water was rapidly rushing in. After reading this report one thing is certain, there were some real heroes in those flooding and badly damaged spaces that night. The cover letter summary of the report from Rear Admiral C.F. Williams, Commander Carrier Strike Group Five, states in part: “My review of the additional findings confirmed my original determination that the injuries to the three surviving service members, and the deaths of seven Sailors, occurred in the line of duty and not due to misconduct… The Sailors assigned to Berthing 2 should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced. They did what is expected of Sailors in such a situation: they checked racks to ensure everyone was awake; they formed calm lines to egress the space on the port side, away from the flooding; and they filed out of the Berthing in an orderly fashion, assisting one another to the ladder. Two Sailors chose to remain at the bottom of the ladder on the port side of the compartment, and then on top of the hatch after they egressesed, in order to help others out of the space even as the water was rising and began flooding into the space around them. The choices made by these two Sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates. After the collision, FITZGERALD Sailors responded to the myriad damage control scenarios occurring throughout the ship. Flooding, structural damage, and reports of white smoke stressed the damage control organization; at the same time, efforts to restore power, propulsion, steering and navigation continued. The crew of the FITZGERALD fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship. Ultimately, those damage control efforts and restoration processes succeeded in safely bringing FITZGERALD into port under her own power. Through their swift and, in many cases, heroic actions, members of the FITZGERALD crew saved lives. No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation. In spite of the fact that the Berthing was never completely secured, seven Sailors were unable to egress the space. The loss of seven shipmates is a tragedy beyond words and a reminder of the dangers inherent in the mission of every ship and Sailor. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends… We continue to care for both the ship and her crew as they begin the rebuilding process. No one could have foreseen the challenges FITZGERALD would face, but the courage and strength shown by her crew, even as they mourn the loss of seven shipmates, underscore the essence of Navy’s core values.” The report details the minutes following the crash and the incredible things well-trained sailors did to save their fellow shipmates and to save the ship itself. The events concerning Berthing Room 2 are especially harrowing: “Of the 42 Sailors assigned to Berthing 2, at the time of collision, five were on watch and two were not aboard. Of the 35 remaining Sailors in Berthing 2, 28 escaped the flooding. Seven Sailors perished. Some of the Sailors who survived the flooding in Berthing 2 described a loud noise at the time of impact. Other Berthing 2 Sailors felt an unusual movement of the ship or were thrown from their racks. Still other Berthing 2 Sailors did not realize what had happened and remained in their racks. Some of them remained asleep. Some Sailors reported hearing alarms after the collision, while others remember hearing nothing at all. 23. Seconds after impact, Sailors in Berthing 2 started yelling “water on deck!” and “get out!” One Sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water. Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one Sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up. Senior Sailors checked for others that might still be in their racks. The occupants of Berthing 2 described a rapidly flooding space, estimating later that the space was nearly flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds. By the time the third Sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep. Debris, including mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle, and wall lockers, floated into the aisles between racks in Berthing 2, impeding Sailors’ ability to get down from their racks and their ability to exit the space. The ship’s 5 to 7 degree list to starboard increased the difficulty for Sailors crossing the space from the starboard side to the port side. Many of the Sailors recall that the battle lanterns were illuminated. Battle lanterns turn on when power to an electrical circuit is out or when turned on manually. Sailors recall that after the initial shock, occupants lined up in a relatively calm and orderly manner to climb the port side ladder and exit through the port side watertight scuttle… They moved along the blue floor and turned left at the end to access the ladder. Even though the Sailors were up to their necks in water by that point, they moved forward slowly and assisted each other. One Sailor reported that FC1 Rehm pushed him out from under a falling locker. Two of the Sailors who already escaped from the main part of Berthing 2 stayed at the bottom of the ladder well in order to help their shipmates out of the berthing area. The door to the Berthing 2 head (bathrooms and showers) was open and the flooding water dragged at least one person into this area. Exiting from the head during this flood of water was difficult and required climbing over debris. As the last group of Sailors to escape through the port side watertight scuttle arrived at the bottom of the ladder, the water was up to their necks. The two Sailors who had been helping people from the bottom of the ladder were eventually forced to climb the ladder as water reached the very top of the Berthing 2 compartment. They continued to assist their shipmates as they climbed, but were eventually forced by the rising water to leave Berthing 2 through the watertight scuttle themselves. Before climbing the ladder, they looked through the water and did not see any other Sailors. Once through the watertight scuttle and completely out of the Berthing 2 space (on the landing outside Berthing 1) they continued to search, reaching into the dark water to try to find anyone they could. From the top of the ladder, these two Sailors were able to pull two other Sailors from the flooded compartment. Both of the rescued Sailors were completely underwater when they were pulled to safety. The last Sailor to be pulled from Berthing 2 was in the bathroom at the time of the collision and a flood of water knocked him to the deck. Lockers were floating past him and he scrambled across them towards the main berthing area. At one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free. He made his way to the only light he could see, which was coming from the port side watertight scuttle. He was swimming towards the watertight scuttle when he was pulled from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.” USN USN Report How the Captain was rescued was quite amazing as well, with the report reading: “The CO was in his cabin at the time of the collision. The CRYSTAL’s bow directly struck his cabin, located above the waterline. The impact severely damaged his cabin, trapping him inside. The CO called the bridge requesting assistance. Five Sailors used a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies to break through the door into the CO’s cabin, remove the hinges, and then pry the door open enough to squeeze through. Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily. A junior officer and two chief petty officers removed debris from in front of the door and crawled into the cabin. The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel. The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship. The team took the CO to the bridge, where a medical team assessed his condition. As he was being monitored by personnel on the bridge, his condition worsened. A team of stretcher bearers moved the CO from the bridge to the at-sea cabin at 0319, and shortly thereafter, due to the severity of his injuries, he was medically evacuated from the ship at 0710 to USNHY via helicopter. He was treated and released on 18 June 2017.” USN Report The report goes on to detail damage control effort and the ship’s voyage back to port, along with in-port recovery efforts. It doesn’t talk to the cause of the crash or the events leading up to it, but a few details are mentioned that may be of interest. Here is the official geometry of the crash: USN report The report also states the following details about the ship’s condition before and following the impact: “The seas were relatively calm at 2 to4 feet. The sky was dark, the moon was relatively bright, and there was scattered cloud cover and unrestricted visibility. FITZGERALD was operating in a standard condition for deployed ships steaming at night, including being at “darkened ship,” meaning that all exterior lighting was off except for the navigation lights, and all interior lighting was switched to red instead of white light. The damage control posture of the ship was “Modified ZEBRA,”meaning that all doors inside the ship, and all hatches (openings located on the floor between decks) at the main deck and below were shut in order to help secure the boundaries between different areas of the ship in case of flooding or fire. Watertight scuttles on the hatches (smaller openings that can be opened or closed independently of the hatch) were left open in order to allow easy transit between spaces. These conditions were the normal state of the ship at that hour as required by international navigation rules of the road, and by procedures established for all U.S. Navy surface ships. The impact at the moment of collision caused FITZGERALD to list (tilt) a reported 14 degrees to port. FITZGERALD then settled into a 7 degree starboard list as the sea flooded into Berthing 2 through the starboard access trunk and weighted the ship deeper into the water on the starboard side. The collision resulted in a loss of external communications and a loss of power in the forward portion of the ship. Following the collision, FITZGERALD changed her lighting configuration at the mast to one red light over another red light, known as “red over red,” the international lighting scheme that indicates a ship that is “not under command.” Under international navigation rules of the road, this signifies that, due to an exceptional circumstance such as loss of propulsion or steering, a vessel is unable to maneuver as required.” The report includes a timetable of events, and as you can see, no crash alarm was sounded until after the impact: USN Report Here is a diagram of the external damage to the ship: USN Report The Navy describes the damage as such: “The impact of CRYSTAL’s bulbous bow below the waterline punctured the side of FITZGERALD, creating a hole measuring approximately 13ft by 17ft, spanning the second and third decks below the main deck. The hole allowed water to flow directly into Auxiliary Machinery Room 1 (AUX 1) and the Berthing 2 starboard access trunk. The force of impact from CRYSTAL’s bulbous bow and resulting flood of water pushed the non-water tight door between the starboard access trunk and Berthing 2 inward. The wall supporting this door pulled away from the ceiling and bent to a near-90 degree angle. As a result, nothing separatedBerthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly.” We’ll have to wait for the final investigative finding on the crash itself to get the prologue to the story of what caused this tragic accident, but at least now we have a more complete picture of what occurred following the impact, including some displays of incredible bravery by US Navy sailors.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 2, 2018",U.S. Army’s “Upgunned” Stryker Armored Vehicles Will Soon Be On The Front Lines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two new Stryker armored combat vehicle configurations are being fielded to the U.S. Army and are currently undergoing drills at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. The vehicles are the result of a two year initiative that aims to give the Stryker far more firepower and engagement range. These requirements are primarily based around the Germany-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment’s need to better deter Russia in eastern Europe, and if need be, confront Russian armored fighting vehicles that are equipped with heavier weapons that the .50 caliber machine guns found on most Strykers.  It is also in response to the proliferation of crudely modified civilian trucks that are made to carry powerful weapons such as anti-aircraft guns. Commonly known as “technicals,” these improvised combat vehicles are all too common on the battlefields of Northern Africa and the Middle East. Stryker Dragoon., US Army One of the new Stryker configurations, dubbed the “ Dragoon ” like its 2nd Cavalry Regiment owners, or more formally the Stryker Carrier Vehicle Dragoon, features a 30mm Bushmaster cannon. The design also uses the latest tech from other Stryker models, including the suspension from the “double v” ambush and mine-resistant Stryker’s hull and mature combat system components. It only took 18 months for the program to go from a Powerpoint presentation to where it is today—lightning speed in terms of defense acquisition. $300 million in emergency funding was allocated for the project by Congress in 2015, when Russia’s far more aggressive international posture was still quite new. The Orbital ATK XM813 30X173mm cannon used on the Dragoon is a derivative of the Mk44 Bushmaster II cannon—a highly capable, reliable and versatile weapon. Derivatives of the Mk44 fly on AC-130J gunships and are installed on Littoral Combat Ships and San Antonio class amphibious assault ships, not to mention many other weapon systems applications around the globe. The XM813 can engage targets out to over 9,000 feet, way farther than the Stryker’s standard .50 caliber machine guns, and with much greater impact and lethality. It fires the same ammunition as the A-10 Warthog’s GAU-8 Avenger cannon , but it can also fire programmable air burst rounds, giving it the ability to take out human targets hiding behind barriers and inside window and doorways. It can also use this ammunition to work as a short-range air defense battery against low-flying drones and helicopters. Here is a similar setup in action that is offered for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle: The gun has a variable rate of fire of 100 or 200 rounds per minute and has two magazines with 78 rounds each as well as another 264 rounds stored in the Stryker’s hull. The gun’s unmanned turret is a Kongsberg Protech Systems Medium Caliber Remote Weapons Station. In all the installation adds two tons to the Stryker’s mass but it doesn’t impede the vehicles basic duty—transporting around a nine man squad plus a driver and a gunner. The 30mm cannon is not meant to give the Stryker the ability to take on columns of enemy advanced heavy armor offensively, but it does give Stryker units a far more robust defensive capability against those types of threats. One of the drawbacks of this configuration is reduced visibility because crews can’t simply pop their head out a hatch to see what’s around them as the turret is remotely operated. General Dynamics has tried to mitigate this with a modified view port layout, but commanders already doubt if Dragoon Strykers can lead a formation due to this issue. If anything else, it sounds like the Dragoon is a ripe candidate for a virtual viewing/augmented reality setup to enhance crew situational awareness. But before that’s a possibility, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment will learn how to better fight with remote weapons turrets in a “buttoned up” fashion, and what tactics can be put to use to minimize this disadvantage. The second new Stryker configuration intended for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment as well as all other Stryker units features the CROWS-J remote weapons turret. The Common Remotely Operated Weapon System (CROWS) is already found on many US military fighting vehicles, but this new version features FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles in addition to its machine gun. This gives Stryker crews the ability to employ highly precise and deadly standoff weaponry against everything from troop formations, to helicopters, to heavily armored targets from the safety of their vehicles. Javelins are commonplace in US Army units, including the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, but they are fired from the shoulder using a cumbersome thermal targeting device. CROWS-J allows for that functionality to be integrated into the Stryker itself and at its crew’s fingertips using CROWS advanced optical targeting and surveillance suite. The Stryker mounted Javelins have a range of two miles and can execute indirect “overhead” attacks as well as direct attacks. Many Strykers already have a CROWS installation, so this will be an upgrade to those systems. Currently the Army has budgeted for 83 “Dragoon” 30mm cannon equipped Strykers, all of which are allocated to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and will begin showing up in Germany in January 2018 if everything goes as planned. They will likely find themselves in Eastern Europe soon after their arrival on the continent. If the project turns out to be highly successful, other Stryker units could begin receiving similar modifications, but presently there are no funds set aside to realize such a plan.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",We Chew The Fat About BACN With Program Boss And Airman Who Used It In Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) is a high-flying universal translator and rebroadcasting system of sorts that has provided game-changing effects in challenging war zones like Afghanistan. Yet the relatively tiny BACN aircraft force remains somewhat misunderstood and largely unappreciated. The War Zone aims to change that. We had a wide-ranging and eye-opening discussion with the BACN program’s head honcho over at Hanscom AFB, Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Helfrich, as well as an experienced Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Weapons Officer who has used BACN successfully in combat, Captain Dennis Seay. We learned what BACN really can and can’t do, how its capabilities are applied to real-life combat situations, and where the program is heading in the near future, as well as a ton of other insights into just how valuable this system is to warfighters on the ground and in the air. The Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, better known as BACN: Lt Col Helfrich: BACN is essentially a set of airborne radios and data link terminals that fly on two different aircraft types, but those terminals include SADL—Situational Awareness Data Link—and Link 16. Then for the radios, there’s a UHF as well as SATCOM. Then we also have common data link downlink capability, which is a high bandwidth way to pass information. The whole BACN system is flown airborne on the E-11 aircraft, and then also on the EQ-4B aircraft. A little more about those aircraft is that the E-11 is a commercial derivative aircraft [BD-700 Global Express] that has been modified. Then the EQ-4B is a version of the Global Hawk . The EQ-4B BACN Global Hawk., U.S. Air Force photo/Greg L. Davis A high demand, low density asset: Lt Col Helfrich: We have seven aircraft [four E-11s and three EQ-4Bs] and we’re flying essentially two 24/7 orbits, every day around the clock. Last year alone, we flew 21,000 combat flight hours over 1,500 combat missions and supported about 7,000 combat strikes in theater. That was just last year. On the E-11 side, first off we have very good maintainers that keep the aircraft up and flying. The BD-700—the E-11s—have been a good platform for us, but we average about eight times as much [flight time] as other non-military BD-700s. It’s been a very good platform, but we’ve definitely pushed it, or we’ve been the fleet leader with the E-11s. E-11 Global Express BACN aircraft., Photo by Capt. Keenan Kunst The Global Hawk, again, we have tremendous maintainers on the ground keeping those flying. Another point, we have those three EQ-4Bs, and with just those three aircraft, we fly over half of all Global Hawk flight hours. We work hand in hand with the Global Hawk program office because they are an integral part of BACN being successful. We talk to them all the time. I talk to my counterpart there routinely. Capability differences between the E-11 and EQ-4B BACN platforms: Lt Col Helfrich: I don’t want to get in exact specifics, but the flight time for the Global Hawks is significantly longer than the Global Expresses, which allows you more on-orbit time with the Global Hawks. Additionally, the Global Hawks fly their orbits at higher altitudes.The E-11s still fly at very high altitude as well. Now, that’s really the differences in the airframe. The interesting thing to note is when it comes to the payload, they’re almost identical between the two platforms. The E-11A that has a “canoe” on the bottom and a “teardrop” on the top is aircraft tail #9001, which is affectionately referred to as “Snowball.” 9001 was the first E-11A fielded with the BACN payload, and it was also the BD-700 test aircraft. The “canoe” and “teardrop” do not contain any additional equipment or provide any additional capability, they are left over from previous flight test efforts. BACN’s genesis and NASA’s WB-57 Canberra High Altitude Research Aircraft: Lt Col Helfrich: The WB-57 was first deployed in 2008. There were 50 operational missions flown in Afghanistan with the WB-57. It’s now used basically as a test platform, because the E-11A, EQ-4B aircraft and BACN are so highly in demand that we can’t pull aircraft out of theatre to do the testing of the upgrades or modifications to the system. We use the WB-57 as a surrogate for platforms that provide BACN in theatre. WB-57 BACN testbed while transiting through Rota, Spain., Petty Officer 2nd Class Travis Alston How BACN differs from other airborne communications “gateways” such as the ROBE system that can be installed on the KC-135R: Lt Col Helfrich: In general, the different systems that are out there are complementary. I’m not the expert on ROBE , but I can tell you it is what you would call an opportunistic capability because it does fly on the KC-135s, and their primary mission is air refueling. The BACN is a dedicated asset. How they’re used is quite a bit different. The modular Roll-On Beyond Line of Sight Enhancement system that can be deployed aboard KC-135s provides data link translator capabilities and range extension for data link networks, but does not have the flexibility or communications gateway capabilities of BACN., Staff Sgt. Nathan Gallahan) The so called “Einstein Box” gateway being tested on the U-2S Dragon Lady and BACN: That’s an area that I’m not an expert on. What I can tell you is that that was flown as a demonstration. As far as I’m aware, there’s no plans to operationally use the U-2s as a gateway. Possible future BACN platforms: Lt Col Helfrich: We’ve considered several different platforms, and several were considered before we landed on the E-11 and the Global Hawk. None have been more fully fleshed out because the BACN modification is pretty extensive. As you would expect with so much communications gear, there are lots of antennas and apertures, which require modification to the aircraft. Basically, at this time the E-11 and EQ-4, that is the way. If you’re going to add more, that’s probably where they’re going to be added, in those types of platforms. Currently, we’re not looking at any platforms other than the E-11 and the EQ-4B. BACN over the battlefield: Captain Dennis Seay: From the TACP [Tactical Air Control Party] and JTAC [Joint Terminal Attack Controller] perspective our responsibility is to direct air power or direct close air support onto targets. With that, me being on the ground probably the main thing or the most important thing to me is communication. Not only with the aircraft that are attached to me, but with my headquarters or operations center. What BACN does overhead for me is it allows me more opportunities or more available options to talk to both of those people. Number one, with terrain issues in Afghanistan, sometimes it could be hard talking to airplanes that are 10 or 15 miles away. Depending on where you are, it could be much closer, so I have much more limited range. Joint Terminal Attack Controllers are modern day Forward Air Controllers that can call in a wide array of firepower often times while under fire. , Senior Airman Kevin Tanenbaum With BACN, their capabilities, it allows me to use them as a “retrans.” Essentially, I talk on my radio, BACN automatically retrans it, and it extends my line-of-sight communications to the aircraft or to the operations center that I’m responsible to. Number one for me is it increases my ability to talk long range. Number two is time. Time if often essential for me and to set up a satellite antenna to talk back to the operations center is difficult sometimes. It takes time. Sometimes I don’t have that, say, five minutes that it takes to set up an antenna. Instead of me stopping and setting up that antenna, if I have a BACN bridge in place, I talk to BACN on a line-of-sight frequency. They do the automatic transmission into, let’s say for instance, a SATCOM frequency or a telephone, and talk back to the operations center without me having to stop and ask the enemy to stop shooting at me. The difference between having and not having BACN overhead: Captain Dennis Seay: I’d say, number one, the biggest difference is knowing that they’re there. I don’t think that our community on the JTAC side is as educated as we should be to know what BACN can do and when it’s available. By knowing what BACN can do, during my last appointment for example, we were able to solve quite a bit of problems. I’d say the majority of the problems for the JTAC or the guy on the ground has to do with range and communication. With something that can increase my range dramatically, and allow me to communicate, my life is much easier no matter what. If they can take that problem off the table, then I think the limits are boundless. As far as when I get into a situation where I need to save people or if I need to strike this target, if I don’t have communications, we’re in trouble. Having this in place, if it can help or I don’t want to say guarantee, by if it could improve my comms capability, my life and my job just got way better. One of many times when BACN solved a major battlefield communications problem: Captain Dennis Seay: My last deployment was early last year, so February of ’16, and F-16s were there. I was the wing’s weapons officer at Bagram . The F-16s were the primary fixed wing strike platform in the country. One of the problems when I first got there as the wings weapons officer was to try to figure out why the F-16 wasn’t employing or wasn’t involved as much as they should be, given their capability and all the things we know the F-16 can do. One of the root causes we got down to was communication. Communication, again, once we dug into it and tried to figure out what they were doing, the F-16s were primarily using SATCOM due to range restrictions and the terrain in Afghanistan. They were using SATCOM to talk back to the operations center, which is exactly what they should be doing. It was the right decision to use that frequency or that band. But when they’re in certain positions, certain banks, certain turns impeding antenna position, it was hurting their SATCOM transmission. A lot of times during strikes, they were not able to talk. F-16CJ high over Afghanistan. , Staff Sgt. Matthew B. Fredericks At that point, we tried to figure out what we could do to fix it. Again, we made some contacts and talked to the BACN guys that were in Afghanistan, and ended up getting down to what can we do to get these F-16s to better employ. One of things was to employ BACN and use the UHF frequencies from the F-16 to allow line-of-sight, which worked great because their antenna placements are way better. They have multiple antenna ports, so it allowed the F-16 to output UHF on line-of-sight frequencies. Then the BACN would take it in, and translate it to whatever output we wanted. For a couple of examples, we outputted to UHF if the line-of-sight frequencies worked. We took BACN and translated it to a phone. Actually, they were in the operations center talking to the F-16s on the phone via the F-16’s UHF upload into BACN. We solved it a number of ways, but I think without BACN, we’d still be running into the SATCOM/UHF problem or the line-of-sight problems, the unique problems that Afghanistan promotes or produces with its terrain and range restrictions. A fighter’s speed and local high terrain can cause major ground to air communication issues without BACN: They’re moving fast, so the windows to give clearance are shorter than they are with a slower aircraft. The speed of the aircraft amplifies the lack of communications a little bit. Otherwise, it was a simple communication problem that once we solved, F-16s were doing well after that. BACN eliminated a lot of frustrations. It allowed us to basically employ more and to allow the F-16s to get involved more, for sure. One of the times when BACN could have solved major battlefield communications problems if it were overhead: Captain Dennis Seay: I used BACN successfully on my last deployment, but a couple of deployments ago when we were departing Iraq—it was the last combat patrol out of Iraq. The tactical problem was getting thousands of vehicles from Baghdad back to Kuwait. How did we do that? We spent a couple of weeks trying to figure this thing out. Problem was communication. Problem was range. Problem was coverage, and end result, it came out to be a very heavy lift with a lot of risk involved. At the brigade level, I had a number of JTACs. The total I used for this mission was six or seven. Let’s call it six. I had to place six JTACs throughout different bases from Baghdad all the way to Kuwait that would basically hand off these series of convoys as they traveled from north to south. The JTACs had to travel there, get in place, figure out the area of operations where they were, do all the terrain mapping and terrain analysis, and cover convoys as they moved through their battlespace. JTACs give an A-10 a visual thanks during training., Senior Airman Kevin Tanenbaum Now, I think what I know about BACN as of the past couple of years, if I did have BACN, and if I did have an orbit above those convoys, I would have been able to cover them with much less effort. I don’t want to say keep them safer because we did a good job getting them out, but it would have decreased the amount of effort and the amount of risk as we moved the Army from Baghdad to Kuwait. It would have ended up being less JTACs on the ground for sure. It would have been less travel and risk of moving helicopters and moving JTACs around. It would have been less aircraft because I had to have aircraft talking to JTACs just in case things happened. If I had had BACN overhead as a relay, it would have helped that as well. How a fighter pilot’s “picture” of the battlespace and general situational awareness changes when BACN is present: Lt Col Helfrich: BACN really does two functions. One really has to do with voice communications and Captain Seay has some great examples of that, and the other one is having to do with data link interoperability. Older F-16s have what’s called SADL [Situational Awareness Data Link], and newer F-16s and many other aircraft have Link 16. BACN has the ability to basically automatically translate between the two data link systems and between those networks. We can push all the information from an A-10 or an older F-16 that has SADL, and push it to an F-15 or a newer F-16 or even an F-18, making sure that they have the largest amount of data for the situation they’re entering. Captain Dennis Seay: As part of the data link communications it also does range extension and unification. Essentially a unification of networks… You can push out and receive that information before you even enter the battle space. You’ll receive not only a more complete data picture, but you receive it earlier to prepare you for your operation. Lt Col Helfrich: If the information is going to Link 16 or SADL, it can be range extended or it can be translated. It doesn’t necessarily matter what platform is pushing information to that network. Link 16 information is primarily displayed on a situational display in an aircraft’s cockpit, in some cases the info can also be displayed in a pilot’s helmet mounted display. An active net provided by BACN not only offers far better transmission coverage but also provides “fused” information from other platforms using different data link modems and waveforms, like SADL. , BAE Systems (Authors note: basically the system collects disparate data link waveform transmissions, such as SADL and Link 16, and then fuses all the information into a common picture and rebroadcasts it out to all those assets in their unique waveforms. Think of it as a flying universal translator for tactical data link systems. This allows for various weapons systems (fighters, sensor aircraft, ships, and even ground systems) with different data links to see a common tactical “picture” at the same time instead of just seeing information from systems with their same type of data link terminal installed and that are within line of sight. Because of its high operating altitude station, BACN also creates an “active net” over the battlefield that can connect forces beyond line of site. For instance, with BACN airborne, a fighter aircraft will likely remain connected via data link even when they are at low altitude and outside line of sight of other similar data link equipped platforms. It also extends the range of data link networks over large swathes of the battlefield.) BACN’s ability to connect 4th generations fighters with 5th generation fighters and other stealth assets that use proprietary data links, like the F-35’s stealthy MADL data link system: Lt Col Helfrich: Currently, BACN doesn’t have the right type of radios to communicate, or the data link terminals, to communicate with the fifth-gen aircraft. Theoretically, there would be a lot of synergy there by having a fifth-generation to fourth-generation gateway on BACN, but there has not been a requirement to date that’s been validated for us to go do that. Similar to MADL, we don’t have a terminal onboard BACN now that would communicate with the F-22’s data link. Again, you could see why theoretically there might be some synergy there with our gateway and that kind of gateway. The first E-11A, affectionally referred to as “Snowball” due to its dorsal SATCOM dome and ventral “canoe” enclosure, gets airborne for another mission over Afghanistan., U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Katherine Spessa The need for more BACN aircraft: Lt Col Helfrich: What I can tell you is the BACN fleet has expanded over the years. It started off with one aircraft, one E-11, and we now have four E-11s and three Block 20 Global Hawks that are equipped with BACN. We are in the middle right now of modifying a fourth Block 20 Global Hawk with BACN. We are expanding the fleet. Captain Dennis Seay: I’ll tell you, from the user perspective, there’s a lot of things. The BACN program is CENTCOM [Central Command] only. It limits our ability to train. It limits our ability to become familiar with this asset, and essentially limits the ability or limits the use that the JTACs will get out of BACN. The same way we’re having trouble with every other piece of equipment that is primarily deployed, if we don’t get a chance to train with it, it won’t be part of our habit pattern. If we’re learning when we get in-country or if we’re trying to figure it out when we get in-country, essentially it’s too late. If the question is, would we like to have it at home to train? The answer from JTAC community as a whole would be a resounding yes. We would love to have it home to train. One of just three EQ-4Bs in the USAF’s inventory seen being towed at an air base in the Middle East., U.S. Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Marie Brown) BACN’s global transmission range: Captain Dennis Seay: It can take whatever frequency in, and send whatever frequency out. SATCOM is an available output for them, so theoretically they can talk worldwide using satellite communication. The system’s ability to retransmit streaming video: Lt Col Helfrich: There is the bandwidth over certain communication forms that we could send video. That has not been a function that we employed on BACN. BACN’s supporting unmanned players flying over the battlefield: Lt Col Helfrich: I would say that we can support and have supported UAVs. I would say the preponderance would be related to close air support. Captain Dennis Seay: I think the point is that BACN is a facilitator for anything Link 16 or SADL. Anything that the Air Force builds that is Link 16 or SADL capable, BACN will be able to improve their capabilities. I think that’s the point. BACN continues to evolve: Lt Col Helfrich: We have a few things that we’re doing right now, the one I’ve already mentioned is the modification of another Global Hawk to make it BACN capable. That will assist with capacity. Additionally, on our E-11s, which are the commercial derivative aircraft, we are working to add IFF [Identification Friend of Foe] capability, as well as eventually moving to a military GPS to make the system more standard for the military. We are transitioning from, if you’re familiar with the MIDS-LVT to the MIDS-JTRS radios, which gives significant increase in capability. Additionally, we are transitioning from the ARC210 gen fours to the generation fives, and then eventually generation six, which again, provides more capability for voice communications. Inside the E-11A’s cockpit., U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Katherine Spessa Captain Dennis Seay: Going to your point about where it’s going in the future, I think BACN is doing what it does with Link 16 and SADL, but on the JTAC or the employment side of things, JTACs in the next year to two years should be a lot better off in a digital-aided CAS [Close Air Support] world. As far as Link 16 radio capable, a program is in place that allows us [JTACs] to get into the Link 16 infrastructure. What that will do for the close air support community is basically put us in there. We’ll see all airplanes in the link, to include your RPAs [Remotely Piloted Vehicles], to include BACN, to include every other Link 16 capable aircraft. It provides over-the-horizon type of communication, so the F-16 that’s coming to support me in a troops-in-contact situation, I can see him when he turns his aircraft onto the runway. As to BACN, will they interact with these people, or will they help? The answer is if they are Link 16 and SADL capable, BACN will help them for sure. That digs in just a little bit to your contested operations environment where we know that voice communications is going to be a problem. When you move to a digital system, I can push a button, and send a nine line , or I can push a button and tell these guys where I am. Like I said earlier, I really have two jobs. I need to keep friendlies safe, and destroy the bad guy, so if I can push a button and tell the F-16, or A-10, or whatever aircraft where I am, and then I could push another button, and he can push another button and see where the enemy is, we’re winning. What a JTAC would like to see in BACN’s future: Captain Dennis Seay: I would say video is especially important now in the COIN [Counter Insurgency] environment where CDE (Collateral Damage Estimation) is such a concern. Video retransmission is a big deal. If it did have video capability, that would be big for the ground fight and the ground user. Otherwise, voice, and then the link or data link architecture is good for us right now. A huge thanks to Lt Col Helfrich and Captain Seay for giving us such a unique insight into BACN and its capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","No, That Satellite Image Going Around Social Media Isn’t Of China’s New Stealth Bomber","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. By most indications, China is in the late stages of a new strategic bomber project. Rumors are swirling that the prototype for the supposedly stealthy flying wing aircraft was rolled out clandestinely in June. This very well could be, as Chinese officials have touted such a project repeatedly in the past, but the latest satellites image making its rounds on social media simply isn’t that prototype. The satellite image (seen above) is said to have been taken of Chengdu, where China’s company by the same name builds and tests many of the country’s most capable fighters, including the J-10 and the now famous J-20 stealth fighter-interceptor among others. That simply isn’t true. The location of the image is at a relatively new radar cross-section measurement facility near the town of Gaobeidian, located roughly 30 miles southwest of Beijing. RCS test facility near Gaobeidian, China. , Google Earth The craft in question, which has a similar planform as Northrop Grumman’s “cranked kite” design found on the company’s X-47B demonstrators, is parked near a light aircraft with a wingspan of roughly 25 feet. This gives the article in question an overall wingspan of roughly 50 feet. The unmanned X-47Bs have a wingspan of 62 feet by comparison. The same location where the flying-wing article is parked in later satellite imagery. , Google Earth So no, this is not China’s new stealth bomber, that aircraft would have a wingspan of at least three times that of the article we see in the photo, nor is it even located at an air base that could facilitate its operation. However, it could possibly be a sub-scale radar cross section measurement mockup that mirror’s the new bomber’s shape and configuration. But this test facility seems to work more with unmanned aircraft than manned ones, and due to its size, it’s most likely an example of an ongoing unmanned aircraft project or a radar cross-section test article to learn more about different potential design configurations and their radar reflectivity, including those that mimic U.S. designs. China’s military and scientific apparatus is notorious for making elaborate scale or near scale replicas of America’s most capable aircraft, and even its own . Another indication of the subject’s less than top secret nature is that according to Terraserver.com, it sat outside between the 9th of July and the 12th of July, and could still be sitting there today. The area is heavily monitored by foreign satellites, so it’s more of a sign that China wanted the US to see it than the other way around. Engineers from a slew of American defense contractors use a large number of Radar Cross Section facilities spread out from Palm Beach, Florida to Boardman, Oregon—with America’s southwest being spotted with many of the installations—to test all types of aircraft and missile designs and shapes. These facilities helped give birth to the age of stealth, including the advent of America’s own first stealth bomber. Today, these installations test designs that we likely won’t see for decades to come if ever at all. So why would China, who undergoing a stealth revolution of their own, be any different? There is a decent chance that we will see China’s new prototype bomber in the not so distant future—which will represent not just a massive leap in combat capability but also one in construction techniques and material science for Beijing—but this absolutely isn’t it. Although it could share its shape, it’s more likely that the article belongs to China’s quickly advancing unmanned combat air vehicle development initiative or that of other flying wing drone programs—like the “Star Glory” SG-1 and CH-805 that are presently underway. The Star Glory in particular looks very similar to the object spotted in the satellite image and its stated dimensions seem near spot on.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain sketchy, but the Arliegh Burke class destroyer USS John S. McCain (DDG-56) collided with the oil tanker Alnic MC east of the Strait of Malacca, near Singapore. The collision occurred at 6:24AM local time. The John S. McCain had been on patrol in the volatile South China Sea where it actively challenged China’s territorial claims and was heading to Singapore for a planned port visit when the incident occurred. The Navy has stated that the destroyer sustained damage on her port aft side, and that search and rescue efforts are underway. There is no official statement as to the number of sailors missing, injured, or dead, nor the condition on the Alnic MC . The tanker vessel is Liberian flagged, 600 feet long, and 104 feet wide. Her gross tonnage is reported as 50,000 tons. The ship was launched in 2007. Alnic MC’s last shown position., Marinetraffic.com The collision occurred just over two months after another Arleigh Burke class destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald , collided with the merchant vessel ACX Crystal under bizarre circumstances off the coast of Japan, and just two days after the Navy released a harrowing report detailing what went on in the moments after the impact.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 21, 2017",Navy Chief Orders Operational Pause And Deep Review After USS John S. McCain Collision,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson has ordered a fairly unprecedented operational pause across the entire US Navy fleet, as well as a comprehensive review of all procedures and training, with an aim at discovering systemic causes related to the spate of at sea collisions over the last year. The announcement comes just hours after the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with the tanker vessel Alnic MC off the coast of Singapore, near the eastern entrance in to the bustling Strait of Malacca. Make sure to check out our previous coverage on the collision here for full background and context. Ten of USS John S. McCain’s sailors are still missing, and the ship, along with other nearby US Navy vessels, including the amphibious flattop USS America , have docked at Changi Naval Base in Singapore. According to the Navy, America will assist the destroyer’s crew in damage and recovery efforts: “While in Singapore, America will provide messing and berthing services to McCain crew members and to support damage control efforts on board. America will also support ongoing searches for 10 missing Sailors. Ship Repair Facility divers are on scene as well to assess the damage to the hull.” The gash in the side of John S. McCain’s hull is massive, measuring roughly 20 by 15 feet—at least what is visible of it. According to the Navy, multiple compartments were rapidly flooded following the impact, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications compartments. CNO Richardson noted during his address, which you can see in full below, that the investigation will include: “Looking at operational tempo, trends in personnel, material, maintenance and equipment. It will also include a review of how we train and certify our surface warfare community, including tactical and navigational proficiency… This review will be on a very tight timeline. I want to get frequent updates. This requires urgent action. We need to get to it and take corrective action.” In just over a year’s time there have been four collisions at sea involving US Navy vessels— USS John S. McCain yesterday , USS Fitzgerald on June 17th , USS Champlain on May 9th , and USS Louisiana last August . Beyond the loss of life and damage to the ships and those vessels they collided with, the US Navy’s fleet is under immense demand, and pulling high-end vessels out of service for months or even years for repairs creates major additional operational deficits. DDG-56 sits pierside, the large rupture in its hull clearly showing., USN There is no doubt that people are aghast with how these collisions continue to occur, especially considering the most recent ones have involved the most advanced warships in the world—ones that are loaded with high-tech sensors used to closely monitor the world around them over hundreds of miles. Unsurprisingly, China’s semi-state news outlet China Daily has gone as far as calling the U.S. Navy a “dangerous obstacle in Asian waters,” stating : “While the US Navy is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters, China has been making joint efforts with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to draw up a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea and it has boosted navigational safety by constructing five lighthouses on its islands.” Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who is currently traveling overseas, seems satisfied with CNO Richardson’s review orders: In the meantime, the search and rescue effort off Singapore continues for the missing sailors, but the search is unlikely to end until the Navy can access the John S. McCain’s flooded compartments either through dewatering or divers. One of the more controversial factors that is sure to come up in the Navy’s wide spanning investigation will be the way sequestration, and the budgetary decisions the Navy made under it, may have contributed to these incidents.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Think Eclipse Traffic Sucks? Check Out The Plane Lineup At Madras Airport In Oregon!,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Those who thought they would beat the eclipse viewing traffic by soaring over it are getting a nasty reality check at little Madras Airport in central Oregon. The video below, shot by Portland NBC affiliate KGW’s helicopter, shows an almost comically huge line of aircraft waiting to take the airport’s main runway for departure. The planes in line for departure range from home-built kit planes to small corporate jets. The town of Madras, which has a population of roughly 7,000 people on a normal day, saw hoards of people flood into the area to watch the once in a lifetime celestial event. The city sits perfectly on the “line of totality” and the area’s weather this time of year is predictably ideal for viewing. Oregon had been in a near emergency state in preparation for a huge influx of eclipse viewers, and traffic was predicted to be near disastrous in the hours before and after the event. With this in mind, aviators and those who could afford to charter an aircraft to leap over the traffic apocalypse below probably thought they had beat the system, but now it looks like that simply isn’t the case. And depending on fuel loads and destinations, some of the aircraft waiting in that huge taxi queue may have to go to the back of the line or wait out the rush so that they can make it to their destination without diverting. Madras was one of the best viewing locations for the eclipse in the entire United States. , Greatamericaneclipse.com Normally, Madras Airport is a relatively quiet place. Sporadic light aircraft traffic is normal, as well as the occasional turboprop or business jet. Erickson International has a large presence at the airport and their firefighting aircraft are usually on the ramp there. Erickson antique aircraft collection is also based at Madras, which includes WWII fighters and bombers. But aside from a small but fun little air show every summer, not much else goes on out there. So anywhere near this type of traffic is totally unheard of at the airfield. Google Earth Making things more precarious, Madras has no air traffic control tower. So deconfliction and coordination of takeoffs and departures is done via open frequency, aircraft-to-aircraft communications. It is unclear if a temporary tower was setup for the eclipse rush or not. But regardless, with one 5,089 foot runway and one 2,701 foot runway available, and many dissimilar aircraft trying to use those runways, things can go wrong real fast. One airplane already crashed on Saturday while approaching the airport, with the pilot dying in the crash. Hopefully everyone’s trip home is safe and predictable.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 21, 2017",Divers Find Remains Of USS McCain Sailors As Reports of Steering Loss Emerge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scott Swift, commander of the Pacific Fleet, has announced that remains of an unknown number of sailors have been identified by divers who recently accessed the USS John S. McCain’s flooded compartments. The Malaysian Navy has also said they have found the remains of sailor during their search operations in the vicinity of where the destroyer collided with the oil tanker Alnic MC on Sunday morning while sailing off the coast of Singapore, near the bustling Strait of Malacca. The first statement released from 7th Fleet today announced that divers were going to try and access the flooded compartments: “Equipped with surface supplied air rigs, divers will access sealed compartments located in damaged parts of the ship. Additionally, they will conduct damage assessments of the hull and flooded areas… Several diving units are supporting search efforts, including Navy divers from Ship Repair Facility Yokosuka and Commander Logistics Group Western Pacific as well as Marine divers from 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked on America.” The second statement followed Admiral Swift’s press conference that reported the news that remains had been found: “…some of the 10 missing USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) Sailors were discovered today by divers performing recovery operations inside the guided-missile destroyer. Swift also said the Royal Malaysian Navy has reported  the discovery of potential remains of another missing McCain Sailor, located while the ship was providing search and rescue assistance east of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.” Similar circumstances occurred during the search for missing sailors involved in the USS Fitzgerald mishap, which also had flooded compartments. The Navy hasn’t given an updated number as to how many sailors are still classified as missing. This will likely take some time depending on the condition of the remains, which Swift refers to as “bodies.” Malaysian sailors move the recovered remains of what they think is one of the McCain’s crew., AP During Admiral Swift’s comments, which parroted the statements above, he noted that USS John S. McCain is badly damaged and that the damage control efforts by her crew saved her from a more gruesome fate. In fact, the crew activated the ship’s flight deck not long after the collision, not just to evacuate the wounded but also to refuel search and rescue helicopters that were looking for their lost shipmates. This feat occurred while the crew was still trying to keep the ship from flooding. Swift also stated that the already announced fleet-wide operational pause will now last through August 28th. A second and more extensive phase of this initiative will only affect U.S. Navy vessels in the Pacific theatre, and will be a “deliberate reset for our ships” according to Swift, focusing on evaluating all forms of each vessel’s operations. There was no timeframe placed on this second phase. The Admiral was also asked about the possibility cyber interference or anything of that sort causing the crash. Swift said they will look into it but there is no indication of such circumstances at this time. The Admiral also says that search and rescue efforts will continue. Here is Admiral Swift’s press conference: Meanwhile, Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces, released a video where he outlined directions for the Navy’s fleet-wide operational pause. The distribution of the video was somewhat odd, as it is fairly technical and jargon filled for such a wide release, but under the circumstances the Navy clearly thinks it needs to do everything it can to assure the public it is competent and seriously intends to solve what has become a vexing, deadly, and somewhat chronic issue. Transparency is a big part of such a strategy. Here’s the video: While theories as to what caused the collision are hurdled around the internet, multiple reports, including from CNN , state that the ship inadvertently lost steering control before the crash. Here is what the CNN report said: “The McCain suffered a steering failure as the warship was beginning its approach into the Strait of Malacca, causing it to collide with a commercial tanker, a Navy official told CNN.The official said it was unclear why the crew couldn’t use the ship’s backup steering systems to maintain control. Earlier, another US Navy official told CNN there were indications the destroyer experienced a loss of steering right before the collision, but steering had been regained afterward.” Reports of loss of steering control are intriguing, but the possibility leads to even more questions than it does answers, especially considering the assumed geometry of the collision. The high-profile nature of the mishap, and the precarious position it has put the Navy in following so many other incidents in just a year’s time, it’s likely we will get at least some basic facts about the moments leading up to crash sooner than normal.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 2, 2020",Audio From The 1999 Shoot Down Of F-117 “Vega 31” Over Serbia Is Chilling,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The one and only time a F-117 Nighthawk was shot down occurred on March 27th, 1999 over Serbia during Operation Allied Force. Its callsign was “Vega 31” and at its controls was Lieutenant Colonel Dale Zelko. The story of how the stealth jet was detected, targeted, and engaged by a Serbian SA-3 “Goa” surface to air missile (SAM) is an amazing tale in itself, as is the fact that Zelko and the intrepid SAM system commander are now friends . What came of the Nighthawk carcass after it crashed down into a field is also quite intriguing. But above all else, the radio transmissions pieced together from that fateful night are downright chilling. Even better than just the recording itself is the recording paired with the first hand account of Dale Zelko. During a seminar, the veteran F-117 pilot goes into awesome detail of his actions that night and how he made it out alive against great odds. The first video below has the radio recording portion of Zelko’s presentation only, while the second video has Dale Zelko’s entire talk on his experiences during the historic event. In other words, the first clip is a short excerpt of the second. Hours after the initial radio calls were made, a massive combat search and rescue operation was launched, one that penetrated deep into enemy territory with the objective of plucking Zelko from the enemy’s clutches. The operation was amazingly successful ( read about it here ), and underlined the talent of American and allied aircrews and the modern-day relevancy of the CSAR mission set. Today, as the USAF fills its inventory with penetrating stealthy combat aircraft like the F-35, F-22, and B-21, and as proliferation of advanced integrated air defense systems, which can include wily road-mobile SAM systems, becomes more commonplace, how exactly this mission will be conducted successfully is debatable. The USAF is finally getting its CSAR community new Black Hawk derivatives—the HH-60W —to replace their worn-out HH-60G Pave Hawks. But how these aircraft can reliably infiltrate into areas where only high-end stealth aircraft can venture, and even they couldn’t survive, is unknown. For lower-end threat environments, the HH-60W’s capabilities, along with a traditional package of assets including A-10 Warthogs in the “Sandy” role, and other aircraft to provide suppression of enemy air defenses, electronic warfare support, command and control, and defensive counter-air capabilities will be applicable. HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter, LockheedMartin/Sikorsky Meanwhile the USMC has adapted their tactics to take full advantage of the MV-22 Osprey’s great qualities for what they call the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission. The Osprey has speed on its side, which is critical for the CSAR/TRAP mission set, but the same issues apply to the Osprey as the HH-60W and even the Air Force Special Operations Command’s CV-22s—even with low-level flying and external support from myriad of assets, can an Osprey survive in a higher-end contested environment where stealth aircraft pilots could inadvertently find themselves on the ground in the future? Regardless, the CSAR community is making the best out of what they have and are training with assets like the F-22 in forward deployed scenarios . But the mismatch in capabilities between the two platforms, and even the with the forthcoming HH-60W, is glaring. With these issues in mind, it would seem that in the most critical of situations, the best aircraft for recovering a stealth aircraft pilot is another stealth aircraft. As we all well know the Pentagon has the technology, and the high-end CSAR mission seems like a key niche that requires it, a solution I have laid out in detail before . As of now there are no known plans to provide the CSAR community with a low observable design for the toughest of CSAR missions. This means either the Air Force is willing to accept much higher risk for future CSAR missions or that they simply won’t be able to attempt to rescue pilots in certain contested environments at all. Then again the USAF could just avoid much of the this CSAR conundrum by fielding advanced unmanned combat air vehicles for the highest risk, “day one” missions like deep strike and destruction of enemy air defenses. Sadly, for one reason or another that isn’t happening. It is somewhat alarming that the USAF is buying throngs of expensive stealth aircraft that are meant to penetrate deep into highly defended enemy airspace and survive but they don’t seem to be investing in CSAR capabilities to match. This has also been a concern of on Capitol Hill, one that doesn’t seem to have been quenched by the purchase of the HH-60W. We’ll have to see how this all pans out. Hopefully future pilot recovery missions will be able to be as successful as the response to the downing of Vega 31 nearly twenty years ago. But tactics can only go so far and it will likely take significantly more investment by the USAF to make that a real possibility, especially when it comes to facing the challenges that future combat environments represent.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Head Of Israel’s Air Force States “We Prevented Going To War” In Must Read Interview,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days ago, Major General Amir Eshel retired after over 40 years of service. During the last five years of his career he was the commander of the vaunted Israeli Air Force. During his tenure in that position, Eshel prepared for war with Iran, fought enemies within Israel’s own borders, and dealt with a massive shift in power in the region as Russia embedded itself deeply into the Syrian civil war. Now he is talking about all this and more in an amazingly open manner. The piece by Haaretz reporter Amos Harel, which can and should be read in full here , gives us an unprecedented insight into the nexus between Israel’s foreign policy goals and the application of hard military capabilities that the IAF provides. Since its founding, the IAF has been known for its ingenuity as much as its combat prowess. That history has been built by introspective and creative commanders like Eshel. General Eshel inspects his airmen with a Shavit in the background. , IAF One of the most successful series of operations the IAF has spearheaded in the last five years has been the relatively quiet but constant interdiction of high-end weapons funneled through Syria to Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Here’s the remarkable exchange: Most of the information about the attacks draws on reports in the international media. What is the Israeli public not understanding about this story? “I think the public understands well. The prime minister and the defense minister made declarations to the effect that there are things that Israel will not allow to happen. They made the declaration with the intention of carrying it out. There’s a wide range of actions that can be taken and there have been a great many successes. If we hadn’t succeeded, the potential threats would be far more significant today.” Did the air force adversely affect Hezbollah’s military capabilities? “Of things that Hezbollah wanted to have in its possession, a large part was unrealized. I will give you numbers, ballpark figures. Israel is coping with terrorism far from its borders, too. If you take the activity against terrorism in its newer sense – the campaign against the conveyance of strategic means of combat – it’s not that Israel didn’t do similar things in the past. It did, but the situation in the Middle East has changed. Until 2012, if you go back 10 years, there were very few preemptive operations, far from the border, by the air force. You can count them on fewer than the fingers of one hand. And there were operations, I don’t have to tell you, by the Mossad.” “Since 2012, I am talking about many dozens of operations. Let’s say that the number is close to three figures, in the northern sector and in other sectors. An operation can be something solitary, small and point-specific, or it can be an intensive week in which a great many items are involved. Happily, it occurs under the radar. You can view it as a direct accomplishment, given the equipment that’s destroyed. But something else also happened, which I find very significant: We succeeded in not plunging Israel into wars.” Could that have happened? “Easily. A mistake could have many components: undesirable friction with enemies, with great powers, or all of it together. The smart thing is to be effective, to achieve what’s required, but below the bar at which we escalate into war. And in the Middle East, it’s very easy to escalate into war. I think this is a great achievement. It’s easy enough to be a bull in a china shop. We were able to act rightly and not get into a war. In some cases the force we used was like a hammer, and in some cases it was just a small ‘click,’ and that’s enough. And if you factor in the excellent intelligence – really extraordinary intelligence – and the determination of the decision makers, that means that when Israel has vested interests, it acts despite the risks. I think that in the eyes of our enemies, as far as I understand it, this is a language that’s understood here and also understood far from the Middle East.” Is it understood in Moscow, too? “Yes. There’s something else here, which we will be able to gauge only in hindsight, but in my view, our actions reduced the possibility of war. We didn’t eliminate it, it doesn’t mean that there won’t be some miscalculation tomorrow – anything is possible. But when someone feels that you know more about them than they would have expected, and when you’re determined to act, even when it looks impossible, and you act sharply and precisely, that doesn’t generate a desire for wars.” “I’m the last person who wants to convey a message here that the wars in the Middle East are done with. I will say it very soberly. I am not deluding myself, because things can lurch out of control here. But every action like that – and they know what’s going on – is a message that is understood very well: ‘It’s not worth it, not now.’ That’s a positive result of these operations, even if it’s not their central aim.” F-35I and F-16I over Israel. , IAF Eshel was then asked about how Israel has dealt with Russia’s arrival in Syria and its military operations in the region since. “We realized that a new and very significant player had entered the arena… A potential for friction, one that could cause dangerous results, had been created. Certainly we have nothing against them, but we have interests and they have interests, and they converge in the Syrian airspace. How do you reduce the possibility of unintended mutual harm? The strategic consequences could be serious. To date, it [the mechanism that was worked out] has stood the test well.” In November 2015, Turkish planes downed a Russian warplane on the Syria-Turkey border, sparking a serious crisis between Moscow and Istanbul. Israel sought to prevent, almost at any price, a similar clash with the Russians. “There’s one thing you have to understand: In the air, things can happen within a second, with all due respect to a directive by Putin or by the prime minister,” Eshel explains. “In the end, the question is: How do we foster a situation in which a lieutenant here, or his counterpart on the Russian side, doesn’t make that mistake. The lieutenant has to decide here and now, and it’s possible that within a second he will have made a mistake, and we’ve gone and entangled Israel. That’s something we cannot allow ourselves. In the technical sense, we reduce the possibility that this will happen. We know how to communicate. We do not coordinate our activity with the Russians in advance. It’s not that we tell them what we are going to do [in Syria].” How does it work, if you don’t coordinate with them? “There’s something technical here, and there are leaders’ directives, and trust. We don’t intend to harm the Russians, and we do everything to avoid harming them. They understand why we are taking action. They don’t agree or give us authorization, but I think they understand what Israel is doing. It is fighting terrorism, preventing the delivery of means of combat.” Agreement isn’t part of the story? “It’s not a matter of agreement. Sovereign states need to respect other states, and in this case we are both involved with the same geographical slot. We have no beef with the Russians. We do have a beef with deliveries of arms that endanger our security.” t’s been almost two years. Have Russian planes or defense systems locked on to Israeli planes? Were there situations of near-confrontation? “Locking on is not a situation of almost being hit. There have been no situations of near-clash, because we are conducting ourselves correctly. When I look now at the scope of Russian activity during two years, at how many times they have violated Israeli sovereignty, my point of departure is that the majority were by mistake, it’s nothing. There were situations in which we contacted them in real time and said that there had been a mistake [of the Russians entering Israeli airspace], and they immediately responded and corrected. That’s alright. We have not seen provocations.” Still, when a pilotless plane – apparently Russian – appears suddenly in Israel’s skies, what happens? “Everything tenses up, certainly. We do what needs to be done. It’s all at top speed, but we behave responsibly. I think the Russians know that we are not Turkey.” The interview goes onto talk about Iran and military operations in Gaza, as well as the changing nature of Israel’s military relationship with Arab countries. He even discusses the F-35I and what it brings to the IAF. Once again, you can read the rest of the piece here .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Mattis has said time and time again that the only reason he came out of retirement to become Donald Trump’s Secretary of Defense was so he could get back working with and for the troops in field. He clearly sees America’s soldiers, sailors, airman, and marines as a class of their own and is known to give off-the-cuff talks to groups of them whenever he can. During these impromptu speeches he seems to let much of his guard down and offers unique insights into his thinking on various topics. He recently discussed the future of America’s nuclear triad in a uniquely frank manner with submariners in Washington state. Now he has done the same with soldiers in the middle east, but this time the topic was about the recent spate of social strife here in the United States. As usual, Mattis provided multiple memorable quotes in the short speech, including: “We’ll go out here, we’ll fight alongside our friends and allies, and were gonna keep right on fighting until they’re sick of us and leave us alone.” Yet the purpose of his speech seemed to be to reassure his troops that things will get better at home: “Your buying time, your a great example for our country right now, it’s got some problems, you know it and I know it. It’s got problems we don’t have in the military. And you just hold the line my fine young soldiers, sailors, airman, and marines. You just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other, showing it, being friendly to one another, that Americans owe to one another, we’re so dog gone lucky to be Americans.” Mattis continued to illustrate in an abstract way how he sees America and its ability to project power, stating: “We’ve got two powers, the power of inspiration, we’ll get the power of inspiration back, and we have the power of intimidation, and that’s you if someone wants to screw with out families, our country, or our allies. “ Then Mattis explained why he was there: “I flunked retirement ok, the only reason I came back was to serve alongside young people like you who are so selfless and frankly, so rambunctious. It’s a pleasure to be around you all.” Here’s the whole video, it’s is well worth the watch: I am going to leave it there because analyzing his words could go many different directions politically speaking, especially in relation to the actions of his boss, President Donald Trump.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 30, 2017",One Of North Korea’s Most Dangerous Weapons Is The Ancient An-2 Biplane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With tensions between North Korea and the U.S., South Korea, and its allies at an all time high, and as the U.S. and South Korea execute combat drills , Pyongyang ordered its own military show of force. North Korea’s recent exercises included a massive artillery barrage and an amphibious assault near the maritime border between the two long time foes. Images released by state media shows North Korea’s modernized commando units going through their paces, but one picture was of especially unique interest. The photo in question shows a gaggle of An-2 biplanes dropping North Korean commandos at low altitude. At first glance it just looks like another canned and somewhat laughable military display by the North Koreas, but it’s actually relevant practice for what North Korea has planned for the opening hours of an all-out conflict on the peninsula. North Korean State Media During the dark of night, as part of the opening throws of a battle royale between South Korea, the U.S. and North Korea, hundreds of these old radial engine biplanes will fly low over the ground at slow speed, penetrating deep into South Korean airspace. For the vast majority of their crews it will be a one-way mission—to deliver Kim Jong Un’s hardest shock troops deep behind enemy lines. This is done via low altitude air drop, as seen above, or by landing in short stretches of fields or roadways. The missions of these North Korean suicide assault teams are many fold, but generally they pertain to creating total havoc deep inside South Korean territory. This includes attacking key infrastructure and military installations, and generally sowing massive terror among the already frightened South Korean populace. This deep insertion tactic alone is one of the main reasons why installations like air bases in South Korea must be prepared for instant war, even on the foot soldier level. Even Kim Jong Un, who loves aviation , has been seen in the cockpit of an AN-2 Colt. , North Korea State Media The fact that North Korea is now a nuclear nation and seems to have at least a workable miniaturized warhead design means these biplanes pose an even greater risk than ever before—they could also become a non-traditional nuclear delivery system. It is just the unorthodox play that Pyongyang could use to take out major military installations or critical capabilities without using a ballistic missile. It may seem downright laughable at first glance that North Korea would throw up antiquated agricultural/utility aircraft which were designed the better part of a century ago against the might of the USAF and ROKAF, but first glances can be very deceiving. The An-2 Colt is a fabric covered flying machine that is at home muscling through the sky at very low altitudes and slow airspeed. This translates into a small radar cross-section for its size, one that is hard to spot by fighters using their radars in look-down-shoot-down mode. Flying at low altitude means traditional surface-to-air missile systems will have a very hard time of detecting and engaging these aircraft as they plot along south, hugging the terrain. Their slow speed also plays nasty tricks on pulse doppler radars whose velocity gates (filters) often discount relatively slow moving objects, especially when they are moving at oblique angles from the radar emitter. Even Washington DC, arguably the most surveilled and highly secured airspace in the United States, along with its elaborate integrated air defense system, couldn’t spot a slow moving target with a small radar cross section even as it flew down the National Mall and landed on the Capitol’s lawn. Finally, the old adage that quantity has a quality all its own rings true with the An-2 and North Korea’s war plans. North Korea has the ability to fill the sky with roughly 300 of these aircraft. During a time of war, there wouldn’t be enough fighter aircraft or surface to air missile batteries to shoot them down even if they could be detected and successfully engaged. Additionally, it is well assumed by Pyongyang that they will lose many of these aircraft, but that’s the hardcore nature of the tactics behind their use. Even if half the fleet is lost, still thousands of shock commandos will be on the ground in South Korea causing mayhem. North Korea State Media Also keep in mind, even if runways can be cratered before these aircraft can get into the air during the opening actions of a major conflict, they can takeoff from virtually anywhere. With all this in mind, maybe the best defense against these aircraft are large amounts of short-range air defense systems (SHORADS) placed all over the country. These systems can spot and engage low flying aircraft with small radar cross sections. But the truth is that there are only a limited number of these types of systems deployed by the U.S. or the ROK. But even these systems couldn’t provide anywhere near reliable coverage over the entirety of airspace south of the DMZ, and they can only engage a handful of targets until their magazines run dry. As such, it seems like this threat will be largely dealt with once the commandos are already on the ground. North Korea State Media Once again, the mainstream media has been quick to disregard North Korea’s dated arsenal. This is the same reason why so many underestimated the country’s ability to field a nuclear weapon and long-range delivery system by the end of the decade. The cold, hard truth is that the North Koreans aren’t stupid and their outlandish rhetoric and propaganda hide the existence of a much more logical and creative military apparatus than most would care to admit. Their seemingly innocuous fleet of AN-2 biplanes is just another reminder of this reality.

Boeing seeks to make the F/A-18 Super Hornet the Indian Navy’s primary naval fighter of the future—one that can fly from both India’s ski-jump equipped aircraft carriers in the near term and catapult equipped ones in the future. Confirmation that the Super Hornet could operate with a relevant weapons loads from short-takeoff but arrested recovery (STOBAR) aircraft carriers came following a big Super Hornet pitch meeting in New Delhi put on by Boeing, after which Indian defense page Livefist interviewed Dan Gillian, VP of the Super Hornet program. During the interview, Gillian stated: “We’ve done a lot of simulation work with the Indian Navy to better understand their requirements and we fill comfortable that the Super Hornet can operate from all their carriers, both the ones fielded today and the ones in the future… We think we can move around the deck, be very mission capable with a relevant weapons load-out and fuel load-out to give the Navy what they need… The Super Hornet as built today can operate from Indian carriers.” F/A-18E Super Hornet, AP India currently fields the Russia- built MiG-29K for its STOBAR fighter needs. These aircraft has been plagued with serviceability and carrier environment suitability issues since they entered service less than a decade ago. Also, the current navalized Fulcrum isn’t capable of catapult launches, whereas the Super Hornet is. https://youtube.com/watch?v=asruP9cigQk India plans on fielding catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) configured aircraft carriers in the 2020s, but before that it will add two more ski jump equipped carriers to its fleet. The first of these vessels, named the INS Vikrant , is being indigenously designed and built and is slated for commissioning before the end of the decade, but it could be some time after before it is actually ready for patrols . INS Vikrant being moved for fitting out. , Indian Navy Two Vikrant class ships will be built before the Indian Navy plans to switch over to CATBAR configured carriers. These two Vikrant class carriers will join the INS Vikramaditya, which is currently India’s only fixed-wing aircraft carrier. The Vikramaditya was heavily modified by Russia for the Indian Navy, turning what was a Kiev class heavy aircraft carrying cruiser into a similar configuration as the Soviet-era Kuznetsov class aircraft carriers that Russia and China currently operates. The project ran hideously over budget and behind schedule. With big carrier ambitions, India needs fighters that can make the most of its shipbuilding investments. The Indian Navy is currently looking for 57 new fighters to fulfill this role under the multi-role carrier-borne fighter (MRCBF) program, and that number will likely grow as the Indian Navy’s carrier fleet expands in the coming decade. MiG-29K undergoing heavy work. , AP Currently the Super Hornet, Rafale, Gripen, and MiG-29K are in the running. Even the F-35B and F-35C could be possible contenders, but at this time it is unclear if the Joint Strike Fighter will be formally offered. Only the Rafale and Super Hornet are CATOBAR capable today. The MiG-29K would be upgraded for catapult launch capabilities and may port over some technology from the latest MiG-35 Fulcrum variant. Gripen-E would have to be navalized completely, but the SAAB has closely studied doing this under the Sea Gripen concept for years. Also, the Gripen is single engine and it seems like the Indian Navy is interested in a twin engine design, but still, Gripen is a hardy and efficient combat jet and has a lot to offer the Indian Navy. Sea Gripen concept., SAAB Whichever naval fighter India picks, industrial offsets and technology transfer will be a major factor in the decision. Assembling the jets in India seems to be a key component of any deal and Boeing has said they would be willing to set up an assembly line in the country under a “make in India” initiative. How exactly this will sit with President Trump’s “America First” economic policy is yet to be understood. INS Vikramaditya with a full load of MiG-29Ks and helicopters., Indian Navy Gillian noted that Boeing already has many parts built in India and has over 160 suppliers there, and described Boeing’s willingness to start Super Hornet production to India as such : “We are talking about creating a next generation facility in India. We think the Super Hornet is the most advanced airplane that India could manufacture which will lead to the next generation of airplane that India will design and build here… We envisioned bringing a large part of it to India. It’s not about moving our production line…. We think we can bring best of the Boeing to India. We can create a next generation 21st century factory in India to build Super Hornet.” Gillian also mentions that the same factory built for Super Hornet production could be used to build India’s next generation indigenous fighter aircraft in the future. How Boeing would be involved in that initiative and what level of technology the company would be able to hand over to India to make it happen remains unknown. Gillian underlines that by building the Super Hornet in India, the country will then have the “aerospace ecosystem” that will allow them to build a next generation fighter themselves. He also claims that the Super Hornet is the most modern airplane to manufacture in the competition, which seems like a questionable claim. Rafale M is a mature carrier-borne fighter design. , AP When it comes to what the Super Hornet can bring to the Indian Navy, Gillian was clear that it wouldn’t be the jet we know today, but one in the highly upgraded “Block III” configuration. “We think the Super Hornet is a next-gen aircraft… We continue to build them for the US Navy. We are going to bring the Block III Super Hornet online, a next gen fighter that is both networked and survivable. It has a high level of stealth and a great EW suite [electronic warfare], it has an AESA radar that has been integrated and flying for years. We’re bringing out an infrared search and track sensor—a great package of sensors and equipment that make it a very lethal next generation fighter. It will be operating as a front-line aircraft well into 2040. We think the aircraft speaks for itself from capabilities standpoint—lowest cost per flight hour of any airplane in the US inventory [obviously that is not accurate], that’s a huge advantage as you build a large fleet.” Make sure to watch the full interview below: Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has confirmed that North Korea has fired a missile that has traveled over Japan. At this point we have no idea what type of missile this is or its destination. The launch comes as tensions have soared on the Korean Peninsula over the last month following the declaration of ICBM capability by North Korea and the now infamous “fire and fury” remarks made by President Donald Trump. The missile flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido and continued to track out into the Pacific. The launch resulted in alerts being sent to the Japanese population to take cover. North Korea has not tested missiles on shallow down-range optimized arcs for some time, instead using steep parabolic trajectories that keep the missiles from leaving the waters off its own shores. Kim Jong Un also said he would “wait and see” before ordering a major intermediate-range ballistic missile show of force by firing missiles into the waters off Guam. Regardless of if this missile nears Guam or not, it is a massive provocation and escalation to say the least. UPDATE 3pm PST: Japan says the missile broke into three parts before impacting the water some 700 miles east of Hokkaido. It is not clear if this was a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) test or a technical failure. We will be updating this post live as more info becomes available. UPDATE 3:17pm PST: Here is the official telemetry data according to South Korea military via Yonhap News-2,700 km down-range at apogee of 550km. UPDATE 3:35pm PST: CNN’s reporter in Pyongyang said the missile was launched from Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. UPDATE 4:00pm PST: Here is the warning that followed sirens in Japan as the missile approached- UPDATE 5:12pm PST: This is the first time a North Korean missile has flown over Japan since 2009. Now that Pyongyang has escalated to firing missiles over major population centers in Japan we could see more tests aimed at validating North Korea’s missile arsenal down-range abilities. All of North Korea’s new missile systems have not been tested in this manner. The big question is will the U.S., South Korea, and Japan standby to watch these tests occur yet alone the one that was executed today?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 30, 2020",A U.S. Navy Nuclear Submarine Once Submerged In A River To Ride Out A Hurricane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In September of 1989, Hurricane Hugo came roaring towards America’s southeastern seaboard. People rushed to prepare for the storm’s arrival, including the U.S. Navy. At Charleston Naval Base in South Carolina, submarines scrambled out to sea, but a handful which were undergoing or awaiting heavy maintenance had no way of escaping Hugo’s onslaught. One of these vessels was the Navy’s 100th nuclear submarine, the USS Narwhal (SSN-671). Hugo made landfall in South Carolina on the 22nd September as a class four hurricane. 20 foot storm surges and ten inches of rain were experienced in some areas along the coast. Narwhal’s crew were onboard the submarine, which had its nuclear reactor offline as it was awaiting its turn in dry dock for a complex refueling and overhaul, as the center of the storm approached the base. Narwhal’s mooring lines were fortified in preparation for the storm’s arrival. Two three inch lines and nine double wires were supposed to keep the 314 foot sub in place but as the first half of the storm hit, all but one line had snapped and the submarine began to drift out into the Cooper River. As the eye of the storm passed over, brave tugboat crews—read about their crazy ordeal here — and the Narwhal’s crew tried to keep the nuclear fast attack sub from being pulled away, but the winds and currents were too strong. With the second half of the storm fast approaching, the Narwhal’s commanding officer had to make a very tough call. He could either let the nuclear submarine drift away with the wind and current or he could do the unthinkable, dive the boat in the middle of the river. With no diesel fuel onboard and the reactor cold, running only on battery power, the dive alarm was sounded and Narwhal’s crew executed their orders, dropped anchor, flooded the sub’s ballast tanks and submerging to the river bed. Just the submarine’s sail and masts were left sticking up out of the water (pictured at the top of this article). The crew sat in the submarine with everything off but emergency lighting to wait out the storm, watching the hurricane’s 150mph winds rage around them through the narrow field of view of submarine’s periscope. The captain’s bold plan worked, it took some time the next morning to break the boat free from the silt it lay in, but Narwhal and her crew came out unscathed. The submarine went on to get its refueling and refit and served another decade as part of her 30 year long career. The captain’s call could have lost him his command or even his entire career, but according to reports, instead his quick thinking resulted in an early promotion.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are usually dependent on satellite imagery to see what’s new at the U.S. government’s top secret flight test center at Groom Lake—better known as Area 51. But once in a while someone climbs Tikaboo peak with quality camera equipment and we get an entirely different type of look of the sprawling clandestine base. A new video posted on Youtube does just that. Tikaboo Peak is the last vantage point on terra firma where the public can clearly view Area 51. I described the locale in a past piece about a family who owned a mine overlooking Groom Lake and their land battle with the USAF: “The once-popular Area 51 viewing spot known as Freedom Ridge—seized as part of a government land grab in the mid 1990s—was 12 miles from the base. Today, the closest direct viewpoint of the base is Tikaboo Peak, some 26 miles away, and photographers still get amazingly detailed pictures of the base from this far-off point of view.” Google Earth Although it was produced by the UFO related group “UFO Seekers,” the video does an outstanding job at giving viewers a sense of the rugged terrain leading up to and surrounding Tikaboo Peak and what you would find there once you made the drive and hike. In particular it shows the new “weather station” erected atop the mountain, which is clearly as much about providing persistent surveillance of summit as it is about monitoring meteorological conditions. The video gives us a good look at the majority of the base, including the massive new hangar built near the southern threshold of the base’s runway. In previous panoramic images shot from Tikaboo Peak in 2014 we noted how tall the new facility was shaping up to be while it was still under construction. Youtube Screencap The relatively large elongated rectangular hangar situated across from the old A-12 hangars seems to have a massive hole ripped in its roof. In the past, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters have been seen parked near this hangar. The hangar was built between mid 2009 and mid 2010.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Funky But Innovative M16 Machine Pistol Was Made For The Bradley Fighting Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle development program is infamous when it comes to convoluted Pentagon procurement initiatives, but it did go on to successfully serve in Iraq during two separate and very different wars. Of all the M2 Bradley’s supposed innovations, one of the most unique accessories that were developed along with it was a funky derivative of the M16 assault rifle tailored for firing from the armored fighting vehicle’s six firing ports. In some aspects, the weapon, although dated by today’s standards, was far ahead of its time when the first Bradleys began being fielded in the early 1980s. The M231 Firing Port Weapon (FPW) is certainly one of the more obscure derivatives of Eugene Stoner’s iconic rifle design. It came out of a requirement to field the Bradley with a new weapon that was particularly well suited for firing from inside the vehicle’s tight confines, through its gun ports, even while on the move. The gun ports themselves were largely a response to the same feature being included in the latest Russian armored personnel carriers of the era. In fact, before the Bradley program was officially underway, a similar requirement existed for the program’s predecessor, the doomed Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV). M2 Bradley IFV circa 1985., DoD By the mid 1970s, the Army was looking at different designs to fulfill its Firing Port Weapon requirement and by 1979 a derivative of the M16A1 developed by the Rock Island Armory was settled upon. At first the design, which uses an open bolt firing concept and extra heavy bolt carrier group, had a short barrel and small wire-framed, twin-armed, telescoping stock. Basically it was the grandfather of modern day Personal Defense Weapon derivatives of the AR-15/M16. As development continued and the Bradley finally began to take shape, the M231’s barrel was increased in length from 11 to 15.6 inches to better take advantage of the 5.56X45mm round’s ballistic properties. The telescoping stock was also omitted. Some say it was left off production versions of the weapon because it got in the way when firing the weapon from inside the Bradley. Other reports state it was left off to deter soldiers from using the compact FPW while dismounted instead of their primary combat rifle, the M16. The finalized M231 configuration. , Guns.wikia.com The M231 used a special buffer design with multiple nested springs instead of just one buffer spring. The buffer tube looks very much like AR-15 pistol buffer assemblies that are so common in the civilian firearms marketplace today, but at the time of the M231’s genesis, the AR-15 pistol was still a very obscure oddity in itself. It wouldn’t be until the early ’90s that the concept would really catch on. Unlike modern AR-15 pistol derivatives, the M231 was only fully auto capable. Early attempts to drastically slow its firing rate were left off in the production versions. A special screw-in attachment on the rifle’s forearm furniture was used to attach itself to the firing ports in the Bradley. The weapon has no traditional sights, just the grooved carry handle of the M16A1. In the end Colt was chosen to produce the weapons to coincide with the Bradley introduction into service in 1982. Originally, only the lighter weight M196 tracer round was authorized to be used with the weapon due to its barrel’s slow twist. Tracers also would help troops attempt to “walk” their fire onto targets outside the vehicle. The current and slightly heavier M855 round can also be used considering the short-ranges the weapon was intended for. Long-range accuracy simply isn’t a major concern for a defensive weapon like the M231. https://youtube.com/watch?v=sExH-PKiiZI Officially, the M231 was only to be used inside the Bradley. It may have felt handy but it was and still is a questionable personal defense weapon. Muzzle rise from full auto firing, no stock, and no sights made it truly a “spray and pray” device. Not just that but its hand guard would rapidly heat up under fire. It was also incredibly loud. In the end the whole idea that troops would man the Bradley’s six firing ports during battle and that these weapons would provide sustained and accurate defensive fire from multiple directions proved to be reaching concept. Over time the Bradley had all but two of its rear firing ports sealed off. But that doesn’t mean the service chucked their M231s. The odd rifles ended up being used by soldiers during combat operations exactly how the Army originally said not to use them—as close-range personal defense weapons. These deadly “lead hoses” of sorts were used to defend combat vehicles from being overrun in urban environments, but not by being fired from deep within the vehicle’s bowels, but from up top where crews were often exposed. From what we can tell they remain in the inventory today in limited numbers and over the last decade or so they have found themselves in M1 tankers hands as well as in those of Bradley crews. Even turret gunners in up-armored Humvees have carried them, like Medal of Honor recipient and American hero Private First Class Ross McGinnis . In 2006 a handful of M231’s were disassembled and their forearm collars were used on a project called the M870REV Non-Lethal Shotgun System. Developed by the Picantinny Arsenal, the project saw Remington 870 shotguns modified to shoot through the firing ports of the EM113REV armored rapid entry vehicle. These APCs were used in overseas jails and detention compounds. The idea was that rioters could be fired at from within the armored personnel carrier with less than lethal shotgun rounds. Doing so could also keep marauders at bay while rioter-placed obstacles are cleared. You can read more about this program here . RDECOM RDECOM In the last decade and a half there have been many weapons that have become available that are far better suited for protecting Bradley, Abrams, or HUMVEE crews from very close-range threats, but the M231 was an available and paid for asset—one that many units didn’t seem to want. Even though today the M231 seems to offer far too many compromises for its revised purpose, it’s hard to argue against the idea that it was a pioneer of the modern AR-15 pistol and PDW as much as it was a relic of an era now past.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 3, 2017","North Korea Shows H-Bomb Warhead Design, Says It Will Use It In EMP Strike","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kim Jong Un wasn’t about to let the United States enjoy its labor day weekend without giving a reminder of the increasing threat his regime poses to America and its allies. New pictures have emerged showing what appears to be a mature thermonuclear warhead design, one that is capable of fitting into the tight confines of the rogue regime’s latest long-range ballistic missile designs. North Korea’s supposed H-bomb design. In the background you can see the nose cones used on North Korea HS-14 ICBM., North Korea State Media A “hydrogen” or “thermonuclear” bomb is exponentially more powerful than nuclear “fission” or “atom” bomb, like the ones used on Japan in World War II. Go to this live map to see for yourself the differences in effects between atom bombs and thermonuclear bombs, and different warhead types and yields, overlaid on a map of your home town. It offers a chilling depiction of just how much destruction modern nuclear warheads provide. Livescience.com gives a good description of how these two types of nuclear weapons physically differ: “The difference between thermonuclear bombs and fission bombs begins at the atomic level. Fission bombs, like those used in Nagasaki and Hiroshima , work by splitting the nucleus of an atom. When the neutrons, or neutral particles, of the atom’s nucleus split, some hit the nuclei of nearby atoms, splitting them, too. The result is a very explosive chain reaction. The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki exploded with the yield of 15 kilotons and 20 kilotons of TNT, respectively, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists . In contrast, the first test of a thermonuclear weapon, or hydrogen bomb, in the United States in November 1952 yielded an explosion on the order of 10,000 kilotons of TNT. Thermonuclear bombs start with the same fission reaction that powers atomic bombs — but the majority of the uranium or plutonium in atomic bombs actually goes unused. In a thermonuclear bomb, an additional step means that more of the bomb’s explosive power becomes available. First, an igniting explosion compresses a sphere of plutonium-239, the material that will then undergo fission. Inside this pit of plutonium-239 is a chamber of hydrogen gas. The high temperatures and pressures created by the plutonium-239 fission cause the hydrogen atoms to fuse. This fusion process releases neutrons, which feed back into the plutonium-239, splitting more atoms and boosting the fission chain reaction.” Wikicommons We will have to wait for full analysis by nuclear weapons scientists to gain deeper insights into what the photos show and what they don’t, but the design does look alarming legitimate, and its construction seems to be of high quality. Miniaturized thermonuclear warheads usually have “stepped down” bullet-like contours for Teller-Ulam configurations or are of an hour-glass like shape with the primary and secondary arranged in two sphere-like casings as seen in the photos from North Korea. You can see how the warhead fits in the missile’s nosecone in the image posted on the display board next to Kim Jong Un., North Korea State Media Below is a picture of the U.S. W80 thermonuclear warhead: W80 nuclear warhead., Wikicommons/public domain The images posted today of North Korea’s supposed thermonuclear bomb design also may help validate to Pyongyang’s claim that they have miniaturized their atom bomb design dramatically. A tested miniaturized nuclear warhead and reentry system are seen as two of the final boxes to be checked off before North Korea’s long-range nuclear deterrent is considered verified. For those who are quick to discount these photos as a propaganda disinformation play, that is always a possibility. But the truth is that North Korea has done exactly what it said it would and has shown off what ended up being real weapons systems, not fakes, over the last 18 months. For instance, nearly all of the weapons North Korea paraded around on April 15th, many of which were never tested before, have now been tested. This is a grand departure from years past. Simply put, Pyongyang’s open and frighteningly honest presentation of their nuclear capabilities and missile programs has been consistent as it has been startling as of late. Just a year and a half ago many laughed at the picture below, but it ended up being largely representative of where North Korea’s nuclear warhead program was headed at the time. North Korea State Media Following their fourth nuclear test on January 6th, 2016, North Korea had claimed it tested a hydrogen bomb. These claims were debunked as seismic and atmospheric sampling data, as well as other intelligence, said otherwise. What North Korea likely tested instead was a “boosted fission device.” This is an atom bomb that compresses tritium and deuterium gas during detonation. This enhances the yield of a fission weapon considerably, but it doesn’t come anywhere close to the destructive power of a hydrogen bomb. But this test and North Korea’s claims did point to the fact that the reclusive regime was not content with fission bombs alone—thermonuclear weapons were its real developmental goal. With all this in mind, there is a possibility that the status of North Korea’s hydrogen bomb program could be why the country’s sixth nuclear test has not occurred. National security pundits have longed claimed a sixth test is imminent and North Korea has said that it would carry out another test when it’s ready. Almost weekly we get new reports of “suspicious movements” at North Korea’s Punggye-ri underground nuclear test facility, yet a year after North Korea’s last test, and the advent of a reliable intermediate range and intercontinental ballistic missile capability, we are still waiting for that sixth test. It could be that North Korea has waited because the next weapon they test won’t be an atom bomb, it will be a hydrogen bomb. Going from a miniaturized atom bomb to a thermonuclear weapon, and a miniaturized one at that, is a massive and highly unlikely leap for the closed-off and poor country like North Korea. But it’s clear they are getting help from somewhere and they have accomplished seemingly the impossible when it comes to their missile programs over the last 18 months. So it wouldn’t be crazy to postulate that their nuclear weapons program is about to take a similar leap. Regardless if or when a North Korean hydrogen bomb test occurs, the rogue state is making it clear what they intend to do with these types of capabilities. North Korea’s state media proclaimed the following today: “The H-bomb, the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton, is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP (electromagnetic pulse) attack according to strategic goals.” They quoted Kim as saying: “All components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes … were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants.” The high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) threat from North Korea has long been feared, and now that they have a delivery system that can hit the U.S. it is more realizable than ever before. But a North Korea launched HEMP attack is far more of an issue for North Korea’s neighbors, like Japan, or even Hawaii, than it is for the continental United States. A cyber attack aimed at the power grid in the U.S. is a far more likely tactic North Korea could deploy here at home. Yet the possibility that North Korea has or will acquire H-bomb capability in the not too far off future makes the EMP threat more palpable than before Pyongyang released these latest images. After an astonishing year of weapons development, and almost exactly one year since the last North Korean nuclear test, it seems that the next big escalation will be another underground nuclear test. When that will come is anyone’s guess, but it will probably be sooner than later. Author’s note: This was written before North Korea executed their sixth nuclear test. Here is our post on the test.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 17, 2017",North Korea Has Executed Its Sixth Nuclear Test (Updating Live),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just hours after posting pictures of Kim Jong Un examining what appears to be a miniaturized thermonuclear warhead , North Korea executed their sixth underground nuclear test. The detonation was detected via seismic sensors around the region, including those in South Korea and in China. The last time North Korea detonated a nuclear device was just shy of a year ago , on September 9th, 2016. South Korea and the US Geological Survey first said the quake was detected at 12:20pm local time at very shallow depths and had a magnitude of 5.6. This number has since been revised to 5.7. It is likely that it will be revised again as more data is collected. At first it was reported that a second explosion was detected shortly after the first, but this report has since been rebuked by the South Korean government. The epicenter is thought to have been at North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site. This latest detonation is substantially more powerful than past tests. A 5.3 magnitude quake was detected from the 2016 test. It was determined the yield of that weapon was more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during WWII. The whole region has now gone on alert following the test. Japan has supposedly launched T4 jets with air sampling pods to collect atmospheric data near North Korea. North Korea has said it will be putting out a statement on the event very soon. Update 11:30pm PST: First estimates from South Korea’s military postulate that this test was of a weapon with roughly a 100kt yield, roughly five times that of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Take this with a grain of salt as these estimates can change dramatically as more data becomes available. The test caused tremors in Yanji city, China: Update 11:40pm PST: North Korea has claimed they have successfully tested a thermonuclear weapon in state run media announcement. Video shows Kim Jong Un supposedly signing order to carry out the test. Here is NK state TV broadcasting the announcement live on Youtube. It is pretty much the nuttiest thing you have ever seen. Here is the full statement: NK State Media Update 12:15am PST: Here is what a 100kt weapon would look like if detonated over Pearl Harbor- Nukemap Here’s the link to Nukemap . Update 12:45am PST: South Korea says it will push the UN Security Council for sanctions that will “completely isolate” North Korea. Yonhap News also reports that South Korea will “consider deploying most powerful U.S. tactical weapons.” If this means deploying tactical nuclear weapons to bases in South Korea it would be a monumental shift in strategic policy. Update 1am PST: Here is a release from from NORSAR showing the different test seismographs plots. China has condemned the test as well. Upadte 2:40am PST: Top military commanders in US and South Korea have discussed an “effective military response” to North Korea’s nuclear test. At the same time, the South Korean government says it’s too early to declare North Korea has crossed the “red line.” President Moon Jae-in had stated that weaponizing nuclear weapons to be carried on ICBMs was that line, so it seems like North Korea hasn’t just crossed it, they leaped far past it. I got an email asking how geologists and other scientists monitor nuclear tests from afar. Here is a great writeup on exactly how this is done. Russia and Japan have also come forward to condemn the test. Still waiting on an official statement from any department in the U.S. government.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 17, 2019",This Northrop Grumman Exec Has Some Very Interesting Airplane Models On His Desk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s safe to say that Chris Hernandez, the sector vice president of research, technology and engineering at Northrop Grumman, has seen some absolutely amazing things during his career. The LA Times gave a wonderful writeup on the aerospace exec last week which included a great picture of Hernandez behind his airplane model covered desk and credenza, and some of those models are interesting to say the least. The list of projects Hernandez has worked on directly is like a highlight reel of aerospace technology developed over the last 30 or so years. Here’s just a taste from his bio on Northrop Grumman’s website: “Chris Hernandez is sector vice president of Research, Technology andEngineering at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, a premier provider of military aircraft, autonomous and space systems and next-generation solutions to assist our customers worldwide, preserve freedom and advance human discovery. In this role, Hernandez is responsible for leading the Aerospace Systems engineering organization and managing the processes and tools used to design and develop the sector’s wide array of products and programs. He also oversees NG Next, the sector’s basic research and applied technology organization, which are critical functions for our future technical development and growth and a competitive discriminator for Aerospace Systems. Previously, he served as the vice president of NG Next. Prior to that, he was vice president of Advanced Systems where he led the creation of advanced system solutions for future programs, such as next generation air dominance fighters, low observable and counter low observable systems, long-range strike and ISR systems, advanced weapons and future cargo/transport systems. He has also served as the chief technology officer and vice president, Technology Development, for Aerospace Systems’ former Advanced Programs and Technology business area. Other past positions included: vice president of Engineering and Programs for the former Integrated Systems sector; vice president and deputy of the Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle ManagementSystems business area; vice president and chief engineer of the B-2 bomber program; and vice president and program manager of the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MPRTIP). Before joining Northrop Grumman in 1987 as a project engineer, Hernandez worked forRockwell International Corporation in the development of NASA’s Space Shuttle and other advanced space launch vehicle concepts.” So yeah, what aircraft models this guy sees fit to display on his desk in his office is worth looking at, and our friend and chief of the Americas Bureau over at Flightglobal.com , Stephen Trimble, pointed this out on Friday. You can see a higher resolution version of the image in the LA Times article linked here , and the piece is also well worth reading. Off the top of my head, from top left to right and then from right to left on his desk, here’s what it looks like Hernandez has on display” Tailless tilt rotor of some sort. E-10 MC2A E-7 Wedgetail and MQ-4C Triton for Australia possibly RQ-4 Global Hawk MQ-8B Fire Scout Bat Proteus Unknown Would say F-117 if it was sitting on a Lockheed exec’s desk Northrop Grumman’s 6th generation fighter concept B-2 Spirit The “unknown” flying wing with Northrop Grumman’s signature “cranked kite” planform is interesting. It could very well be the so called RQ-180 that we understand was developed at Area 51 around the turn of the decade, and that the USAF has been flying clandestinely for some time since. This high-altitude, long endurance, deep penetrating, and long persisting unmanned aircraft is a missing link of sorts within the U.S. intelligence collection and networking ecosystem. The design is supposed to feature a very high degree of wide-band low observability (stealth) and was likely key in Northrop Grumman winning the B-21 Raider contract. There were also strong indications that a next generation bomber proof of concept was flown during the late 2000s. This could also be that aircraft if it truly existed. The tilt-rotor looking design on the far left is also puzzling. It looks like a manned aircraft—one that also appears to have stealthy features including the lack of any sort of a vertical tail. Author’s note/Update: Stephen Trimble said he was shown the model by Hernandez personally a couple of years ago and it was an early concept of Northrop Grumman’s unmanned TERN design for DARPA . It still looks different than every rendering I have seen. Here is one that is similar but its shaping in more rounded and it has a pronounced inverted “v” tail: Northrop Grumman Then again just because there is a model of an aircraft doesn’t mean it actually flew, and these mystery aircraft could have been just evolutionary steps toward current systems or developmental dead ends all together. It’s not like high-end models from official sources haven’t raised eyebrows in the past. A picture of a FB-23 model still gets passed around today in military aviation circles as a big “what if” accompanied by speculation that such an asset actually flew at some time. And this is one of many similar instances. So what do you think we are looking at here? Let us know in the comments section below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Kim Jong Un Has A Plan. We Don’t, But Here Are Our Options","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Americans return to work today after a long holiday weekend the country’s security apparatus remains hung over from days of rapidly morphing headlines regarding North Korea and its nuclear ambitions. Things have moved so fast over the last 18 months when it comes to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs that it seems as if many are in denial of just how perilous the situation has become. Above all else, the summer has underlined one cold and harsh reality—Kim Jong Un clearly has a plan and the U.S. and its allies clearly don’t. But just because we don’t have a clear strategy for taking on the Kim Regime now doesn’t mean we can’t come up with one fast, and there are plenty of options left aside from a wide scale strike on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs or all out war. North Korea’s actions over the last couple of weeks have been especially disturbing. The launch of an intermediate range ballistic missile over Japan , the showing off of new missile and nuclear warhead technologies , and then the testing of what was at least intended to be a thermonuclear weapon weren’t just run of the mill provocations from Pyongyang, they were game changing events. It’s clear that North Korea’s nuclear deterrent programs have entered into warp speed developmentally speaking. With these acts, Pyongyang has advanced the nuclear standoff with the U.S. and its allies to a point many said wouldn’t be reached. We are truly in uncharted waters now and nobody seems to be trying to put together an integrated strategy for dealing with the situation that doesn’t just feature the same old failed bag of diplomatic and military tricks. It’s as if the U.S. security apparatus is simply stunned. ""Any threat to (US) or its territories including Guam or our allies will be met with a massive military response"" pic.twitter.com/5YS4Bd855B — Sentinel (@StratSentinel) September 3, 2017 The President learned the hard way that bellicose rhetoric does nothing but encourage North Korea to redouble their weapons development efforts and to lash out in an escalating manner. It also works to help validate their own propaganda and innate paranoia. So where do we go from here? Kim Jong Un clearly has a plan as to what he aims to accomplish. Some say it is to create a grand bargaining chip, others say it is to establish a credible nuclear deterrent, while some even argue Kim has even darker goals in mind. Regardless of what his end game actually is, it primarily involves the survival of his regime. So what can be done to counter North Korea’s actions aside from the status quo lame displays of force and tough guy rhetoric? Here are the options: Sanctions People often ask what sanctions options are left at this point when it comes to North Korea? The answer is not many. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said over the weekend that “people need to cut off North Korea economically,” but that’s not nearly as easy as it sounds. Mnuchin is drafting another round of sanctions against the rogue regime at this moment and there will likely be solid support for some additional economic measures within the United Nations. But the problem is that with so few arrows left in the economic sanctions quiver, any new sanctions will impact some very big international players in some pretty nasty ways. For instance, these sanctions should and would likely include going after any company that does business with North Korea, especially within certain market sectors. Mainly these would be Chinese companies and banks, as well as some in Russia. Once again, it is highly unlikely that China and Russia would go along with these measures and the debate over such actions could spark its own diplomatic showdowns with two powerful countries that already have turbulent relations with the United States. Textiles exports are a top industry in North Korea. Banning the purchase of apparel and clothing materials from North Korea could hurt their pocketbook, but once again, this would impact China directly as they consume most of these products. Additionally, considering North Korea’s economy is growing by three to four percent a year even after all the latest sanctions, going after this one market sector alone won’t make all that much of a difference. AP North Korea’s access to energy supplies, namely oil, is likely the one remaining avenue where sanctions could have a massive impact. North Korea is largely dependent on crude oil imports from China, and without them they would have major energy shortages. Their military may be hit the hardest of all so there is a strategic impact as well when it comes to restricting oil shipments into North Korea. But going after North Korea’s energy lifeline is a risky move. Once again, the vast majority of North Korea’s crude stocks are conveyed through China and taking away their energy supply could be seen as a counter-productive move by Beijing seeing as they want to keep North Korea on its feet. Also, such a sanctions regime, if it were to go beyond just sanctioning foreign banks and companies that trade energy supplies with Pyongyang, could take enforcement on a physical level. If anything we have learned that sanctions, especially those that involve oil, lead to a more robust and creative black market. And that black market, along with the logistical network that supports it, can be used to move other goods and materials as well, including very dangerous ones. As such, sanctioning and controlling North Korea’s access to energy supplies, while having the potential to be highly effective, could require some heavy policing, including interdicting naval vessels that may be conveying illicit oil to the “Hermit Kingdom.” This brings us to our next category. Blockade The U.S., South Korea, Japan, and whoever else wants to join in as a coalition, could move to interdict all cargo coming and going from North Korea. Such an operation would be best paired with enhanced sanctions, including those against energy imports, and a U.N. resolution. Not only such an operation allow for real enforcement of harsh sanctions past and present that will actually impact Kim’s regime, but it will also surround North Korea with a coalition of coalition vessels that can turn from a policing and enforcement mission to a combat one in a blink of an eye. It will also likely allow for U.S., South Korean, and allied intelligence to interdict other contraband, including key weapons components. North Korea has poor airlift capabilities and their aircraft are easily trackable, so such an operation could even slow their weapons development programs considerably. Yes, this would be an escalation, but at least it would be a meaningful one, not just another meaningless “show of force. ” Any significant act could cause North Korea to start a conflict, but meaningful pressure combined with negotiation is more likely to push Kim to the negotiating table than the status quo. And that brings us to our next category. South Korean ships execute live fire drills following North Korea’s 6th nuclear weapons test. , AP Negotiation The backchannel, half measured, multi-national negotiation tactics of the past don’t work. The President should call on Kim Jong Un for unilateral top-level negotiations at a neutral site, like he once said he as going to do . The U.S. should be willing to accept a freeze of all North Korean missile and nuclear tests, as well as missile and nuclear weapons production in a verifiable manner, with a roadmap to deescalation and enhanced relations for all parties. We have discussed this in detail before , but the idea that Kim will hand over his nuclear weapons and missiles as part of some deal is lunacy—it will never happen. It is expecting full capitulation by choice not by necessity, and Kim knows full well what happens to dictators who play ball with the U.S. in this fashion (see Muammar Gaddafi). But freezing Kim’s arsenal and keeping close tabs on it would be a worthwhile compromise, especially if a pathway towards deescalation and more normalized relations with Pyongyang underpin such a deal. Once again, the Trump Administration has stated as late as today that denuclearization would be the only outcome that would be acceptable via negotiations, so this is a non-starter. Clear Messaging And Ultimatums The fact that the U.S. has no plan to deal with the North Korean crisis beyond a war plan if hostilities were to erupt physically is made clear by the vague rhetoric put forward by Washington. This isn’t just Trump’s problem, the Obama Administration—which largely ignored the North Korean problem while it festered—was also a repeat offender. Clear and defined messaging that includes consequences for certain acts could alter North Korea’s current trajectory, but it comes at great risk as such statements have to be backed with actual force. For instance, giving North Korea a defined series of red lines and the consequences of stepping over them would be a good place to start. First off, clearly stating that any attempted use of a nuclear weapon against the U.S. or its allies would result in an overwhelming nuclear counterstrike by the U.S.—one that would result in the definitive end of the Kim regime—could be one place to start. Kim Jong Un giving orders to execute the country’s sixth nuclear test. , AP Making it clear that any major conflict, either nuclear or conventional, between North and South Korea would result in the instant orders to eradicate the Kim regime and that America’s “unique” capabilities will be brought to bear to make sure this occurs in short order could also blunt North Korea’s aggression. Other detailed warnings, like stating that their entire submarine fleet will be sunk if they sink one allied ship, could also be put forward, and so on. The U.S. and its allies could also state that any further IRBM and ICBM tests would be destroyed preemptively or during flight as seen fit. Striking these missiles while they are being fueled is doable, but it would mean the introduction of kinetic strikes on North Korean soil—a move that could very well lead to full scale war. Striking them down during flight is possible under certain circumstances, but not in a reliable fashion, although it is a far less risky option. This brings us to our next category. Enhanced Missile Defenses Oftentimes people ask why we don’t just shoot down North Korea’s missile tests. The reason is that it’s not always certain that we have assets in the right place to engage these missiles and some missiles aren’t even within our reach. Additionally, America’s ballistic missile defense ecosystem has performed better in testing, but it is no way a highly reliable system. Trying to shoot down North Korean missiles and missing would have broad strategic implications and could highlight operational weaknesses in operational missile defense systems. Currently the only system that is built to shoot down an ICBM is the ground-based missile defense interceptor system based in Alaska . Kim would have to attack the U.S., or come closer to doing it, for these interceptors to have a chance at engaging such a target. Aside from the IRBM that overflew Japan last month, North Korea uses steep parabolic trajectories to test their missiles. Our ship-based Aegis missile defense systems are not set up to deal with this type of target and the THAAD battery already setup in South Korea has a limited engagement zone that puts missiles flying outside of South Korea’s borders largely beyond their engagement capabilities. If anything, it may be possible to shoot down these missiles during their reentry phase, but by that time much of the useful data would have been collected by North Korean scientists. A ballistic missile is fired from Kauai during a missile defense test. , MDA The installation of permanent Aegis Ashore sites in Japan would help with missile defense and for shooting down North Korean test missiles up to the IRBM class. In addition, making sure Japan gets the latest Aegis Ashore subsystems, including both SM-3 missiles for mid-course intercept and SM-6 missiles for terminal intercept, as well as the new SPY-6 radar to guide them, is key. Stationing Aegis BMD capable surface combatants between North Korean and Guam would also provide the ability to shoot down IRBMs that fly traditional down-range trajectories during their mid-course phase of flight. Guam has a THAAD battery, but the system is used primarily to engage missile threats during their terminal phase of attack. A far more elaborate missile defense plan may be in order based on recent developments—one that would see ground based missile defense interceptors be stationed in new locations, like Guam and Hawaii. Hawaii is particular is alarmingly vulnerable to a North Korean missile attack. Considering its strategic importance and history when it comes to surprise attacks, installing ground-based ICBM interceptors there seems like a smart move. If they can be adapted to engage ICBM targets earlier during their mid-course phase, even placing these missiles on Guam would make sense as well. Regardless of the cost, this “layered” ICBM defense system could help neutralize Kim’s arsenal at least for the foreseeable future. Such an expansion of anti-ballistic missile capabilities would come at a very high cost, and it will surely enrage China and Russia, but it is one thing the U.S. and its allies could do if we are to settle into a long-term nuclear standoff with the Kim regime. Forward Deploy Tactical Nukes Bringing tactical nuclear weapons to the region would be a bold and somewhat depressing move by the U.S., but it could be seen as a very real and persistent deterrent against North Korean aggression. South Korea had hosted U.S. tactical nuclear weapons up until 1991 , when the decision to withdraw them was made to entice the North Koreans into agreeing to nuclear inspections. Bringing those weapons back to South Korea, where they could be deployed on short notice, would send a very strong signal to Pyongyang, but doing so is not without drawbacks. Weapons Storage and Security System vault in its up position and holding a B61 tactical nuclear bomb. , DoD When it comes to nuclear weapons proliferation and arms control, redeploying nuclear weapons to a denuclearized country sure isn’t seen as a step in a positive direction. Also they could serve only to fuel North Korea’s paranoia and thus their own nuclear arms programs. The weapons are costly to deploy and training crews to employ them is also a major commitment. In addition, neighboring countries, including China and Russia, may have strong objection to their presence. Tensions would also elevate on the Peninsula as a result of their presence and mistakes can be easily made. In North Korea’s eyes any U.S. fighter could be a nuclear threat, which would lighten the North’s already twitchy trigger finger. Deterrence has to be coupled with a willingness to use the weapons. If the US puts tactical nukes back in to South Korea, the implication is that commanders have to be ready to use them and we don’t have a “no first use” policy. But even with these concerns, moving nuclear weapons back onto the Korean Peninsula may be one of the last major non-kinetic military responses the U.S. has left to offer. And considering we have them sitting in Turkey , they are actually safer in South Korea than there. There is also the possibility of having South Korea field their own nuclear weapons in the form of a submarine-launched second-strike deterrent . This has long been viewed as a highly unwanted development by most in the past by most security and arms control experts, but hardliners in South Korea are already demanding it, and popular opinion could begin to change in light of recent developments. Doing so could be a first step to a nuclear arms race in the region, but South Korea has a right to defend itself and Donald Trump has even floated the idea in the past. Cyber Warfare And Electronic Attacks Executing cyber attacks on North Korea would have limited impact as the country is not as reliant on the internet—and computers overall for that matter—as most nations. Also, North Korea has some very capable cyber capabilities of its own , ones that could potentially wreak far more havoc on the United States and its allies than vice-versa. With this in mind, instigating a cyber war against North Korea seems like a strategy with limited upside and a lot of downside. Still, limited clandestine and masked attacks on regime and military related cyber targets may be worthwhile in concert with other measures. It is doubtful that these tactics have not already been deployed, especially those targeting North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. EC-130J Commando Solo could provide standoff electronic attacks against North Korea’s weapons development communications infrastructure. , USAF The application of electronic warfare may limit North Korea’s ability to monitor and gain data from its missile and nuclear tests, but jamming line-of-sight data links may be troublesome and having aircraft airborne and ready to scramble these transmissions at the time of a tests would be a big logistical undertaking. Still, if these challenges could be overcome, this may be one non-invasive measure that could slow North Korea’s nuclear and missile development. Psychological Warfare Campaign One thing the Kim regime is known to despise is psychological operations aimed at shattering North Koreans’ programmatic and largely farcical view of their society, culture, and their general place in the world. The broadcasting of South Korean soap operas and K-pop music via loudspeaker across the DMZ, along with messages that dispel myths perpetrated by the regime, has almost brought the two sides to war in the recent past . These broadcasts, along with airborne radio broadcasts, and even literature dropped into North Korean territory by balloon, could antagonize the Kim regime and serve to undermine their propaganda. The status quo isn’t a plan at all The fact of the matter is that any new measures brought against North Korea, military or otherwise, involve risk, some of them far more than others. But the alternative of just doing nothing and sticking with the status quo—a battle the U.S. and its allies are losing—isn’t just a poor plan, it isn’t a plan at all. Flying bombers toward North Korea as photo ops and warning the Kim regime of red lines that keep being skipped over via tough-guy rhetoric is becoming embarrassingly futile and it harms the credibility of the United States. It’s also unlikely that any one of these options alone will bring a positive end to hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, but a cocktail of them, with each measure being executed along with clear, concise, and honest messaging could very well work in America’s favor. But once again, none of this matters if the only solution the Trump Administration will accept is total capitulation by the North Koreans and the turning over of all their nuclear weapons and missiles. This is a fantasy, and this type of rigid thinking will either lead to a long term standoff with the U.S. and its allies having to live with an ever increasing North Korean nuclear weapons and missile arsenal, both in terms of size and capability, or an outright war. If war is truly the only solution, which I don’t believe is the case by any means, than it is better to get it over with sooner or than later as Kim’s hand grows stronger by the day. Although the death toll and level of destruction would be immense, the rebuilding program that comes after would likely be a far greater challenge than the war itself. North Korea State Media Sustaining and stabilizing a semi-starving and totally brainwashed populous of 25 million, who already live in a country with crumbling infrastructure before a war, will be a generational project that will make Iraq look like a sideshow. Everything from a deadly insurgency to an entire region stunned by war will be just a couple of the obstacles that will likely be faced after the initial combat phase has ended. The cost of such a project would also be so large it is hard to even fathom. And there are real chances that such a war could lead to a wider conflict—one involving China. Maybe the most troubling part of all this is that it seems we are becoming totally desensitized to the North Korean threat. Sure it’s scary, but it seems that even those in power just shrug, make empty threats, and moves on with their day. But this will catch up with us in a very nasty way if left unchecked. We must confront the issue now creatively using a multi-pronged comprehensive strategy. At least this way if war comes to the Korean Peninsula we would know that we did everything we could to avoid it while still looking out for our own interests and for those of our allies in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2017","Fleeing F-5 Fighters, Devastated Airports, And Packed Hangars As Irma Slams Caribbean","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What is being deemed as the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, Irma is wreaking havoc on the Caribbean, and to everyone’s dismay it looks as if it has Florida squarely in its sights next. One of the most beloved and famous airports in the world, Princess Juliana International on St. Maarten, has been badly damaged by the hurricane. Images of the devastation are just trickling in and they aren’t pretty to say the least. Winds reached 185mph at the airport sending objects flying into critical infrastructure. Supposedly sand has covered portions of the runway and flooding is prevalent due to the torrential rains brought by the storm. St. Maarten has been ravaged by Irma. Widespread flooding and massive damage to structures all over the island have been reported. , AP Little Maho Beach, where all the amazing pictures of planes taking off and landing are taken, is said to have been largely destroyed. Most of the aircraft that could fly have tried to escape the incoming storm, but the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Patrol in Puerto Rico have sheltered in place. Check out the super packed hangar at Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen. Good luck to these guys and gals and their gear which will be crucial when it comes to saving lives after the storm has done its damage. Just to give you an idea of how bad the damage on Puerto Rico is expected to be, the utility company is saying that residents shouldn’t expect power for up to half a year. Meanwhile, at Guantanamo in Cuba , sailors and troops stationed there have been ordered to shelter in place. Non essential personnel could evacuate at their own cost. Those housed in temporary trailer-like units have been relocated to the base gym. The detention center located there is especially vulnerable to storms, and supposedly the few dozen prisoners still incarcerated there have been moved to a more secure location. If the base’s detention center is badly damaged during the storm it isn’t clear where the prisoners would go for long term holding as they cannot step foot on American soil. Some of the troops stationed at Guantanamo Bay are sheltering in the base’s gym., DoD At this time it looks like Irma will pass on the northern side of Cuba, which could spare Guantanamo from its most powerful winds and storm surges. But this track is not good news for Florida’s coasts. The models are beginning to narrow now and it looks unlikely that Florida will be spared from the brunt of the storm. Making landfall around Florida’s Southern tip after passing over the Florida Keys, Irma’s eye could track along Florida’s east coast, putting Miami right in its crosshairs, with the Space Coast , Mayport , and Jacksonville, along with many other towns, also being put in great danger. If the storm takes a hard turn to the north a bit later, it could devastate Key West and go on to impact Naples, Tampa, and the Florida Panhandle. Either way, multiple key military installations could be drastically impacted by the storm. Florida declared an emergency a couple days ago and the Navy is evacuating all non essential personnel from NAS Key West to Atlanta, Georgia. The base’s F-5 aggressors belonging to VFC-111 are also fleeing from the storm. 15 of the squadron’s 17 jets could fly, and one of the base’s two SAR helicopters could also escape. Similar evacuations are likely to occur for air and naval bases on Florida’s mainland in the coming hours. On the east coast, Homestead AFB, Patrick AFB, Naval Base Mayport, NAS Jacksonville, and Jacksonville Air National Guard Base are just some of the installations that could be impacted. On the west coast, MacDill AFB, Hurlburt Field, Eglin AFB, Tyndall AFB, and NAS Pensacola could all be affected to varying degrees. The Coast Guard also has extensive facilities and assets in the state. Some of these bases have large inventories of aircraft and if they were to require evacuation the sudden migration to safe havens to the north would be large in scale to say the least. The Navy is also putting the two amphibious assault ships, USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill , which it deployed from Norfolk, Virginia to the Texas Gulf Coast following Hurricane Harvey, on alert for redeployment to Florida’s coast if FEMA requests their assistance. With the hurricane expected to hit Florida this weekend, Space-X and the USAF are going to try to get the X-37B’ s fifth mission underway before the storm hits the Space Coast. Two launch windows of roughly six hours open mid day on Thursday and Friday but weather could keep the launch from occurring. On Thursday there is a 50% chance of good weather, while on Friday there is only a 40% chance. If the space plane can’t get into orbit by then it will have to ride out the storm at Cape Canaveral. This is the first time Space-X has attempted to launch an X-37B. Helping to better predict where this storm will end up making landfall are the flying Hurricane Hunters, specifically those of NOAA who use their WP-3D Orions to punch through the storm and their Gulfstream IV to fly over it. The USAF’s WC-130J is also active in Irma. Some awesome video of just what the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record looks like from the inside have been posted by NOAA’s crews and they are pretty dramatic. Finally, we have this brave or crazy Delta 737 crew that flew into the leading bands of the hurricane to land in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It isn’t clear exactly how or why this flight went where others wouldn’t at this time, but it made it down safely and got back in the air less than an hour later, weaving through the outer bands of the storm on its way north! We will keep you updated as the storm approaches Florida and as evacuation plans expand.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 7, 2017",DARPA’s “Flying Missile Rail” Seems To Be More About Manufacturing Than Combat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has published its plan for a rapidly manufactured “Flying Missile Rail” drone that can be launched off the wing of a tactical jet. The concept sounds strange, and to some degree it is, but its existence could help underline the fact that unmanned systems can break the current bloated and slow tactical aircraft procurement model that is failing under its own weight. It also speaks to some larger concepts and questions as to the Pentagon’s grand unmanned strategy—or lack thereof. The Flying Missile Rail concept is explained in a pitch reel of sorts from DARPA presented by USAF Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Jones of the Strategic Technologies Office, a unit that seems to be focused on the Pentagon’s shadowy third offset strategy initiative. The group is officially described as “seeking applications to develop disruptive technologies that will improve systems and capabilities.” Strangely enough, the renderings of the Flying Missile Rail concept look very similar to a certain model that was spotted on a Northrop Grumman executive’s credenza recently. It is unclear if there is some relation or if it is just a fluke. The idea behind the concept is really two fold. First off it has to do with creating a low-end “attritable” unmanned system that has a single purpose—to launch an AIM-120 air-to-air missile either while still attached to a host aircraft or by being launched from that host aircraft and flying for 20 minutes along a series of waypoints and launching the missile on command from a remote location. If the system is launched from an aircraft or if it fires a missile it would not be reusable. If it can hold and fire more than one AIM-120 missile that is a plus, but not a requirement. DARPA The second and maybe the most important aspect of the program is not about what the system can do as much as how it is designed and produced. The goal is to prove that the increasingly damning super long design, testing, and production cycle of modern flying combat systems can be broken. This would be done by leveraging rapid design, prototyping, and manufacturing processes with an aim of producing 500 of these systems in a single month . Obviously the strategic impact of being able to produce weapon systems or even guided munitions on such an elastic basis would be a huge breakthrough fiscally and logistically, and it would be especially impactful during a time of sustained conflict. DARPA As Flying Missile Rail program manager Lieutenant Colonel Jones says, the concept takes the status quo question of “here’s what I want, how fast can I get it?” and changes it to “here’s how fast I want it, what can I get?” This more agile style of procurement that leverages the latest in manufacturing techniques would allow for far more flexible production and enhanced innovation. In other words, for the dollars spent, the capabilities purchased could be better adapted to the threat faced in the near-term. DARPA DARPA Here is the entire DARPA presentation video for the Flying Missile Rail: The concepts behind the Flying Missile Rail program really aren’t anything new, but the fact that the Pentagon is more openly acting on their potential is, especially in terms of producing weapons with fairly complex capabilities. At its heart, at least capabilities wise, the Flying Missile Rail isn’t a high-end semi-autonomous drone. The inherent advantages of unmanned combat aircraft systems, especially semi-autonomous and autonomous ones, are numerous compared to their manned counterparts. The War Zone detailed these advantages in our expose “The Alarming Case of the USAF’s Mysteriously Missing Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles” linked here , a few of which seem to be the underpinnings of DARPA’s Flying Missile Rail initiative: They are more disposable: You don’t have to build a UCAV to fly 8,000 hours as with manned fighter aircraft, a requirement that adds significantly to an aircraft’s unit and development costs. Instead UCAVs can be designed to last a fraction of that flight time. The reason for this is that these aircraft don’t have to fly anywhere near as much as their manned counterparts. Nobody really has to train to fly them at all. Computer simulations and modelling, a strong centralized test and development effort, and intermittent large-scale air combat exercises will be essential in proving new UCAV tactics and to certify the systems as effective, but beyond that these things can largely sit in a hangar and wait for combat. The days of putting hundreds of hours on a tactical jet airframe a year would be over. As a result, a UCAV could be designed to last a couple thousands hours of flight time or even far less. UCAV design and procurement can rapidly adapt to changing tactical realities: Since they don’t have to have an 8,000 plus flight hour lifespan that will be spread over many decades, new UCAVs with enhanced design features and better low observable qualities can be bought on a regular basis. Such a concept also has the potential to greatly smooth the USAF’s notoriously disgraceful and unsustainable big-ticket weapons procurement process. Instead of buying an entirely new fighter jet every couple of decades, the service can constantly buy far cheaper UCAV designs in tranches of ever increasing capabilities tailored to match emerging threats in near real-time. This type of procurement concept allows for a far more nimble response to changing tactical challenges, and in doing so it puts America’s potential enemies at a drastically greater disadvantage when it comes to trying to counter our own capabilities. As UCAVs evolve, older units can be re-roled to perform non “tip of the spear” but still essential duties. These include tanking, acting as communication relays, flying data fusion centers, surveillance platforms, and acting as arsenal ships for troops on the ground in lower-threat combat environments. In other words, commanders can use their newest, most updated UCAVs for kicking down the enemy’s door while also using older systems to fulfill other critical but less risky missions where a UCAV’s persistence is still a big plus. In the end, a UCAV, no matter how stealthy or advanced it is, is still capable of staying aloft for hours with a relatively large payload. As such, older designs will have many uses even after their “first day of war” utility is degraded by the passage of time. They are expendible UCAVs can be ordered to fly into the most dangerous airspace in the world without the potential loss of aircrew being a factor, which can have huge political ramifications both abroad and at home. This also means commanders can take greater risks with greater potential rewards during conflicts and can more freely strike at the heart of the enemy’s ability to wage war. For instance, instead of very slowly breaking down the bad guys’ area denial and anti-access capabilities from long-ranges using expensive standoff munitions, massive swarms of UCAVs can execute direct attacks on key anti-air warfare targets. UCAV’s far lower unit cost and simpler manufacturing process, one that can make the most of large composite structures and 3D printing, also means they can be replaced more efficiently than manned aircraft. In other words, UCAVs can speed up an air campaign’s intended results compared to manned systems, while doing so at far lower risk. With these attributes in mind, it seems like DARPA has pulled a capability set that is relevant to the increasingly popular “attritable” or “tethered” unmanned aircraft concept—where a drone acts as a combat aircraft’s slaved wingman or arsenal ship—and paired it with a very nimble procurement and manufacturing concept. In this case, the manufacturing concept is clearly more important than the military capability being tested and manufactured. It seems that the Pentagon has become obsessed with the idea of expendable or semi-expendable and relatively cheap unmanned combat air vehicles. Undoubtedly they could have a meaningful place in future conflicts. Kratos has three of these concepts far along in development, one of which also uses the “loyal wingman” concept , and another is a semi-expendable unmanned combat air vehicle , while yet another is classified. There are other similar programs underway as well, including far lower-end drones with swarming capabilities. But as we have pointed out multiple times before , there is zero discussion about higher-end unmanned combat air vehicles—ones that could do the job of manned assets and in many cases do that job far more efficiently and reliably and with much lower risk. Over the last decade, other countries’ UCAV programs have progressed, while the USAF acts as if the technology doesn’t even exist. Here is the European consortium led by Dassault’s nEuron UCAV demonstrator escorted by a Rafale. , AP At the same time, rapid prototyping, 3D printing, and the production of large seamless composite structures have come a long way in the last decade or so, and it’s not as if the same style of manufacturing that DARPA outlaid above couldn’t be adapted today to larger and more complex unmanned air vehicle systems. In fact we know some of it already has. Lockheed used these technologies to build its still somewhat mysterious P175 Polecat demonstrator in the early 2000s, and the shadowy RQ-170 clearly benefits from them as well. Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Atomics also have gained massive insight and capabilities in this space. So leveraging some of these same manufacturing techniques and concepts to build a large fleet of advanced UCAVs seems like low hanging fruit at this point for the USAF and its primary vendors and not something that has to be proven through a DARPA program. But once again, the Air Force largely acts as if the UCAV concept doesn’t even exist. Instead it is concentrated on low-end and watered-down variations of it—at least publicly. We have speculated extensively on why this is the case, especially since the technology was proven to be game changing nearly a decade and a half ago: “ The idea that the USAF has chosen not to procured UCAV technology in any sort of meaningful scale at all, beyond maybe some classified technology demonstrators, even a decade after the UCAV’s potential was so brilliantly demonstrated by the X-45s, sounds so troubling it borders on shameful. Yet the USAF has, to put it far too nicely, struggled greatly when it comes to integrating unmanned programs into its flyboy dominated culture. The idea that an unmanned system could make at least some of the USAF’s manned tactical aircraft totally obsolete, even before they are built, strikes right at the heart of the USAF’s fighter pilot cabal. With this in mind, could the Air Force brass have stubbornly kept UCAVs at bay in order to protect the role of aircrews within the flying service? Especially considering that this new technology could directly threaten not only the biggest weapons program of all time, the F-35, but the last manned fighter the USAF may ever actually buy. Given the evidence, or lack thereof, It seems possible… …Either the USAF has a secret UCAV capability, but only in relatively tiny numbers, which handicaps many of the concept’s innate advantages, or the alternative is even worse; the USAF has not pursued the technology to any significant degree at all. Even if the better of these two possible realities is true, the veil of secrecy surrounding such a classified UCAV program has likely resulted in highly skewed procurement and strategic decisions that we may not be able to recover from for many decades. In the end both theories result in a nation that is less well defended than it would be with a large-scale and disclosed UCAV program underway and the longer this game-changing technology remains buried or undeveloped for whatever reason, the worse off America will be.” While DARPA should be applauded for pursuing a program like the Flying Missile Rail, it seems very strange that we are just now experimenting with the design and production concepts behind it. It almost seems as if we are now seeing concepts that have been leveraged for classified programs for some time. Then again, the scale of units the Flying Missile Rail program aims to produce as a proof of concept is likely beyond anything that has occurred in the shadows of the black budget. If that’s the case, that goal alone is well worth DARPA’s effort. Regardless, hopefully the program will be a success and prove publicly that the old way of procuring certain air combat capabilities represents a losing strategy, and that modular and ever more complex unmanned systems produced using agile and flexible manufacturing techniques is truly the way forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2017",USAF Has Dispatched Its Air Sprayer C-130s To Texas In Response To Hurricane Harvey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. C-130Hs from the Air Force Reserve’s 910th Airlift Wing are headed to Texas in response to Hurricane Harvey. The unit has a special aerial spraying capability that is going to be put to use to help with minimizing the impact of the brutal storm’s aftermath. The aircraft and their crews are based out of Youngstown, Ohio and they are the only aerial spraying capable unit in the Air Force—a function few probably even realize the Pentagon has in its portfolio. The ability to spray large swathes of land or water with various chemicals can be used for multiple applications, including dispersing oil spills, destroying invasive vegetation, and controlling insect populations. The whole “chemtrail” crowd will probably be very concerned with the news that these aircraft will be heading to Texas, but their mission there is crystal clear. 910th Air Mobility Wing C-130H executing oil dispersal operations over water. , USAF Because there is so much standing and heavily polluted water around Houston and other areas affected by the storm, insects populations are bound to explode, which poses a major health risk to the population of southeastern Texas and the first responders working to get the area back on its feet. Mosquitoes that can carry and transmit malaria, west nile virus, zika, and multiple types of encephalitis will be the target of the operation. Supposedly the C-130s will treat over six million acres of land while dispatched to the region, far more territory than in previous post-hurricane operations. Four C-130Hs and 70 airmen should be arriving at Lackland AFB today and will immediately begin spraying operations. With recent night vision goggle training, Herkybird crews can safely spray at low-level around the clock, and considering that nighttime is when mosquitoes are most active, spraying at after the sun goes down makes the most sense. The Modular Aerial Spray System installed in the cargo hold of a C-130., USAF Each C-130H equipped with a Modular Aerial Spray System (MASS) can spray a whopping 190,000 acres per day, although that is a maximum number and normal operations will likely be a little less aggressive. According to the USAF: “The 910th’s customized Modular Aerial Spray System is capable of a wide-variety of applications. For mosquito control, the system uses the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved and regulated material naled, which is not used in amounts large enough to cause any concern for human health, according to the EPA. The system disperses droplets small enough to land on a mosquito’s wing, using less than one ounce of naled per acre. That’s less than one shot glass for an area the size of a football field.” USAF MASS is an entirely different system than the C-130’s Modular Aerial Fire Fighting System (MAFS) . Instead of blasting out short strings of slurry  or water on fires, MASS atomizes the chemical compounds it is spraying and can cover a massive amount of territory with its two modular chemical tanks held in the C-130’s cargo bay. The 910th Air Mobility Wing has eight C-130H aircraft and one in reserve, and as of 2014 they have six MASS units. With Hurricane Irma about to plow into what looks like all of Florida, their spraying capabilities will likely be needed there as well in the near future. Florida is already notorious for its mosquitoes, but once Irma dumps millions of gallons of water onto the state, rapid infestation is almost a certainty. If anything else, this mission is yet another reminder of the ever increasing and downright bewildering list of missions the C-130 Hercules can be adapted to accomplish. So if you live in Texas, don’t be alarmed if you see and hear a big C-130 roaring by at very low level while dumping something into the air behind it. It’s just the Air Force waging war on a microscopic level against an insect enemy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 8, 2019",USAF Reveals Mysterious Crash Occurred Just A Day Before Two A-10s Crashed In Same Area,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two A-10 Warthogs crashed at around 8pm Wednesday evening while on a training mission over the expansive Nevada Test and Training Range in southern Nevada. Thankfully both pilots made it out alive from that incident but the exact circumstances surrounding it remain unknown. Now the USAF has noted that yet another previously undisclosed crash occurred on the range just a day before, at around 6pm on September 5th. This crash seems more mysterious outright as it took the life of an experienced test pilot and the type of aircraft involved in the mishap remains undisclosed. All we know is that it belonged to the Air Force Material Command. The pilot that died in the tragic incident has been listed as Lt. Col. Eric Schultz. Schultz was a civilian flight engineer before joining the USAF in 2001 and his dream was to become an astronaut. You can read all about the unique path he took to realize his fighter jet flying dream here . Schultz graduated from the USAF’s elite Test Pilot School i n 2008 . In 2011 he become the 28th pilot to fly the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and participated in the test program during its darkest developmental period to date. This was a very experienced and professional aviator to say the least and his death is a huge loss to the USAF, let alone his family and friends. The crash is said to have occurred roughly 100 miles north of Las Vegas, deep within the Nevada Test and Training Range . The fact that the aircraft was owned by the Air Force Material Command likely means that it was likely a test aircraft, which could be anything from an F-16 to an F-35s to a exotic and highly classified test article to a foreign fighter jet. The fact that the USAF won’t disclose the type of aircraft involved in the mishap is somewhat of a red flag and points to the possibility that the airframe could have been sensitive in nature. As for the F-35, those based at Nellis AFB are owned by Air Combat Command, but F-35s based at Edwards AFB are largely owned by Air Force Material Command. These aircraft can and do use the Nellis Range Complex for testing purposes. It remains unclear what program or unit Schultz was assigned to when the crash occurred. Finlay McWalter/wikicommons Obviously Area 51 and Tonopah Test Range Airport are both in the vicinity of where the crash supposedly occurred. Both installations are legendary for their classified aircraft programs. The delay in the disclosure of the crash could have been due to the sensitive nature of what was being flown and from where. That combined with the pilot’s skills and what command owned the aircraft being tested, make the mishap suspicious. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Why The Navy’s Top Spy Submarine Flew A Pirate Flag While Pulling Into Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have been barraged with messages asking for an explanation as to why an American nuclear submarine would be flying a big black pirate flag as it pulled into its home port. The black flag with a skull embossed on it is commonly known as the Jolly Roger. It has been made famous by countless stories of swashbuckling pirates who used it to strike fear in the hearts of sailors aboard ships that were about to be commandeer. The Jolly Roger plays to an even greater symbology in which a monotoned skull and crossbones serves as a warning for impending danger and death. But when it comes to America’s most capable and versatile nuclear submarine—a vessel used for espionage and spying of the grandest order—the Jolly Roger holds a very different meaning. On September 11th, 2017 the Navy released images of the USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23)—the Navy’s one-off, heavily modified Seawolf class nuclear fast attack submarine—as it made its way through the Hood Canal on its way back to its home port at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in Washington State. Flying from the boat’s conning tower was a big Jolly Roger flag. Its peculiar presence set off a round of inquiries as to its meaning. USS Jimmy Carter as she heads toward her home port at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor. , USN The Jimmy Carter is the last of only three Seawolf class submarines ever built, but its hullform is different than its sister ships. During construction, it had a large plug placed in the center of its hull, making the boat substantially longer than the other two Seawolf class boats. This plug accommodates room for lockout chambers, underwater remotely operated vehicles, and cargo bays for delivering and retrieving outsized cargo. A slew of other modifications were also made to the vessel. You can read all about them, as well as about the Jimmy Carter in general, in this prior feature profile I wrote about the submarine. Suffice it to say that the USS Jimmy Carter’s primary mission is espionage and spying. It can manipulate communications cables deep under the surface of the ocean and even locate and retrieve sensitive material sitting on the sea floor. It truly is America’s ultimate spying tool, and it can still hunt and fight like a normal Seawolf class fast attack submarine if it has to. USS Jimmy Carter plowing through Washington waters. You can see the large missionized extension plug placed in the center of the boat’s hull. , USN The use of the Jolly Roger on submarines originated from British maritime heritage. The whole concept is said to have been the result of a statement made by Admiral Arthur Wilson , the First Sea Lord of the British Royal Navy, in the year 1901—just as submarines started to proliferate in numbers among some of the world’s most powerful navies. The Admiral stated in disgust that submarines were “underhanded, unfair and damned un-English!” He continued to proclaim that he would persuade the Royal Navy brass to have crews of hostile submarines captured and hanged just as they would do to pirates. Nearly a decade and a half later, during World War I, the British submarine HMS E9 sunk a German cruiser while on patrol. Commander Max Horton of the E9 ordered his crew to whip up a Jolly Roger—basically a pirate flag—and flew the ominous pennant proudly atop the E9’s sail as it triumphantly pulled back into port. It was a play on the admiral’s famous statement regarding the unique “spirit” and mission of military submariners. They embraced the pirate mascot wholeheartedly as it wasn’t their job to be noble, it was to be effective and deadly. This became a high-profile tradition for the crew, and after every successful patrol they would make and hang an additional Jolly Roger until there was no room left to fly any more. As a result of the lack of space on the submarine’s mast, a far larger flag was crafted, and not only did it feature the skull and crossbones, but it also would have a bar for each enemy vessel E9 sent to a watery grave. HMS E9. , Public Domain HMS E9’s seemingly strange but intriguing tradition caught on fast with other submarine crews as well. British submarines started adding their own colors and modifications to their Jolly Rogers. Command after command was given from on high to cease the non-standard practice but those demands went unacknowledged and the Jolly Roger become a symbol of a submarine crew’s more independent spirit and capacity for guile compared to their surface fleet counterparts. The practice became widespread once again during World War II after HMS Osiris ventured deep into the highly guarded waters of the Adriatic and sunk the Italian destroyer Palestro . When the Osiris returned victorious to Alexandria from what seemed like a suicide mission she was ordered to wait outside submarine nets for a special package that would be delivered from the 1st Submarine Group commander’s tender. The box was brought to the waiting sub and in it was a black pirate flag. The gift was a “recognition signal” to denote the crew’s brave and highly successful mission. The Osiris’s crew hoisted the Jolly Roger high above their conning tower and gallantly strode into her berth. HMS Safari’s Jolly Roger as seen during World War II. , AP Soon after, British submarines would be assigned a Jolly Roger flag after their first successful patrol. These flags would also act as an unofficial record of sorts of their achievements via the sowing on of various symbols representing different actions. The flag was only allowed to flown if the submarine returned from a successful sortie. In essence they became something akin to nose art and kill markings for Britain’s wartime undersea service. Left to right: 1.) Polish submarine ORP Sokół returning to base in 1944 with their Jolly Roger and Nazi flags from ships they sunk risen high. 2.) Sailor from HMS Taku adds mission markings to the ship’s Jolly Roger. 3.) Officers of HMS Ursula stand in front of their Jolly Roger., Republic of Poland/Imperial War Museum/Wikicommons The tradition was carried forward through the decades, with boats like HMS Conqueror flying the Jolly Roger upon a triumphant return to port following the Falklands War. The flag was adorned with the shape of a cruiser to denote her successful torpedo attack on the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano . Jolly Rogers were flown from British submarines following Desert Storm and the second Gulf War as well. Silhouettes of tomahawk axes on the Jolly Rogers of Royal Navy submarines that fired BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles in anger during patrols have become staples following coalition operations abroad. Britain’s Royal Navy Commander Rob Dunn holds a Jolly Roger flag on HMS Triumph as she sails back into Davenport, Plymouth, Devon, England, Saturday, April 2, 2011 after taking part in operations in the Libya where she fired sea to land Tomahawk cruise missiles. , AP Foreign submarine services have also adopted the lore and meaning of the Jolly Roger dating as far back as World War II—largely a product of working alongside their British counterparts. Even some surface vessels had flown the iconic flag for similar purposes. Fast forward to today and the Jolly Roger remains somewhat of an inside symbol among submarine crews, and some American submarines have been known to fly it in the past. Although, the USS Jimmy Carter , whose missions are among the most highly classified in the entire “Silent Service” seems to have a special affinity for the tradition. The boat was seen flying the Jolly Roger following another patrol last April. Some of the symbols that can adorn a submarine’s Jolly Roger and what they mean. , navynews.co.uk The Jimmy Carter’s iteration of the flag uses the crossed swords instead of the crossed bones. This could reflect the vessel’s “cloak and dagger” secret mission set or it could be just what was available when the flag was procured. It’s unclear if any other symbology appears on the Jimmy Carter’s Jolly Roger, but we are looking into it. Also it’s worth noting that other unique naval symbology is used by vessels in a similar fashion from time to time, such as raising a broom up high on a ship or submarine’s mast. This indicates the crew and the vessel made a “clean sweep” of their mission or task. This may include executing a perfect patrol, successfully completing sea trials without issue, or even launching all of a ship’s armament in combat. USN As for what the enhanced Seawolf class submarine was up to that garnered the adornment of the Jolly Roger, we will probably never know. It could have been splicing into a communications cable inside unfriendly territory or recovering pieces of a North Korean ballistic missile off the sea floor—it’s up to your own imagination to think of the possibilities. Regardless, it’s safe to say that whatever it was actually up to, it was likely very important, highly sensitive, and dangerous work. Considering the reputation of the USS Jimmy Carter , a boat that is supposed to have a crew made up of some of the best submariners ever assembled, this likely won’t be the last we will see of its big pirate flag.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 22, 2017",Here’s The Definitive Account Of The Syrian Su-22 Shoot Down From The Pilots Themselves,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Tailhook Association’s annual symposium wrapped up on Sunday and the event featured a special panel this year—the quartet of Hornet and Super Hornet pilots who were involved in the mission that resulted in the shooting down of a Syrian Su-22 Fitter. Their detailed account of the historic mission provides by far the most concise and thorough picture of not just the engagement itself, but what came before it and after. It also offers some unique insights into the complex air war over Syria. Below is a summary and some of the takeaways based on the combined accounts of not just Lt. Cmdr. Michael “Mob” Tremel who shot down the Syrian Fitter, but also of his wingman from VFA-87 “Golden Warriors” and two pilots who flew a section of F/A-18Cs belonging to VFA-37 “Bulls” who were in the air alongside them during the mission. The full video of the presentation can be viewed here . There’s a lot of detail in it and at times it is pretty damn comical as well. I would highly recommend watching it. A Super Hornet is readied for launch aboard the USS George H.W. Bush during operations in the eastern Mediterranean., USN The mission started out as just another close air support sortie over Syria. Freedom 33 and 34 were Tremel and his wingman flying F/A-18Es, Freedom 43 and 44 were another section of F/A-18Cs headed to the same area near Raqqa to provide on-call air support. The mission of the carrier’s air wing at the time was clear—to attack ISIS and to help protect friendly forces on the ground in both Syria and Iraq. During the carrier’s time in the area of operations some big things had happened that underlined an increasingly complex situation in Syria, which could also affect the air war happening over the country. First was the Tomahawk missile attack on Shayrat airfield in early April. The second was the shooting down of an Iranian drone over southern Syria by a USAF F-15E in early June. As such, the rules of engagement were constantly changing and the carrier’s fighter crews were being told that they needed to be ready to defend ground units from a third party aerial attack, along with a slew of other air-to-air contingencies. The crews briefed and launched off the carrier as part of the second wave of aircraft being sent into Syria from the aircraft carrier that day. The USS George H.W. Bush was operating in the eastern Mediterranean south of Crete at the time. There had been lots of air-to-ground weapons “drops” made earlier that day so there was a good likelihood that the four pilots could also see some action. The Bulls’ commander, who was part of the earlier wave of missions into Syria, was on the radio and the pilots could tell from his transmissions that the situation on the ground around ISIS’s de facto capital of al Raqqa was heating up. Armed up “War Party” VFA-87 Golden Warriors Super Hornet blasts off the waist catapult of the USS George H.W. Bush on its way to Syria., USN They took the northern route into Syria which likely took them over Turkey and around Russian air defenses arrayed along Syria’s coastline. The flights checked in with the Joint Terminal Air Controller (JTAC) on the ground south of the city of al Tabqa, an area where Syrian forces were getting dangerously close to friendly forces. The group of four strike fighters entered the close air support stack (CAS stack) overhead the JTAC and waited for any requests for strikes when a Russian Su-27 showed up and began loitering high overhead. Mob, who was having issues with his targeting pod, was assigned to keep tabs on the circling Russian fighter while the other pilots continued with their CAS mission. He turned the Super Hornet’s master mode to air-to-air and began tracking the Su-27 and searching the skies around the area for other aircraft. Then another radar track appeared—a fast moving aircraft coming from the south directly towards him. Although Mob figured it was probably a Syrian aircraft, he moved to intercept the target and eventually made a visual identification on what turned out to be a Syrian Air Force Su-22 Fitter swing-wing attack jet—the same type of aircraft used to deliver the gas attack that led to the Tomahawk missile strike a few months earlier. Syrian Su-22 Fitter., AP Mob made it clear during the presentation that if the Syrian jet just turned away that would have been great as they had plenty to do in support of ground forces, but that didn’t end up being the case. After identifying the Su-22, Mob got on the radio with an airborne command and control post, an E-3 Sentry, and had them broadcast warnings repeatedly over guard frequency to the Syrian jet. Those radio calls did not result in a change of course by the Syrian pilot. Then Mob “thumped” the Su-22 three times—flying close over the jet’s canopy and popping flares out in front of it before breaking off—to warn him away. That didn’t work either. By then the Su-22 was in striking distance of friendly forces and it began to dive, releasing its weapons in the process, before making a climb out after the attack. Based on the rules of engagement that were briefed to the naval aviators, Mob locked the Su-22 up from behind with an AIM-9X Sidewinder and fired. The missile zipped off the Hornet’s wing rail trailing smoke but quickly disappeared. It wasn’t clear why the missile failed to track the Su-22 or where it had gone. Mob quickly selected an AIM-120 AMRAAM and fired once again. He noted how long it took for the missile to fire off the Super Hornet’s “cheek” station located along the outer edges of its air intakes. Regardless, the missile tracked the Fitter flying just a short distance away and exploded on its backside, pitching it violently to the right and downward. The pilot was clearly seen ejecting from the doomed swing-wing attack jet. The ejection seat passed very close down the right sight of Mob’s canopy. He noted how live-fire training helped him during the engagement because he knew what to expect and quickly rolled away from the explosion instead of flying through it. The Syrian pilot’s chute blossomed, it was white, green, and orange in color and his emergency transmitter beacon began going off over the radio. By now Mob and his wingmen found themselves low down and deep inside an enemy air defenses engagement zone. With the entire power structure over Syria potentially shattered, and the Russian Flanker still orbiting overhead, Mob jettisoned his air-to-ground ordnance. With things having become somewhat quiet on the ground and considering one of the friendly jets above just shot down a hostile fighter, the JTAC released the division of jets and they began to cautiously egress out of the area. Luckily a KC-10 Extender tanker was made available to them and everyone had a moment to relax and collect their thoughts during the aerial refueling evolution. The panel of pilots all pretty much noted just how nice it was to have the KC-10’s big soft refueling “basket” to plug into after such a stressful situation—a much more acceptable reality than having to refuel from a KC-135R’s “Iron Maiden” hose and drogue that attached to the tanker’s flying boom. Super Hornets refuel from a KC-10., DoD With just a single AIM-9X left on Mob’s jet, and having just shot down another plane, he and his wingman got cleared to return to the carrier. The other section of jets from VFA-37 was tasked to head to Mosul, Iraq to provide close air support for the then ongoing operation to route ISIS from the sprawling city. The two F/A-18Cs quickly ventured east to Iraq, where they would have to follow a totally different set of rules of engagement. In the end one of the aircraft ended up dropping weapons on ISIS positions in the city before finally return back to the USS George H.W. Bush. After executing a high-speed overhead break and landing aboard the ship, Mob taxied to a parking spot and got out of the jet. The scene was not like the triumphant ending moments of Top Gun, the Lieutenant Commander shook a few hands and was promptly told by the plane captain that he had to move along because the jet needed to rearmed and refueled as it was slated to head back into Syrian in hour. Even down below in the ship’s squadron spaces Mob had to go about his normal business even though he had been the first Naval Aviator to down another jet in many, many years. As the Air Wing’s Safety Duty Officer he had to make his rounds collecting safety reports from various units—not glamorous work after racking up an enemy kill. “The show goes on” as Tremel noted with a smile. There were a few after-action takeaways from the mission as well. First off, the pilots referenced the HUD tape and cockpit recordings from this engagement. We had reached out to multiple commands shortly after the incident to obtain it but we were told it was classified/not releasable. Hopefully that will change because it is probably pretty spectacular considering the close ranges involved with the engagement and the multiple flybys on the doomed Syrian Fitter. Additionally, everyone stressed how interactions with Russian aircrews happened all the time over Syria and were professional in nature. Even the Flanker that had been orbiting high above the Hornets when all this occurred followed them from a distance for a bit as they headed towards the tanker before turning back. It sounds as if the air war over Syria and Iraq has settled into such a long term operation that the presence of an airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft in the region might not always be assured, nor are they really effective at directing counter-air activities for most tactical aircraft as they aren’t there for that mission. Instead they are concentrated on close air support activities. Mob and his flight was first alerted to the presence of the Su-22 via Mob’s own radar, not by an E-2 or E-3 early warning and control aircraft. It’s not clear if this was a technical issue or an operational one, but a mixture of both may be most accurate. Really it seems like the AEW&C assets are based more on administering the air war than on being part of it on a tactical level. For F-22s or other dedicated counter-air assets they are probably heavily involved, but as the set of four Navy fighter pilots mentioned, there were no dedicated counter-air assets around that day. E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS)., USAF One of the pilots also noted how training with captive training rounds, including different bombs and missiles, is important. Pilots and weapons systems officers interface with these weapons differently when they are actually hanging on the jet than when they are represented in the simulator or by the aircraft’s training software. He noted there are more options when it comes to how crews can employ them in real training than in virtual training. The crews also noted that air-to-air missiles have been loaded and unloaded onto and off of Navy fighters for decades without a single operational use. The enlisted guys on the ship bear this burden even when it is extremely unlikely they will be used in actual combat. Yet when these weapons were finally needed, they were there and even with the dud AIM-9X, they ended up getting the job done. So hats off to the enlisted guys and gals that do the heavy lifting on the ship and on shore, without it crews wouldn’t be prepared for these types of contingencies. The incident also highlights the Super Hornets multi-role capability, going from a bomb-laden close air support platform to an air-to-air fighter at the flick of a switch. It also underlines how good the pilots that fly them are. The Bulls F/A-18C pilots who didn’t get the kill but happily went on to drop bombs on ISIS in an entirely different country on the same mission is a testament to their ability to compartmentalize and adapt on the fly. Redshirts load up an AIM-9X onto a Hornet. , USN The crystal clear rules of engagement given to these crews before their mission, and higher-ups’ willingness to stand behind their crews when executing those rules of engagement on the fly was also a huge factor in the success of the engagement. The pilots know their decisions can have wide-ranging strategic impacts, but if they follow their orders precisely, and if they know that their commanders will support their actions made under those orders, the whole system works in a smooth and robust nature even in highly complex scenarios. In some ways fighter pilots flying in a complex air warfare environment, especially one without heavy command and control support, have to be a judge, jury, and executioner of sorts, and their verdicts have to be doled out in a blink of an eye. Thus clear rules of engagement and well trained crews that can interpret and apply those rules appropriately are critical to success. What’s also worth discussing is the conjecture surrounding the AIM-9X’s failure in this engagement. By the panel’s account it sounded as if the AIM-9X just went stupid/malfunctioned on its own. There was no talk of the Su-22 launching flares, and even if it had, the fact that many military pundits are definitively claiming that the unique infrared signature of Russian-built low-end decoy flares threw the AIM-9X off course is just silly. Missiles fail, especially air-to-air ones. They are complex devices that get battered around under high gravitational forces and slammed down onto carrier decks and runways throughout their lifetime. And yes, it’s possible that under certain parameters weaknesses could exist when it comes to the AIM-9X’s ability to track certain targets that use certain decoys under certain conditions. Then again maybe they don’t. Regardless, that doesn’t mean that is what happened in this instance or that the AIM-9X is somehow a lousy missile because of it. The amount of research and development that has gone into the Sidewinder family of air-to-air missiles is unrivaled. And testing goes far beyond live fire shoots or lab-like settings. Entire soundstage like testing facilities are built for refining American air-to-air missile seekers’ abilities to prosecute a successful kill. Additionally, they are tested against all types of decoys, including non-traditional expendables like BOL IR decoys as well as various types of flares. So while anything is possible, there is no evidence that supports this theory that old Russian “dirty flares” defeat the AIM-9X’s highly sensitive imaging infrared seeker and programming logic. Now the real question is what happened to that errant AIM-9X that was fired, or at least what was left of it? Russian would probably love to take a good look at it. Maybe the biggest takeaway of all from this presentation is just how awesome our Naval Aviators are. These guys seem extremely talented and are affable and self deprecating all at the same time. It’s exciting to see that the Navy continues to attract top talent to its tactical air power ranks. And although Lt. Cmdr. Michael “Mob” Tremel pulled the trigger and was attributed the kill, it really was a team effort.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s always cool to see an old aircraft get a second chance at life, but one that gets a third chance, that’s rare. One unique helicopter with a special history was recently awarded just that. NVH-3A bureau number 150614 first entered service 45 years ago, in 1972. During its youth it toted around Presidents Nixon and Ford as “Marine One.” It later served with Helicopter Combat Support Squadron HC-6 where it got flown heavily. In the early 1980s, after putting some 4,500 hours on its meter, the Sea King was sent to storage at Davis Monthan AFB’s sprawling boneyard. In the late 1980s “614” was pulled from storage and regenerated to flying status so that it could act as a test aircraft at the Navy’s premier aircraft test center—NAS Patuxent River in Maryland. It lived its second life as a surrogate test aircraft for the fleet of “White Top” VH-3Ds flown by HMX-1. When the President is onboard these aircraft famously go by the callsign “Marine One.” #614 started out life flying Presidents Ford and Nixon., President Ford Presidential Library The Presidential airlift mission is extremely dynamic, demanding, and critical to national security. In addition to being flown all around the U.S. and the world to support the President’s travels, VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns based at Naval Support Facility Anacostia have to be ready without notice to grab the President from the White House and whisk him off to a safe location , hopefully before an enemy attack can arrive. With these factors in mind, the nearly antique VH-3D fleet needs to be reliable and a special maintenance program has been devised and implemented to see that they are. These helicopters are literally “caged off” from their “green top” counterparts in a high security maintenance hangar at HMX-1’s base in Quantico, Virginia. There they get special care and more frequent inspections than pretty much any other helicopters flying today. On top of that, even though the VH-3Ds are old, they have to be constantly refitted with upgrades to lessen the impact of their increasing age. They also have to be outfitted with the latest survivability capabilities, which include various infrared countermeasures systems. Their communication system also need to stay cutting edge so that the President can stay in contact with the National Command Authority and his cabinet at all times. The VH-3D will soldier on into the next decade when it along with the VH-60N are slated to be replaced by the VH-92. , AP All this systems integration work and development of updated operating procedures requires testing, and that’s exactly what NVH-3A “614” did for Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 21 (HX-21) up until 2013. That year, 614 was assigned to be the test platform for the VH-3D Cockpit Upgrade Program (CUP), which would finally see the VIP Sea Kings receive a modern glass cockpit. In preparation for this work, the helicopter was totally stripped of its avionics, including its wiring harness. Then the program was abruptly cancelled. By 2014, with 614 now a useless gutted hulk, HX-21’s creative maintainers began putting a plan together to return the four decades old helicopter back to service as the VH-3D fleet would be soldiering on for years to come. This was not a task that maintainers usually do. This type of work usually happens at dedicated depot facilities that concentrate on totally overhauling airframes, not by people who focus on keeping them flying from day to day. Although some of the parts needed for the resurrection could be ordered from Sikorsky, with the Sea King being out of production for so long, many elements required for the restoration simply didn’t exist, so the HX-21 team built them from scratch. Over 200 parts were custom machined so that 614 would have a chance at flying again, and each one had to go through a stringent engineering approval process. While the team from HX-21 was basically rewiring the entire airframe, they also updated many of the helicopter’s other major components. This would allow 614 to better represent the VH-3Ds flying operationally with HMX-1 than it ever did in the past. Along with updated avionics, which were still made up largely of “steam gauges,” the helicopter’s rotors, drivetrain, turbine engines, landing gear, and fuel system were all replaced with the latest standard equipment. One element that didn’t get touched was the helicopter’s ’70s era VIP interior —a far cry from the internal cabin configuration of VH-3Ds that fly the President around today. Dwight “Chic” James, the Presidential Helicopter fleet’s quality assurance officer (no stress in that job right?) stated the following to Naval Aviation News : “We had to create a manufacturing quality assurance process, which is different than what we normally do in a maintenance environment… I don’t know if anybody on that crew has done this volume of work on a particular aircraft. Before, the aircraft had some VH-3D-like systems in racks. The avionics were in racks in the cabin and that’s how they had to use them… The right-hand side of the cockpit was the only VH-3D portion, and now the entire ship is essentially a VH-3D aircraft.” On April 4th, 2017 614 took to the air in a hover once again, which evoked huge pride from everyone involved in the unique and highly challenging initiative. The helicopter is now actively involved with multiple upgrade programs for the VH-3D fleet, including lighting upgrades, flight program changes, and enhancements to the system that performs rotor track and balance for the high-profile helicopters. #614 sits fully restored in HX-21’s hangar at NAS Pax River., USN With 614 flying again, HX-21 won’t have to borrow a fleet VH-3D for testing. This is a very good thing because the White Top VH-3D cadre is in extreme demand even as they enter the twilight of their service lives. As of now, the first VH-92 replacement aircraft for the current White Top Presidential Airlift fleet won’t enter operational service until after the turn of the decade. The earliest possible declaration of initial operating capability is expected to be sometime in 2020, at which time the drawdown of the VH-3D fleet will finally begin. So even if things go perfectly, 614 has years of work left supporting the VH-3D fleet. Regardless of when the VH-3D fleet meets its final demise, being left for nearly dead twice in its career, the 45 year old #614 is now more capable and up to date than it has ever been. That’s a testament not only to Sikorsky’s iconic Sea King design, but also to the talented problem solvers over at HX-21.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 8, 2019",Report Claims Famed Russian Test Pilot Warned USAF Pilot Before Fatal Crash Near Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rumors continue to swirl around the mysterious death of Lt. Col. Eric “Doc” Schultz near Area 51 on September 5th. Various theories exist, including one that says he was the commander of the elite and shadowy “Red Hats” squadron that secretly flies foreign tactical aircraft for test and training purposes. Make sure to read all about these theories here . Now a report has emerged from the Russian website Radio Moscow claiming that a famous Russian test pilot was not only in contact with Schultz shortly before the crash, but that he warned him of executing certain maneuvers while flying Russian hardware. Magomed Tolboyev is one of Russia’s most prominent aviation figures. He served as a decorated test pilot during the Cold War, testing many types of high performance and exotic aircraft, including the Soviet space shuttle Buran . He has since been given the title Hero of Russia and has worked with many Russian civil and military aviation firms since the fall of the Soviet Union. Most recently Tolboyev was named the honorary president of the biannual MAKS airshow—Russia’s largest aviation and arms expo. Suffice it to say, if it flies in Russia, Tolboyev knows something about. Russian air force Col. Magomed Tolboyev looks out from the cockpit of the U.S. B-52 Stratofortress bomber during 6th Moscow Space and Aviation Show. In Russia in 2003., USAF The report says the Schultz and Tolboyev were in contact as recently as a month before Schultz’s death. Tolboyev is quoted as stating (Google translation): “I talked with him, I told him a month ago: do not do what we do. I showed him dead loops, but said: do not do this. It’s only our plane, dear, we know what to do with it. First you need to know what you’re on. The Cossack is only a Cossack on his horse. I just warned them: you can not do this. The difference is 1 degree, exactly one degree. He was a good guy, he flew well, his fate is as follows. He was experienced, no questions asked. We must pay tribute: American pilots and English – great pilots, we appreciate them and never badly do not speak of them as professionals. But there are some subtleties very deep, only we, the test pilots know them. I told him: “you’ll perish, you can not do what I do.” This is the line.” Exactly how the supposed contact between the two test pilots was administered remains unclear and there are no indications if it was official or unofficial in nature, if it really even occurred at all. We also don’t know exactly what maneuvers Tolboyev is referencing or what aircraft, but Russia’s latest Flanker variants, such as the Su-30 and Su-35, are the most maneuverable operational fighters in the world. They are capable of incredible acrobatics when flown by specially trained pilots. The Pentagon has a number of Su-27s in its clandestine inventory, but there is no proof that more advanced Flanker derivatives, such as those that feature thrust vectoring, like the Su-30 and Su-35, have been acquired. Nor are there any clear indications that existing Su-27s in the USAF’s secret stable of foreign fighters have been modified to perform in a similar fashion to those more advanced Flanker derivatives. But that doesn’t mean either scenario is impossible. Still, the tactical advantages that could be gleaned from clandestinely procuring an advanced Flanker, or modifying an existing Su-27 to perform like one, seem somewhat limited when compared to the effort, risk, and cost likely required to execute such a program. On the other hand, if this report proves to be even partially valid it will be yet another indication that Schultz was indeed involved in Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) programs and the Area 51 based Red Hats squadron.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 1, 2021","No, That YF-23 Like Rendering Of The Skunk Works’ Next Gen Fighter Isn’t New","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There’s lots of hype going around regarding Lockheed Skunk Works’ most recent promotional video that seems to have been released to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the United States Air Force. The commotion surrounds what some say appears to be a 6th generation fighter concept—one that looks a hell of a lot like Northrop’s passed over YF-23 Black Widow Advanced Tactical Fighter. The thing is that this isn’t a new concept at all, it first appeared in video nearly four years ago in another Skunk Works sizzle reel and I did a little post on it then noting its likeness to the YF-23. The message couldn’t have been stranger: “the future of air dominance is a refreshed 25 year old competitor’s design!” Here are stills from the original video that was posted years ago. , Screecan via Youtube The concept has also appeared in official Lockheed Martin releases in recent years. , Lockheed Martin The video released just days ago called “Skunk Works—On the Path to 75 Years of Innovation” features the design once again: Let me just make this crystal clear—there shouldn’t be another manned fighter, it is a waste of resources and will likely put our country at a serious disadvantage, not the other way around. For those who scoff at that statement, please read this in full , it may change your viewpoint on the issue. With that said, if there is going to be a 6th generation fighter, and assuming the money will materialize for such a program even though the F-35 isn’t even fully operational yet, it will feature elements that I have been begging for for years—ones that are not really fighter-like at all. These include longer range, greater payload, broadband low observability, enhanced sensors carrying and networking capabilities with a focus on battle management and unmanned aircraft control, and possibly higher sustained cruise speed. In other words, something more akin to the tailless and enlarged FB-22 concept that should have been built years ago than anything else. The ability to support directed energy weapons will also be a factor, at least for defensive purposes . Maneuverability and the traditional tactical fighter concept as we know it today—one defined by short combat radiuses, dogfighting, and the addiction to tanker gas—would be no more. Northrop Grumman’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) concept seems to largely embrace this new, more rational albeit less sexy requirement set for a manned tactical jet. And to a large degree, the YF-23 had more in common with these requirements than its competitor, the YF-22. But the F-22 won the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition and it did so for a number of supposed reasons, although officially the fine details as to why remain classified. Northrop Grumman NGAD concept., Northrop Grumman Generally these reasons are known to include in part the maturity of the F-22 prototypes and their impressive overall level of systems integration—supposedly an indicator of lowered developmental risk. It also seems that the super maneuverable YF-22 strayed far closer to home when it came to the established jet fighter concept of the day—one in which maneuverability was highly prized—than the faster and stealthier but less maneuverable Black Widow. Remember, both teams were “selling” their aircraft to a USAF brass made up largely of fighter pilots, so it’s not surprising that the competitor that closest mirrored the F-15 at the time would win the day. Fast forward to today and Northrop Grumman seems to have realized that even the YF-23’s level of maneuverability isn’t really needed for yet another manned fighter. Boeing seems to understand this as well. But what’s right and what’s sellable may be two different things. YF-23 Black Widow., USAF Lockheed’s YF-23 like future fighter design could be put forward along with a far more exotic deviation from the traditional fighter platform—one similar to Northrop Grumman’s NGAD concept—for the USAF to mull over. Doing so would be a hedge against alienating the USAF’s fighter pilot dominated command culture by offering them something that is still somewhat a fighter, along with another concept that is more of an attack interceptor of sorts. Such a strategy would be relevant based on lessons learned during the aforementioned ATF program when the more fighter-like design won the prize. If anything else, floating both concepts allows for Lockheed to get feedback as to which one seems more realistically sellable, regardless of the actual relevancy of its features over the battlefields of tomorrow. In fact, this new video does just that, giving us a very quick glimpse of another Lockheed design that appears to compete more directly with the NGAD concept from Northrop Grumman. You have to look carefully, but this image also pops up briefly in the new Skunk Works video. It looks like a very similar concept to Northrop Grumman’s NGAD design., Youtube Screencap Then again this YF-23 like aircraft design could just be a visual placeholder for Lockheed’s 6th generation fighter concept. But that seems less likely now seeing as the design is still being used even on the company’s official site half a decade after it first emerged, and in a time when 6th generation fighter programs are materializing—for better or worse.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 24, 2017",F-35s Were Carrying Live AIM-120 Missiles During Show Of Force Training Flight Over Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Another day another high-profile photo-op “deterrence” flight over the Korean Peninsula, and it was an impressive one at that . Two B-1Bs, four F-15Ks, four F-2s, and four F-35Bs took part in the mission. We have talked in great detail how these flights have become useless bordering on counter productive , but one peculiar detail of this particular mission may be a signal from the Pentagon to Pyongyang that these elaborate missions are no longer just about showing off force, they are now also about being able to use that force suddenly. While the quartet of F-35Bs from VMFA-121 taxied out for departure from MCAS Iwakuni , their weapons bay doors were left open—at least until it was time to take the active runway for takeoff. Multiple images were posted of this evolution by the Pentagon and you can clearly see AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles hanging onto their hard points on the inner sections of the F-35B’s weapons bay doors. One image in particular (seen above) caught our eye as it offers up an interesting tidbit of information about these missiles—they aren’t captive training rounds, they are live. USAF You can tell a live munition from an inert one by the bands painted on the munition’s body. Blue bands mean the weapon isn’t live while orange and yellow bands mean that it’s a real live round. This is an interesting development because these F-35Bs are on a thoroughly planned training mission, not one that involves actual combat. And although they will be dropping live 1,000lb GBU-32 Joint Direct Attack Munitions—each can carry two internally, the largest weapon that will fit in the B model’s truncated weapons bay—there should be no need to carry live air-to-air missiles as well. USAF What appears to be happening here is that the Pentagon is trying to deliberately signal to North Korea that these training flights can go “operational” at any moment if commanded to do so. Also note that none of the other fighters, including the RoKAF F-15Ks, are armed with live air-to-air missiles, or any air-to-air missiles at all for that matter. The F-35 is especially sensitive to thermal stress, so maybe taxiing with the bay doors open is some sort of mitigation procedure when operating in warm climates—albeit doing so with a 3,000lbs of live weapons stuffed in its low-slung bays seems a bit odd. But still, it seems like extra effort was put into publishing photos showing the missiles on the aircraft prior to their departure from MCAS Iwakuni. Regardless, the fact remains—the F-35s were armed with live air-to-air missiles along with the live GPS guided bombs. But the roughly $20,000 bombs were meant to be dropped in training, the missiles weren’t. USAF Additionally, it’s not common for tactical aircraft to fly live-fire air-to-ground or air-to-air training missions with all live weapons. Usually just one category or the other—the one that is meant to be expended—is live. Not in this case. Making things even stranger is the fact that the F-35Bs were all wearing their r adar reflective Luneburg Lenses which totally zap the stealth jet’s radar evading qualities. These cannot be jettisoned in flight, so if the F-35s were really called upon to punch into North Korean airspace on the fly they would be doing so without their most lauded advantage. USAF Call it a micro-escalation of sorts, but it seems pretty clear that Washington wants Pyongyang to know that these flights are turning into something more than just elaborate and expensive reminders of what aircraft the U.S. and its regional allies have in their inventories. With extremely limited non-kinetic military options left , the relatively subtle escalation does make sense. Here is the full series of images that were released. There are some spectacular shots in there to say the least. Update : So it turns out the F-35B has restrictions on how long its bays can remain closed with weapons in them while on the ground in warm weather. As noted in the piece, I had a feeling this could be the case. The issue was mentioned in the 2015 DOT&E annual report on the F-35 program. It appears that the problem still exists. It remains unclear how this impacted the publishing of the photos specifically showing the live AIM-120s loaded, but once again, the main takeaway is that they are there in the first place. 2015 DOT&E Report Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2018",President Trump’s Idea Of A Huge Military Parade Through The Capital Isn’t Unprecedented,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is putting time in at the United Nation’s headquarters in New York this week and on his schedule yesterday was a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. During the get together Trump brought up how much he loved the Bastille Day military parade he attended as Macron’s guest last July and that he thinks the United States needs to execute something similar next year on the 4th of July. It’s not the first time Trump has pushed for having heavy armor roll down Pennsylvania Avenue, and although the idea draws a lot of ire, it’s certainly not unprecedented. Trump stated the following about the parade he witnessed in Paris and about his own interest in making something similar happen in Washington DC: “It was one of the greatest parades I have ever seen… It was two hours on the button, and was military might, and I think a tremendous thing for France and the spirit of France… And to a large extent, because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on July 4th in Washington, down Pennsylvania Avenue… We’re going to have to try and top it… So we’re actually thinking about 4th of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength.” The 45th President’s longing for a military review of some kind in the Capital is nothing new. Trump’s team wanted to display modern weaponry during his inauguration, which raised many eyebrows to the say the least. In the end the Department of Defense was reluctant to play ball with that request. But even before that Trump discussed his affinity towards showcasing America’s military might, stating last Winter : “…We’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military… That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington DC for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military.” According to his comments at the U.N., Trump, a great lover of parades, is once again trying to get a military parade on the docket for Washington. Such an event is unprecedented in recent years, with flyovers and official honor guards and other more symbolic, non-combat oriented military displays representing the various branches of the Defense Department during official events. But under President George H.W. Bush, following Operation Desert Storm , a victory celebration was put on with all types of hardware used in the war descended on the Capital. I was some sight to behold with even an AV-8B Harrier landing on the Capitol Mall. https://youtube.com/watch?v=EE-KEBEaA6M Aside from victory parades, previous Presidential inaugurations did feature an array of military hardware, although we have to go much further back in time than 1991 to find such an example. Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Kennedy all had large and modern military contingents in their inauguration day parades, with Kennedy being the last to have done so. John F. Kennedy’s inaugural parade. , AP President Kennedy watches as tanks roll by on his inauguration day., AP Even with these historical precedents, today large military parades in a country’s seat of political power seem to conjure up feelings of tyranny and prompt comparisons to dictatorships from some Americans. In addition, some have questioned the Trump Administration’s affinity toward putting military brass, retired or otherwise, in key positions that are usually reserved for civilians that have served primarily in the private or public sectors. Some have regarded this as the “militarization” of the executive branch . President Trump speaks at Andrews AFB for the USAF 70th Anniversary while surrounded by America’s stable of stealth aircraft. , AP There is no doubt that Donald Trump has a huge affection for the United States military and that he finds the talents of those who served in uniform at the highest levels to be useful to his administration. And some clearly disagree with his heavier handed policies when it comes to immigration, borders, and domestic law enforcement, not to mention a more militaristic and aggressive foreign policy abroad. With this in mind, adding a military review on the streets of Washington DC on the Fourth of July will likely only agitate the President’s detractors and result in more accusations that he wants to be a dictator more than an elected official. And some will also point out that we already have air shows, fleet weeks, base open houses, local parades, and Hollywood to some degree to show off America’s military to the civilian population that pays for it. Additionally, many will say the Fourth of July should be about celebrating the American values of freedom and liberty, not weaponry. A Harrier lands on the Capitol Mall in 1991., AP On the other hand the simple truth is that weaponry, warfare, and those who were willing to fight for the freedom were the things that made the dream of America a reality. With that in mind, celebrating that legacy directly by displaying the weapons and warriors American has today may seem like a logical and exciting idea for some. Yet when it comes to modern military parades, the dictatorships and quasi tyrannical governments of the world still seem to have everyone beat , and over 25 years since the end of the Cold War it seems like the practice is going through a grand renaissance of sorts. But is this something that America really needs to be a part of? Regardless of the logic behind it, we’ll have to wait till July Fourth, 2018 to see if the Donald Trump finally gets the “yuuuge” military parade he has always dreamed of.

The ship is the manifestation of the Soviet Union’s top naval weapons technology during the waning years of the Cold War. You can read all about it in this past profile I did on the class . Although she has received some light upgrades in recent years, Pyotr Veliky will be leaving the fleet in the next couple of years to undergo a deep refit. Her long mothballed sister ship, the Admiral Nakhimov , is finishing a similar deep refit and will be taking the Pyotr Veliky’s place as the flagship of the Northern Fleet . This means that Pyotr Veliky still has much of its original armament, including the 20 massive P-700 ‘Granit/SS-N-19 ‘Shipwreck’ anti-ship cruise missiles stored in canted launch tubes in her bow. And its one of these hulking “carrier killers” that Pyotr Veliky test fired this week. Thankfully, the Russian Ministry of Defense released video of the launch, which is a pretty rare sight to say the least: I described the SS-N-19 in a previous profile I wrote on the Kuznetsov class aircraft carrier , which also carried a dozen of these missiles: “These missiles were designed in the late 1970s and intended to allow Russia’s future capital ships to be able to reliably strike American carrier battle groups from outside the range of their surface-based weapon systems. In combat, the missiles would be launched in large salvos, they would then scream toward their targets as fast as mach 2.5 at altitude or at about mach 1.5 while low over the water. The missiles were very advanced for their time, integrating networking and automated cooperative “swarm” tactics. They were launched at a target (or targets) usually based on third party data, such as coordinates derived by a scout ship, a maritime patrol aircraft, or even a submarine. They would fly toward their targets from over 350 miles away on inertial navigation, then as they approached the suspected target area, one missile out of the swarm would “pop up” to higher altitude to use its own active radar and anti-radiation sensors to obtain updated targeting info. It would then classify these targets and assign them to missiles in the swarm below. If the pop-up missile was destroyed another one would automatically take its place. The missiles could also accept midcourse updates from third party sources as well and supposedly had connectivity to the now defunct Soviet-era EORSAT satellite network . Once in the terminal attack phase of their flight, each surviving missile would acquire its own target and prosecute that target, blazing over the horizon at supersonic speeds and giving (presumably) American close-in weapon systems little time to react. There is no doubt, the P-700 was born to be a high-end carrier killer. Their speed and numbers would overwhelm a Carrier Battle Group’s defenses, and their individual warheads were large enough to register a kill even on America’s largest surface combatants. The Soviet Navy’s aspirations were clear, with twenty of these monsters available on Kirov class battlecruisers, two dozen on Oscar class nuclear guided missile submarines, and a dozen on the carriers that would eventually be known as the Kuznetsov class, Soviet surface action groups could have filled the air with these deadly missiles.” The SS-N-19 with its booster attached is about the size and weight of a combat loaded MiG-21 and packs a 1,650 high explosive charge or a 500kt thermonuclear warhead. In the case of the latter, a near miss is still a certain kill, although it’s very unlikely that the Russians still deploy these missiles loaded with nuclear warheads. Russian crew handles a massive P700/SS-N-19., Public Domain So yeah, this was the missile behind Soviet Russia’s “carrier killer” strategy of the last decade of the Cold War. But technology has changed a remakrably since the 1980s and the upgraded Kirov class ships will do away with the SS-N-19 system altogether. In a previous piece on the upgrades that will be done to these vessels, the description of what will take the SS-N-19’s place is impressive: “These refitted Kirov class battlecruisers will supposedly feature a whole new set of sensors and subsystems, and most ominously, weapons. Russia’s TASS news agency reports that the ships will receive totally updated multipurpose vertical launch systems, making these ships capable of carrying a much wider variety of anti-ship missiles and many more of them. Navyrecognition.com sums up this upgrade well, and their analysis is consistent with other sources on the matter: The Sevmash Shipyard and the Special Machinebuilding Design Bureau (KBSM, a subsidiary of Almaz-Antei) made a deal for 10 3S-14-11442M vertical launch systems (VLS) to equip the Project 11442M Admiral Nakhimov missile cruiser being upgraded now. The contract is valued at 2.559 billion rubles ($33.5 million). Thus, the ship’s 20 inclined below-deck launchers of P-700 Granit antiship missiles (SS-N-19 Shipwreck) will be replaced with 10 VLS modules of the UKSK versatile ship-based launch system. The VLS modules will total 80. The same solution is expected to be applied to the Pyotr Veliky cruiser. The 3S-14 VLS can launch the missiles of the Kalibr family (SS-N-27 Sizzler). In addition, the equipment for testing the VLS using mockups of the 3M-54, 3M55 and 3M22 antiship missiles is to be ready be December 2016…” TASS reports that the upgraded Kirovs will house a mix of hypersonic Zircon, supersonic Onix and long-range subsonic Kalibr cruise missiles , and that with an arsenal of 80 anti-ship missiles stuffed in their vertical launch tubes, these ships will have have “enough to engage any existing naval force globally.” And this doesn’t include the updates to other armaments, including its air defense systems. In total the refitted Kirov class cruisers will have somewhere around 174 vertical launch cells and will sport a seagoing version of the S-400 air defense system . With all this in mind, and with the Pyotr Veliky heading into refit it the not so distant future, this may be the last time we get to see one of the big “Shipwreck” carrier killers being slung off a Kirov class battlecruiser’s bow.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 13, 2017",Navy Secretary Says Perry Class Frigates Could Be Brought Back On The Cheap Without Upgrades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On its mission to field a 355 ship fleet, the US Navy has been looking at what it has in storage to help make that goal a reality. Even the carrier USS Kitty Hawk has been put forward as a possible candidate for regeneration, although the reality of what it would take to truly make such an endeavor successful puts it firmly in the unlikely category. But the seven Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates now sitting in mothballs tell another story. Now Secretary of Navy Richard Spencer is saying these ships could be regenerated very cheaply and without any major upgrades at all, but their mission set would be very limited. Many of the Navy’s retired Perry class frigates were sold to friendly countries all over the globe. Many of those navies have drastically upgraded the stoutly built ships with modern systems, including vertical launch cells and RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM). If the Navy were to go down a similar path with the seven Perry class frigates it still has its hands on, these ships could serve in higher threat environments than their Littoral Combat Ship replacements . In addition, foreign operators of the Perry class plan on sailing the ships for decades to comes, so there really isn’t any reason why the US Navy couldn’t do the same. But under the plan that SECNAV Spencer is talking about, these ships wouldn’t get any combat system upgrades at all. Instead they would be seaworthy and navigation ready only. USNI News reports Spencer mentioned that other navies have gotten retired Perry class frigates back out to sea for as little as $35,000, which is about one sixth the price of a full tank of gas for the type. Independence class LCS and the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate., USN With no combat system upgrades, a reintroduced Perry class would primarily be tasked with supporting the highly controversial war on drugs—sailing in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to interdict contraband shipments. Basically they would work as counter-narcotics platforms for operations in very low threat environments. In doing so, the plan would relieve higher-end assets of the mission, including Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Littoral Combat Ships. Spencer stated the following regarding bringing back what’s left of the Perry class: “Is a DDG the thing to put for drug interdictions down in the Caribbean? I don’t think so… Do we actually have something in the portfolio right now? One of the things we might look at is bringing the Perry-class to do a limited drug interdiction mode… No combat systems, but sea-ready, navigation ready, radar ready out the door… That’s a pretty inexpensive proven platform right there…Can you arm it up with Tomahawks? No.” Foreign allies have received dozens of second-hand Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, many of which have been upgraded with modern systems, including vertical launch cells and larger hangar decks. Here is Turkey’s G class alongside an USN Arleigh Burke class destroyer., USN I know what you’re asking yourself—why not just fund the Coast Guard to operate these ships and get the Navy out of the drug interdiction game altogether? Good question, one that I am not fully prepared to answer definitively on, but it likely has to do with petty budget squabbling, the fact that the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, and fear of mission and budget loss on behalf of the Navy. And remember, it’s all about claiming a 355 ship fleet, and Coast Guard vessels don’t factor into that goal. Let’s be clear, the DoD gives a lot to the war on drugs—including many absurdly mismatched capabilities like hunting for drug boats with heavy bombers . So the fact that US Navy surface combatants continue to support these operations isn’t surprising. But in an era of overworked crews and hardware, and a growing number of priorities to satisfy with limited budgets, maybe rethinking how the DoD contributes to this mission is necessary before committing what will be largely single role assets to it. By reviewing the roles of the other federal agencies that primarily deal with drug interdiction on a daily basis, along with coming up with a list of what gear they would need to execute the mission without the DoD’s help, we could get a better idea of if getting the Navy—and possibly the other services as well—out of this mission makes sense or not. We would also get a better idea of what the mission truly costs to sustain. Sailors aboard the guided missile frigate USS John L. Hall (FFG 32) off-load 15,000 pounds of illegal drugs that were seized in two separate interagency busts, which included two Jacksonville-based units. , USN With tightening land borders, the sea will only become a more prevalent drug smuggling medium, so more advanced maritime assets will be needed in the future to accomplish the mission proficiently, not the other way around. Maybe a smaller commercial grade vessel with more advanced sensors could be built and operated over time for far less than the aging Perry class. Going that route could also offer more capability to confront future smuggling threats. So what I am saying here is there are alternatives to using a destroyer or LCS to hunt for drug smugglers, and even the Perry class may be better used as an upgraded surface combatant capable of operating in medium to higher threat scenarios or even for lower intensity operations in troubled regions than as a stripped-down drug interdiction platform. On the other hand, maybe they are suited for this mission, but in the hands of the Coast Guard not the Navy. And if the Coast Guard is given a bump in budget to field these seven frigates instead of the Navy, the Navy would then lower their 355 ship goal to 348 ships right? Don’t count on it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The men and women of Strike Fightrer Squadron 31, better known as the Tomcatters, returned from a highly eventful cruise to Middle East where they pummeled ISIS in both Iraq and Syria with their F/A-18E Super Hornets. During their time deployed as part of Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8) aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, a pilot belonging to another F/A-18E squadron, Lt. Cmdr. Michael “Mob” Tremel or VFA-87 “Golden Warriors,” shot down a Syrian Su-22 Fitter. A highly detailed account of that incident has been made by those who were there, but now we finally get to see video of the shoot down thanks to the Tomcatters. The clips of the shoot down start at 6:10 and appear to show multiple angles of the engagement through ATFLIR targeting pods that the Hornets carry on their intake chin station. You can see the Su-22 flying along, then get pummeled by an AIM-120 from two angles (or is the first of the two clips showing the errant Sidewinder that was fired first?), then we see the Su-22 spinning into the ground and exploding in a big fireball. Heady stuff to say the least! https://youtube.com/watch?v=LWtRjcLRQFk Beyond the shoot-down footage, the video is filled with a mix of pinpoint bombing, including the merciless bombardment of a large structure (4:30), strafing runs, dogfighting, tanking, and gorgeous moments depicting cruise life from the cockpit’s perspective. We also get so see some Russian Flanker action, including various intercepts of fully armed Su-27 derivatives, as well what looks like one of these jets dropping flares between a Tomcatter and their target (13:25). Maybe one of the best parts is seeing a Super all armed up for counter-air, sporting six AIM-120s, a pair of AIM-9Xs, an ATFLIR pod, and a centerline fuel tank. Youtube Screengrab Another really cool clip is of a gun engagement of some type, where you can clearly see the HUD symbology in color with the gun firing out of the Hornet’s nose, and then the rounds arrive just at the spot where the gun pipper is on, causing an explosion. I’m not sure exactly what we are seeing here target wise, but the footage is damn cool to watch (4:45). This is clearly one of the best cruise videos we have ever seen, and who would expect less from the famous “Fighting 31?” The video also touts the squadron’s basic accomplishments during their time overseas, which include dropping 451 munitions on a very deserving enemy, weighing just over 450,000lbs in total. Thats a lot of boom. Well done ‘Felix,’ well done.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 17, 2019",Last Time North Korea Shot Down A U.S. Military Plane It Could Have Led To Nuclear War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of the firestorm of rhetoric and provocative tit-for-tat military displays of force between the North Korea and the United States and its allies, which has included near constant flights of B-1 bombers and fighter escorts near North Korean borders, Pyongyang highest ranking diplomat now says the reclusive country has the right to shoot those bombers down—even when they are operating in international airspace. DPRK foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said the following to reporters while in New York for the U.N. General Assembly: “Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country… In light of the declaration of war by Trump, all options will be on the operations table of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.” Ri was referring to not only Donald Trump’s speech to the U.N. last Tuesday, but also to a tweet that the President sent out on Saturday: Earlier on Saturday it was announced that B-1 bombers and their F-15C escorts had ventured north of the Demarkation Line that separates North Korea and South Korea for the first time in the “21st Century.” They did so in international airspace near North Korea’s eastern coastline. Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the following about the mission: “This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat… North Korea’s weapons program is a grave threat to the Asia-Pacific region and the entire international community. We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the U.S. homeland and our allies.” B-1B refuels during the unprecedented nighttime deterrence mission north of the 38th parallel. The bombers were escorted by F-15C fighters out of Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. , USAF North Korea’s air defenses North Korea’s air defenses aren’t by any means state of the art but they also aren’t as completely antiquated as some may think. If anything, they are dense and still pose a serious threat to U.S. and ROK air power. During a conflict, electronic warfare—specifically jamming—and a protracted suppression/destruction of enemy air defense (SEAD/DEAD) campaign will open up corridors into the country that non low-observable (stealthy) aircraft can operate in and out of. The first deep strikes of such a campaign would be executed by B-2 Spirit bombers and cruise missiles, as well as F-22s and F-35s if they are in the region, and they will be primarily aimed at neutering the Kim Regime’s nuclear weapons and missile arsenals, command and control capabilities, as well as critical air defense nodes. With this in mind, the idea that a couple of these B-1s and a handful of F-15C escorts would penetrate deep into North Korean airspace to strike targets directly just isn’t that plausible. Even the F-35Bs stationed in Japan, which have recently flown an armed mission with the B-1Bs, may be able to penetrate deep into North Korean airspace, but they can only carry 1,000lb class weapons which are not capable of taking out hardened or large targets. Still, the B-1Bs pose a significant threat to unhardened and semi-hardened targets in North Korea anytime they are within a few hundred miles of the country as they would be used as cruise missile launch platforms during the opening stages of a war. Additionally, just because these bombers and their escorts are flying outside North Korean airspace doesn’t mean they are safe from potential attack. North Korea has fielded a copy of China’s HQ-9 surface-to-air missile system—itself a copy of the Russian S-300 system—called the Pongae-5 and designated the KN-06 . This indigenous SAM system gives North Korea a huge leap in anti-air capability over its Soviet era SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5 missiles. But even these older systems can be dangerous in a skilled operator’s hands. The KN-06 can reach out many dozens of miles from North Korea’s borders. If the big bomber and their fighter escorts venture too close to North Korean shores, even while still well into international airspace, they could be confronted with this threat. When it comes to North Korea’s largely antique air force, B-1 bombers—or any other aircraft for that matter—escorted by American fighters wouldn’t be the easiest of targets—quite the opposite in fact. North Korean jets, even their handful of dated MiG-29s, would have next to no chance of taking down an asset under fighter protection. But an armada of surveillance aircraft keeps tabs on North Korea on a daily basis. By and large these are unarmed, unprotected, lumbering flying machines. You can read all about them in this prior feature . So although the B-1s may be the most symbolic of targets, and they do pose a direct threat to North Korea, if Kim ordered the shoot down of an American aircraft, especially via air-to-air combat, there are plenty other targets—ones far more vulnerable—to choose from. https://youtube.com/watch?v=BSP2FYTPiMU But the farcical possibility of North Korea launching an intercept on an asset protected by fighters aside, the thing is that even the B-1Bs’ escorts could do little in response to a missile launch if North Korea was able to fire one within range of the bombers. The aircraft have defensive countermeasures, the B-1B’s suite is quite elaborate when it works, but none of the aircraft seen on these show of force training missions could respond by firing a missile at the threatening SAM site itself. That may change following the foreign minister statement. Don’t be surprised if you see fully armed F-16CJs acting as counter-air and “wild weasel” escorts for the big bombers during their next mission. The technological capabilities of North Korea’s anti-air arsenal aside, maybe the most worrisome aspect of North Korea’s threat against the bombers is that there is a precedent for such an engagement occurring—one that could have resulted in the nuclear bombardment of North Korea. The doomed flight of DEEP SEA 129 Nearly 50 years ago, on April 15th, 1969, a U.S. Navy EC-121M Warning Star intelligence gathering aircraft—which was based on the legendary Lockheed Super Constellation—from Fleet Reconnaissance Squadron One (VQ-1), made its way from its NAS Atsugi in Japan to international airspace off North Korea’s eastern shore. Its mission was considered low-risk in nature and included the gathering a whole range of signals and communications intelligence emanating from the reclusive country. The mission’s call sign was DEEP SEA 129. The type of reconnaissance flight that DEEP SEA 129 was on that day was nothing really unique as under the program known as Peacetime Aerial Reconnaissance Program (PARP), code named Beggar Shadow, regular surveillance flights of North Korea common during the late 1960s. The Signals Intelligence gathering Warning Star and its 31 crew, of which nine were linguists and cryptologists, would head into the Sea of Japan and set up an orbit near North Korea’s border with Russia. The crew could come no closer than 50 miles from North Korean shores during the mission. After its intelligence gathering duties were finished with, the modified “Super Connie” would recover at Osan Air Base in South Korea. On this mission, that recovery never happened. USN Just after 12:30pm local time, nearly two hours after the DEEP SEA 129 had been on station, two MiG-21s launched from an airfield near Wonson, North Korea. 30 minutes later DEEP SEA 129 made a scheduled report but didn’t note anything out of the ordinary. US Army radar operators in South Korea had briefly lost track of the two MiG-21s around 1:22pm, but then reacquired them around 1:37pm—they were headed on a bee-line intercept course for DEEP SEA 129. By 1:44pm DEEP SEA 129’s squadron, who monitored intelligence being actively passed across the national security network, had issued a “condition three” radio call to DEEP SEA 129’s crew, which told them they were possibly under attack. The crew immediately aborted the mission, turning the big piston powered aircraft towards South Korea. Then the MiGs pounced. At 1:47pm the two fighters merged with the EC-121 and two minutes later the lumbering intelligence gathering aircraft dropped off radar. DEEP SEA 129 was defenseless as most intelligence gathering missions are by design, and continue to be so till this very day. Everyone onboard the aircraft was killed in the engagement. The response At first it was thought that the crew may have survived and just dove the aircraft below radar coverage as a defensive maneuver. The pilots never radioed that they were under attack so interceptors were launched to give the aircraft cover as it returned to South Korea and also to create a higher alert posture near the DMZ. The EC-121 never popped back up on radar again. By around 2:45pm the incident was deemed a hostile shoot-down prompting emergency messages being wired to the National Command Authority. Search and rescue assets, with fighter cover, were deployed to search for DEEP SEA 129’s crew shortly after. Within a handful of hours, North Korea quickly spun the shoot-down as a great accomplishment and claimed that the Warning Star had violated its airspace. But it remained unclear why the shoot-down was ordered. Nobody could really explain it from an external perspective, but there was no doubt that it was a massive escalation and an act of war. In Washington, the Nixon Administration was struggling with how to respond. A total breakdown in command and control occurred following the incident. Information was scarce and even the location and status of American forces in the region were unclear. The process of simply reacting to the event based on quality information went on so long that a quick retaliation was not possible. Nobody could tell if this was an isolated incident or one that came at the direction of the top echelons of North Korea’s military power-structure and just a sign of things to come. While the White House was in disarray, fighters deployed to South Korea were loaded with tactical nuclear weapons and put on the highest alert , thankfully they were told to stand down hours later. At first, the sentiment of some U.S. military commanders was to “clobber them” as a declassified after-action report describes . But just two days later, the reality of the consequences of such an operation began to settle in. Here is General Bonesteel’s memo penned just two days after the incident occurred: DoD As the days ticked by, North Korea didn’t change its overall military posture and they didn’t fly intercepts on other intelligence gathering assets that now either had fighter cover or had fighters waiting to launch in South Korea in a matter of minutes should they come under threat. Meanwhile, more air power was quietly moved into the region. Nixon was presented with a revised menu of options not just for responding to the downing of DEEP SEA 129 but also as a contingency for future aggressive acts by the North Koreans. The Administration was clearly caught off guard by the shoot down and they didn’t want that to happen again. The nuclear option was briefed as part of this options list, but the truth is that during this period the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to a North Korean act was always an option. Fighters sat on alert with B-61 nuclear bombs hung under them just for this purpose. Those weapons stayed in-theater till 1991. Nixon mulled these options over and decided that he wanted the option to order the destruction of the airfield where the jets originated from. He could either order the strike as a retaliatory move for the shooting down of the EC-121 or he could reserve the ability to quickly do so should North Korea lash out again by going after an aerial asset. Plans were put into action to move naval assets, including four aircraft carriers, into the waters off the Korean Peninsula so that the counter-attack could occur on short notice. The naval flotilla amassed off the Korean Peninsula was dubbed Task Force 71 and included carriers Enterprise , Ticonderoga , Ranger , Hornet, and the battleship USS New Jersey among many other cruisers, destroyers and frigates. It was one of the largest military shows of force of the entire Cold War period. Nixon never ordered the strike and North Korea didn’t make an attempt at another aircraft. Task Force 71 underway off the Korean coastline., USN Then and now In the end, the loss of DEEP SEA 129 and her crew of 31 was never avenged. In retrospect this might have avoided an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula while the U.S. was already buried deep in the conflict in Vietnam. Nearly 12,000 American servicemen died in Vietnam in 1969, and nearly 17,000 the year before. Another war, especially one as potentially bloody and costly as a conflict in Korea, would have been catastrophically unpopular back in the United States and even possibly unsustainable. Fast forward to today, a time when tensions are at their peak, and you wonder what would happen if the North Koreans took another shot at a U.S. military aircraft operating near their borders? Nixon was widely praised for his restraint, although this was at the height of the Vietnam War when anti-military sentiment was prevalent. Would President Trump be equally celebrated for similar actions today? Also, Trump and Nixon are very different people, and their responses to such a crisis would also likely be very different. The command and control architecture available to the Command in Chief today is also far superior to the rickety one that failed the Nixon Administration immediately following the shoot-down. A couple of days “cooling off” time really helped deescalate the situation even among America’s top commanders in the region. Today, President Trump would have the military capacity to react nearly instantly—at least within a matter of hours following such a tragedy. This may be a technological blessing but could it also be a geopolitical curse? One thing is certain, it’s amazing how little things seemed to have changed when it comes to North Korea in the nearly 50 years that separate the loss of DEEP SEA 129 and today. On the other hand North Korea is a nuclear power now and any counter strike could result in the use of these devastating weapons—a sobering and hard to quanitfy reality that Nixon and his generals didn’t have to face in 1969.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Video About The Navy’s Decaying Shipyards Makes Its 355 Ship Goal Seem Laughable,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have often talked about the Pentagon’s chronic disinterest in taking care of and making ready for combat the weapons it already has before buying new and even more costly ones. This culture of prioritization of procurement of new hardware over the readiness and maintenance of hardware has improved somewhat under Defense Secretary Mattis, but it still remains a looming issue as the services say they don’t have enough money to be ready for the wars of today and arm themselves for the wars of tomorrow. Fixation on arbitrary hardware goals can magnify this issue as procurement of weapon systems to meet those goals without even having a plan to support them once they are in inventory can lead to waste on a massive scale. Take the Navy’s proposed 355 ship fleet . This goal, supposedly to be obtained in the coming decade or two, is what the Navy says it needs to meet its increasing mission demands around the globe. This sounds all well and good, but upon closer examination the goal seems to be more of a monolithic gimmick than a rational strategy as there are so many other factors to take into account when fielding a force to meet future demands than just volume of hulls and force mix. One of those factors is the capacity of the Navy’s shipyards to handle such a fleet. Ships, especially highly complex ones, require massive amounts of maintenance to remain viable. Without that maintenance they turn into floating hulks, and the world’s most expensive ones at that. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Navy’s fleet dreams far outmatch their investments in the critical but unglamorous infrastructure needed to support them. The GAO has put out a fabulous and troubling video on the subject that is really a must watch: In detailing the realities of the Navy’s decaying naval yards, the GAO also seems to be inadvertently underlining just how strangely out of touch the Navy is with the plausibility of its own banner strategic policy. Just a few highlights from the short video: At one time the Navy had 13 shipyards, but now it has just four. None of these facilities were built to sustain a modern Navy. There is nearly a $5B maintenance backlog alone and this estimate is likely far less than the actual cost. Uses old inadequate equipment on high-tech vessels. Drydocks are on average 89 years old and are in poor condition. Due to the lack of dry dock capacity, the Navy won’t be able to perform a third of its scheduled aircraft carrier and submarine maintenance projects over the next two decades. Rising sea levels pose a threat to old dry docks. The Navy says it will take nearly two decades to address these issues, but GAO says it will take longer. By that time the fleet will have ballooned putting more pressure on these tired facilities. As of now the Navy is only funding roughly half the cost just to keep up maintenance on their own naval shipyards. USN The GAO has issued a full report on this problem and it outlines far more than the video includes. From its highlights page: “Similarly, a Navy analysis shows that the average age of shipyard capital equipment now exceeds its expected useful life.Partly as a result of their poor condition, the shipyards have not been fully meeting the Navy’s operational needs. In fiscal years 2000 through 2016, inadequate facilities and equipment led to maintenance delays that contributed in part to more than 1,300 lost operational days—days when ships were unavailable for operations—for aircraft carriers and 12,500 lost operational days for submarines (see figure). The Navy estimates that it will be unable to conduct73 of 218 maintenance periods over the next 23 fiscal years due to insufficient capacity and other deficiencies. Though the Navy has developed detailed plans for capital investment in facilities and equipment at the shipyards that attempt to prioritize their investment strategies, this approach does not fully address the shipyards’ challenges, in part because the plans are missing key elements. Missing elements include analytically-based goals and metrics, a full identification of the shipyards’ resource needs, regular management reviews of progress, and reporting on progress to key decision makers and Congress. For example, the Navy estimates that it will need at least $9.0 billion in capital investment over the next12 fiscal years, but this estimate does not account for all expected costs, such as those for planning and modernizing the shipyards’ utility infrastructure. Unless it adopts a comprehensive, results-oriented approach to addressing its capital investment needs, the Navy risks continued deterioration of its shipyards, hindering its ability to efficiently and effectively support Navy readiness over the long term.” You can read the full report here, but suffice it to say this damning review puts the Navy’s ability to sustain a 355 ship Navy in question, that is if it can actually procure one. As we have learned all too well, continued high-tempo operational rates and further deferred maintenance will only magnify the issue. The solution to the issue is creating a realistic direct investment structure for these facilities that targets long-term usability over short-term fixes. Without really tackling the problem the Navy can buy all the ships it wants, but it won’t be able to keep them operational. This especially affects the US nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier fleets, both of which are set to grow in the near term and are absolutely critical to national security. USS City of Corpus Christi in Pearl Harbor’s Dry Dock 1., USN The big questions that the report doesn’t address are not only how did the Navy’s shipyards even get to this state of decay, but how on earth did the Navy brass think they could sustain their 355 ship fleet without emergency investments into them? Was this just nearsighted incompetence or an attempt for a handout to the shipbuilding industry on a massive scale? Regardless, these facilities are an embarrassment. We expect to see this type of thing in Russia, not in facilities that are critical to supporting the world’s most powerful and technologically advanced Navy. The Navy should be totally realistic about this issue and cut procurement if they have to in order to rapidly update these facilities to more modern and sustainable standards. Doing it piecemeal over decades is not the answer. Cut the LCS buy to one less ship a year to make it happen. That would be a far more logical and beneficial investment in the Navy’s future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 27, 2017",Top General Confirms White House Axed New Air Force One’s Aerial Refueling Capability,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that it was indeed the White House, not the Air Force, that cut the ability to mid-air refuel from the Air Force One replacement program requirements. Oriana Pawlyk of Military.com broke the story today after Senator Tom Cotton questioned the Pentagon’s top uniformed official on the necessity to be able to keep the aircraft airborne in the event of a nuclear strike. Dunford replied: “I think that was a decision that was not made by the Air Force, but made by the White House, and I think it had to do with the fiscal constraints on the program… That will certainly be a limiting factor, and we’ll have to plan accordingly.” The Senator replied: “I think we may have to revisit that decision here on Capitol Hill.” You can watch the entire exchange here: We discussed how absurd President Trump’s singling out of the Air Force One replacement program was when it originally made headlines, along with the 45th President’s long history with big jets and aviation in general. More recently, The War Zone’s Joe Trevithick highlighted how cutting arbitrarily from the Air Force One replacement program, including axing its aerial refueling capability , based solely on political motivations is not only self defeating, it can also be dangerous in terms of national security: “Now, it appears that the U.S. Air Force is slashing key requirements, including mid-air refueling, for its new presidential aircraft, the future Air Force Ones , to try and make good on his claim about cutting the cost of the program by $1 billion… …Mid-air refueling is essential for the aircraft to be able to play its part in the “continuity of government” mission – which you can read about in depth here – and operate in the most demanding situations, including a nuclear apocalypse. That no president has had to use it would be something to be thankful for, not an excuse to get rid of it. Without an integral aerial refueling system, the president would have to rely on another aircraft, most likely the E-4B Nightwatch airborne command post or a future replacement for it, during an actual emergency. In turn, this would mean that one of these aircraft would have to shadow Air Force One at all times, not just on long-distance trips, or risk having to rendezvous with the president on the ground somewhere, the very kind of scenario the refueling system is there to prevent from ever happening in the first place. At present, during domestic flights, the Air Force usually dispatches one of its secretive C-20C aircraft, but this small business jet sized aircraft is a poor substitute for Air Force One and wouldn’t be able to provide nearly the same capabilities or protection during a major incident, such as a nuclear attack. Aerial refueling gives the president and his staff time to best assess their options. Without it, despite the fact that the 747-8i, with its engines, offers more than 3 hours of additional flight time, the crew would be on a very fixed timetable to figure things out… …Whether the goal [of saving around $1B on the program] itself is worth the effort is debatable from a practical point of view. There’s no real suggestion that Air Force One’s costs were seriously “out of control” as Trump had suggested, especially compared to other ongoing projects , even if there is always a very real possibility for feature creep in defense programs. Shaving a quarter of the cost of the planes might sound nice in general, but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the Pentagon’s overall budget, which the Trump Administration insists it wants to increase dramatically anyways. In addition to being a relatively small portion of overall defense spending, Air Force One isn’t one of those things you want to cut just for the sake of cutting, either. If there are reasonable things to eliminate, then by all means they should go. The aerial refueling capability and environmental safety features are hardly superfluous, though. More to the point, adhering to an arbitrary number for purely political reasons, which seems from all accounts to be the real compelling issue for the Air Force here, should never be the motivation when making decisions that could put the president and his successors, who will likely be flying in the new Air Force Ones for decades to come, at unnecessary risk.” So we have Donald Trump setting the requirements for the VC-25As/Air Force One replacement program, if not in detail, than by making the USAF and Boeing deliver airplanes that he can say he saved a billion dollars on. It was a red herring from the start, and now it’s just lunacy. The VC-25s are aging but continue to be upgraded with the latest technologies . They may actually end up being far more survivable than their successors. , USAF Go ahead and redefine exactly what Air Force One needs to be. In fact, the Air Force is supposed to have a review going on for just that right now. But really, if the President wants to really save money than he or she can fly on the E-4B and E-6B replacement aircraft . Eliminate the Air Force One recap program and the idea of a dedicated Air Force One aircraft altogether. The President and his closest advisors can fly with him or her on the command post aircraft—which will include aerial refueling capability and all the hardened systems needed to survive a nuclear attack—while the press, political lackeys, and all the non-critical White House staff can fly on a USAF 737 or chartered aircraft. Such a plan would also allow for the E-4B and E-6B fleets to be recapitalized faster. Will they be as luxurious, specious, or prestigious as Air Force One? No, but they will serve as a clear sign that the President wants to lead from the front on cuts and he or she won’t sacrifice national security in the process. The Secretary of Defense uses the E-4Bs now for worldwide travel, so there is a clear precedent for using such an aircraft for execute airlift missions. Another route for truly saving money would be to sacrifice the four engine requirement for Air Force One and select a smaller aircraft that will be more affordable to purchase and operate. The 777 or a version of the KC-46A could work, but like going with an E-4 and E-6 replacement, it would be a tighter fit compared to 747-8i based Air Force One. The KC-46 derivative of the 767 has already been militarized and gone through testing associated with that process.  They would also offer commonality with over 100 tankers that will be fielded by the USAF in the coming years. The current plan being executed by the USAF under Trump uses “orphaned” 747-8i airframes instead of new build aircraft to save money. This seems like a good move at face value, but retrofitting these aircraft with so many specialized systems—including being hardened against electromagnetic pulses given off by detonating nuclear warheads—could end up costing more than just buying spec’d out new airframes in the first place. We just don’t know for sure how much this procurement decision is supposed to save as the Air Force forthcoming with costs for the program. KC-46 undergoes testing in the massive Benefield Anechoic Facility at Edwards AFB. The type could replace America’s fleet of “Doomsday Planes” which could also carry the President on his travels., USAF You can buy undelivered airplanes, but when it comes to key capabilities and subsystems, you can’t cut corners with Air Force One. And it’s not just about protecting the President, its about protecting the continuity of the office . These aircraft are dressed-up survivable command posts that hold the credibility of our nuclear deterrent on their wings. Stripping them down of their core survivability systems is simply not acceptable—and aerial refueling is one of those core systems. Now we have the Air Force scrambling to make an off the cuff promise by Trump a reality, and so far it’s just this and the F-35 program that seem to get his attention, with a little bit of Ford class supercarrier thrown in. And as Joe mentioned earlier, these aircraft will have to be viable for many decades to come, and upgrading them down the line to what should have been their original configurations would likely be extremely expensive and time consuming. In the end, all this is a counter-productive distraction, but one that does actually matter. Hopefully Congress can provide some oversight here as the USAF doesn’t seem ready to make a fight out of the issue. In the end, the aircraft will likely have aerial refueling and other critical systems returned to its specifications, but it will take an unneeded Capitol Hill conflict to see that it does.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 27, 2017",All The Revelations From Hours Of Testimony By The Pentagon’s Top Uniformed Officer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, is up for another term as the top uniformed officer in the entire United States military. He is sure to get another two years in the position as the straight talking Marine is widely respected and is known to work especially well with Secretary of Defense James Mattis. But that doesn’t mean the normal congressional protocol was waived, Dunford still has to make his rounds on Capitol Hill as part of the reappointment process. Yesterday the Senate Armed Services Committee had Dunford testify, which was a free-for-all question and answer session that hit on pretty much every topic related to America’s armed forces. It offered a fascinating and up to date illustration not only of Dunford’s thoughts on key issues, but also on the state of the Pentagon and its campaigns around the globe. AP We already talked about one of the revelations that has come out of the hearing, now here are all the other carefully curated highlights and need to know details from nearly three hours of Dunford’s testimony: On North Korea: Whether it’s six months or 18 months, it’s soon that Kim Jong Un will be able to reliably deliver a warhead to the United States mainland and we should be conducting ourselves as if it is a matter of a very short time before they get that capability. The General emphasized: “We should assume now today that North Korea has that capability and they are willing to use that capability.” Gathering intelligence on North Korea and its programs is an issue because they have buried many of their weapons development programs and capabilities deep underground. Adverse weather conditions can also limit collection abilities. Competing demand for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets is also a factor. Dunford further notes that for a long period of time the Pentagon decreased intelligence gathering capabilities in regards to North Korea due to other priorities but has since increased them once again. Recent operations conducted ( show of force flights ) involved General Dunford, SecDef Mattis, and PACOM commander Admiral Harris directly in the planning and approval process so as to mitigate risk of a mistake or misunderstanding that could lead to a conflict. Such a miscalculation is supposedly a big concern among the DoD brass. The U.S. has no form of direct communication with North Korea at this time. The military’s top leadership has made the conscious and coordinated decision not to use provocative terms that would exacerbate the crisis, especially those regarding destruction of the country and the regime, and to allow Secretary Tillerson to be the single source of messaging towards North Korea. He also noted that he “won’t comment on things that our senior political leadership have said.” In other words, Trump’s rhetoric and tweets are totally detached from this carefully planned messaging strategy. The regime’s nuclear and missile programs are an insurance policy for its survival. There is no preemptive strike option that doesn’t put Seoul at risk, but a credible military option has to be on the table. On Afghanistan: The general stated: “I do not believe we can attain our objectives in Afghanistan … Unless we materially change the behavior of Pakistan… It will require a broad approach to do it… It’s unacceptable that Pakistan provides sanctuary and we need to bring the full weight of the U.S. government and our coalition partners on Pakistan to ensure they do not provide the sanctuary that they have provided historically to groups like the Haqqani and the Taliban.” Missile Defense: An additional 21 ground based interceptors should be added to the 44 that are already deployed as outlined by the latest Pentagon budget draft. Boost phase intercept, either via airborne laser or interceptor, continues to evolve and is a priority developmentally, but no operational capability is available at this time. The U.S. military can protect Hawaii from a limited ICBM attack with the capabilities it has fielded today. On competitive advantage: We are clearly challenged in our ability to project power in Europe and the Pacific unlike we were a decade or two ago. Dunford said: “The Chinese the Russians and other have studied our strengths over the course of 20 years. They have been on a path of developing capabilities that exploit our vulnerabilities. We know what those are and we have a plan to correct those. But if we don’t correct those, our ability to project power… Is going to be challenged.” Don’t assume the following in the future without major investments in excess of what the Budget Control Act allows: Access to space. Ability to protect our networks—both military and commercial. Ability to counter our enemy’s electronic warfare capabilities. Defense against emerging ballistic and cruise missile threats. On what country poses the biggest threat to the U.S. today: “In terms of a sense of urgency today, North Korea poses the greatest threat today. In terms of overall military capability, I believe Russia poses the greatest threat because of their nuclear, cyber and electronic warfare, and any activity we have seen from Crimea to Ukraine. If I look out to 2025 and I look at the demographics and economic situation I think China poses the great threat to our nation by about 2025 and that’s consistent with much of our analysis.” On transgender service members: “I believe any individual that meets the physical and mental standards and is worldwide deployable and is currently serving should be afforded the opportunity to continue to serve… The advice I just articulated is what I have provided in private and I have now just provided it in public.” On Readiness: The general explained that a pilot that gets 15 hours a month of flight time instead of 30 hours a month will be far less capable of facing emergencies in the cockpit. We will probably never know about the emergency with the pilot that gets 30 hours a month in the air but we are more likely to with the one with the one that gets 15 hours a month because that emergency is more likely to result in a class A mishap (over $2M in damage or fatal). We use to train and deploy units based on their ability to reach a desired level of proficiency in certain tasks, now under the current operations tempo we train based on time—a ship is going to sea and the infantryman is going to go to war whether they are proficient in basic tasks or not. USS Barry was underway 70% of the time over the last 12 months, which is clearly unsustainable and puts into question the crew’s ability to train during that period as well as their very well being. On Syria and ISIS: In six months Dunford thinks the U.S. and its partners will have “completed operations more properly” in and around Raqqa and will be “well on our way” to going after ISIS’s external operations abilities and media operations in Syria. They won’t be able to claim they have a caliphate anymore and that will affect recruiting. Also, the U.S. will be working to help Iraq secure its western border from future infiltration by ISIS or other extremist elements. When asked if Assad needs to go in Syria, Dunford said: “Addressing the grievances of the civil war will be necessary to have a stable political construct” which sounds a lot like a yes. On Iran: Iran’s activity in Iraq has increased dramatically in recent weeks as an “end game” in regards to driving ISIS from the country draws near. Iran is complying with the Iranian nuclear deal. On Russia: Russia is in violation of the Open Skies Treaty and has been for some time now. The US is now going to limit Russia’s Open Skies flights. This is in reaction to Russia limiting our flights over Kaliningrad—Russia’s heavily armed enclave in Europe —as well as over Chechnya and South Ossetia. Russia even limited the altitude that the Open Skies aircraft could fly over Moscow during its photo run. Dunford believes the treaty would be best kept in place, but only if Russia abides by it. A diplomatic effort is underway to bring Russia back into compliance. Part of this effort includes restricting Russia’s access to overflights of Alaska and Washington DC. Russia gets more benefit from these flights than the U.S. does due to their far more limited spy satellite network. Adversarial competition short of armed conflict—in other words hybrid warfare with a focus on electronic, information, and cyber warfare—is now an area included in the Pentagon’s campaign planning process. Dunford also says he advises a “whole of government” approach to the issue which hints at supporting the congressional Russian investigation and whatever policy stems from it. On Ukraine: Dunford has recommended the U.S. provide lethal defensive armament to Ukraine. The final decision is now up to the White House. On acquisition: The ability to execute rapid acquisition programs has been a bright spot in the acquisition process, but finding the balance between going after rapidly acquired capabilities, many of which are commercially available off the shelf, has to be balanced with the development of higher-end capabilities that have a much longer gestation period.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Watch Safehaven Marine’s Stealthy Barracuda Patrol Boat Undergo Intense Boarding Trials,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Safehaven Marine is known for creating high performance boats that go where few other vessels can. I profiled the company’s 59 foot slender hull high-speed patrol boat Thunder Child , and before that I did a profile on Thunder Child’s little cousin, the stealthy Barracuda . Barracuda is progressing through testing and has recently undergone dynamic boarding trials that pushed the multi-purpose vessel to perform under potentially real world operational scenarios—namely zooming up alongside a much larger vessel and staying there long enough to deploy a boarding team of commandos. The black go fast used an Irish naval vessel as a target platform for the tests and Safehaven’s crew steadily pushed the speed of the trials up to 20 knots, which is quite fast considering such a maneuver would likely be performed against lumbering cargo ships or rickets dhows. Part of these type of tests are also aimed at seeing how the craft’s hullform interacts with the wake of a much larger ship as well as how well the boat will stand up to the beating it gets from smashing against the target vessel’s hull. When two vessels are close to one-another while underway, a suction effect can cause them to collide violently. As you can see in the video it is a dynamic affair to say the least. We reached out to Safehaven Marine about the tests and here’s what they said: “These were trials undertaken in collaboration with the Irish Naval service to determine Barracudas ability to undertake high speed boardings of large ships underway traveling at speeds of over 20kts. The scenario envisaged was an anti-terrorism exercise such as inserting a special forces team aboard a hijacked ship. The trials demonstrated Barracudas ability to offer a stable and secure platform to undertake boardings, very much in the manner a pilot boat transfers pilots to ships, and be able to do so offshore safely in potentially much rougher sea conditions than would be possible with the typical RIB used by special forces in this scenario. The trials were very successful and clearly demonstrate Barracudas abilities in this respect.” Safehaven Marine has long claimed that the Barracuda has a reduced radar cross section, so boarding operations, especially those conducted at night, would be a key feature for special operations applications, where sneaking up on a target with dramatically reduced warning would be highly beneficial. As for the future of Barracuda and what production units will cost, Safehaven Marine told The War Zone the following: “We have various lines of enquiry for the barracuda range not just the 11m version. Mainly military. Price is dependent on the spec required which can differ significantly.” Barracuda’s big brother, Thunder Child , is also progressing through testing. Check out these videos of the vessel’s crazy storm conditions testing and capsizing trials, as well as its record setting run around Ireland: That is one vessel that doesn’t like being upside down in the water! Thunder Child is such a gorgeous vehicle, it looks like it is just begging to go fast, and the fact that it can survive some of the toughest conditions the sea can throw at it is really an accomplishment. Clearly the innovation involved with these vessels springs from the fact that Safehaven Marine’s team seems to absolutely love what they do and are totally passionate about the hardcore maritime vessels they produce. Keep an eye Barracuda and Thunder Child , I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more of them in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the world’s largest aircraft, the An-124 Condor , made its grand arrival at St. Maarten’s famous Princess Juliana Airport today. Owned and operated by Ukraine’s Antonov Airlines, the transport made the flight from the Dutch island of Curacao, which is located off the northern tip of Venezuela. The one hour and 34 minute flight covered roughly 560 miles—a relatively short hop for the An-124. The aircraft carried emergency supplies for storm ravaged St. Maarten, including a number of garbage trucks which will clearly be invaluable when it comes to the cleanup and rebuilding effort. A unique arrival to the island like this would not be complete without a video of the moment shot from Maho Beach—possibly the most famous plane spotting location in the entire world. Check out the video of the Condor’s up-close and personal landing below: The An-124’s departure wasn’t as dramatic as the jet was empty and only flying a short 30 minute leg to the island of St. Johns. When loaded up, they are known to use a lot of pavement to claw their way into the air. The damage on St. Maarten is bewildering, with 90% of all structures damaged or destroyed and 30% totally destroyed. Aircraft have been a key lifeline for the island, and there has been a near constant stream of airlifters making their way to and from the island in recent weeks. These aircraft have brought critical supplies needed to sustain St. Maarten’s citizens as well as evacuating some residents and visitors. Aside from the military aircraft and chartered flights, Samaritan’s Purse has made runs to the isalnd with their gorgeous DC-8. Here is a Armée de l’Air, A400M arriving at the island with supplies: With so much destruction in the region from multiple hits by some of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history, international aid can’t be concentrated on just one locale. Making things worse, with the U.S. facing its own harrowing aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, resources that could otherwise be brought to bear on islands like St. Maarten are being diverted to the American territory. But there are some good signs, one of which is that airplane spotters are already back on what’s left of Maho Beach, capturing the aviation action. If anything this is at least an obscure sign that things are slowly returning to some form of normalcy, although there is clearly a long and arduous road for the island paradise.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 12, 2025",Mattis Used The USAF’s Flying Airstream Trailer “Silver Bullet” Pod On Afghanistan Trip,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of Defense Mattis just visited Afghanistan, where he had a very unwelcoming arrival thanks to RPG and mortar slinging Taliban insurgents. The Pentagon’s top civilian leader took a C-17 into the war torn country for good reason. The C-17 can maneuver hard within the tight confines of an airfield’s perimeter to execute tactical approaches and departures, and most importantly, they are equipped with an advanced countermeasures suite. This defensive suite includes multiple types of expendable decoys and the latest version of the laser-based Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure System (LAIRCM). This system uses staring missile launch detectors arrayed around the aircraft that alert the crew of an incoming missile via detection of the missile’s infrared plume and cue a number of laser turrets positioned around the jet’s fuselage to fire their blinding beams into the missile’s infrared seeker. This is a capability that most USAF airlifters now have to varying degrees, as well as some USAF VIP transports. The VC-25As that provide Presidential airlift as Air Force One are covered in the Direction Infrared Counter-Measures (DIRCM) turrets and the C-32As that often act as Air Force Two also have an enhanced version of the system. Some C-37s and C-40s sport less elaborate LAIRCM installations as well. But the latest C-17 LAIRCM outfits are among the most capable and combine their defensive abilities with the C-17s maneuverability and hardy airframe. Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24 DIRCM turrets have becoming incredibly miniaturized over the last decade or so., Northrop Grumman The Secretary of Defense’s usual ride, the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) doesn’t benefit from an elaborate infrared countermeasures suite and these aging aircraft have limited availability . But that doesn’t mean the Pentagon’s head honcho has to sit in an airliner seat bolted down in the C-17’s cargo hold the entire flight into a war zone. Instead he gets to use one of the Air Force’s two customized airstream VIP “Command and Control” (C2) pods aptly nicknamed “Silver Bullets.” You can see the missile launch detector and the LAIRCM turret flanking the C-17’s main passenger door at the start of the video: The Silver Bullets came out of a USAF Research Lab initiative dating back to around 1990. The idea was to get something modular that could provide a VVIP/distinguished guest the privacy required to discuss sensitive matters, while also being comfortable enough for them to relax or get work done while en route to a destination. Above all else they had to offer the connectivity required to provide officials with multiple forms of communications to the outside world. In addition, these “pods” of sorts had to be relatively affordable, so starting from scratch really didn’t make sense. A 36 foot Airstream trailer was used as a starting point, with the trailer being turned into a three sectioned pod mounted on 12 foot long cargo pallets. The Airstream’s wheels, towing system, fuel tanks, and environmental systems were stripped and its shell was heavily insulated to work as something akin to a mobile SCIF . An arsenal of communications tech was integrated into the pod as well. Selectech This included multiple radio and satellite systems for unsecure and secure voice, data, and video teleconferencing. These systems “plug in” to the existing communications systems aboard a select number of C-17s—supposedly it can be flown aboard some KC-10s as well—via a set of umbilical cables. There is a large “mechanical caboose” that brings up the rear of the palleted Silver Bullet system where the technology and controls that support the pod are held and where the pod’s electronics are interfaced with the C-17. The updated version of this enclosure is called the “Silver Eagle” and it can support communications at the very highest levels. The elite 21st Air Mobility Operations Squadron “Mobsters” mans the Silver Eagle system during deployments. A very rare view inside the “Silver Eagle.”, Selectech According to a section on the C-17’s future upgrade path within the Air Mobility Command’s official history report that the The War Zone obtained through the Freedom Of Information Act, the aircraft that can interface with the Silver Bullets have to be equipped with Secure En Route Communications Package (SECOMP) and Special Operations Low Level II (SOLL II) installation. McGuire AFB has C-17As—and presumably KC-10s—that are uniquely outfitted to support special operations missions and are equipped with these systems. Rumsfeld used the Silver Bullets often on his trips abroad. Notice the Silver Bullet’s floor safe for top secret information., David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images Even with all this high-tech communications gear, the largely windowless pods still look like recreational vehicles inside, with somewhat “quaint” wood finishing and leather accruements. They include a small galley, bathroom with shower, conference and office area and a sleeping/lounge area. Judging by the picture of Mattis inside the Silver Bullet on his trip to Afghanistan, we can tell that they have received a substantial electronics upgrade somewhat recently. Secretary Gates conducting a meeting in the lounge area of the pod. In total the Silver Bullet can seat around 10. , DoD Outside of the pods, in the aircraft’s cavernous cargo hold, life goes on for aids and other passengers, with the Silver Bullet acting as an executive cocoon of sorts. Because they are not certified by the FAA, occupants can’t hang out inside of them during takeoff or landing. During those terminal operations they buckle into a seat just like everyone else but during cruise they have no real reason to leave as the pods even have oxygen at the ready for an emergency decompression situation and a direct line to the cockpit. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates holding a meeting inside the conference/office area of the Silver Bullet. , USAF One of the units was originally based at Yokota Air Base in Japan but now they are both based at McGuire AFB in New Jersey and are maintained by the 605th Air Maintenance Squadron and operated by the 621st Air Mobility Operations Squadron. A crew of three accompanies each pod, which includes two stewards and a communications specialist to help operate the pod’s technical systems. The Silver Bullets have seen use by a long list of officials and even celebrities. Beyond the Secretary of Defense, these have included Vice Presidents—most notably Dick Cheney who used the Silver Bullet extensively, the secretaries of the various services, Secretary of State, high-up military commanders, senators, and even Robin Williams and Drew Carey have used the mobile apartments of sorts during their travels to visit troops in war zones for the USO. AP The Air Force has tried for over a decade to replace the Silver Bullets with something more lavish, certified for all phases of flight, and more technologically advanced. Two related programs from around 2008 drew disdain from government oversight group and the media . One was to produce a palleted system for “world class” first class style seating for VIPs called the Senior Leader In-transit Pallet (SLIP). The other program was to develop an enclosed executive suite called the Senior Leader In-transit Conference Capsule (SLICC). The SLICC (left) and SLIP (right)., Selectech These systems could fit on C-130s, KC-135s, KC-10s, and C-17s and could be linked together. The cost first the for the initial four SLIPs and one SLICC was said to have grown to nearly $5M, with the first SLICC, which includes a “comfort” capsule and a “conference capsule” that can be mated together, costing nearly three million by itself. The four SLIPs, which consist of just four chairs and a table area, would cost an incredible $415K each, or over $100k a seat. Different proposed configurations for the SLICC system on different aircraft., Selectech Pogo noted the following on its blog in July of 2008: “The program began under General Duncan McNabb’s tenure as commander of Air Mobility Command, a part of the Air Force that is responsible for air transport. General McNabb originally sought ten SLICCs and was involved in choosing the original color and material choices for the SLICC and SLIP leather, wood and carpet, which General Robert H. McMahon later changed at the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Disgust towards the generals’ requests grew inside the Air Force, leading the acquisition effort to be moved when one part of Air Mobility Command refused to make some of the costly changes . “In Mar 07, Gen McMahon requested A4 [Air Mobility Command’s Logistics Directorate] take over the acquisition effort when he could not get support from A5 [AMC’s Plans and Programs Directorate] for updates and cooperation on making the equipment ‘world class’ which was one of his goals,” according to an Air Force email . In one email it states , “Gen McMahon’s concern is so significant that we need assurance by the end of the week from AFRL [Air Force Research Laboratory] that the SLICC will be ‘World class’ inside.  While we know the requirements document says ‘business class’, we all know there are levels of that.” The “world class” emphasis entailed the costly aesthetic redesign of the interior of an already existing system known as Steel Eagle.  After the first SLIP was procured, General McMahon expressed dissatisfaction with the color of the seat leather and type of wood used.  He directed that the leather be reupholstered from brown to Air Force blue leather and to replace the wood originally used to cherry. The cost alone to reupholster the seats on the first SLIP is about $21,000 – one estimate of the total cost of wood and leather changes to all the first four SLIPs (16 chairs total) was about $113,000.  The cost was so appalling to General Kenneth Merchant that he wrote , “How’d we get to $113K for 4 pallets? Pls tell me this is for all 4 pallets…I could carpet and upholster a couple of houses for $113K…” (ellipses in original) As of March this year, the total cost increase for retrofit and further customization –which goes beyond wood and leather – for the SLIPs, directed by Air Mobility Command headquarters, is $493,000… …The money wasted here is a symbol of the disconnected and out-of-touch brass within the Air Force.  Certainly there were some good guys here with a sense of perspective. As you can see above, General Kenneth Merchant had enough gumption to ask why these changes cost so much.  But he was in the minority.  Knowledge of the acquisition went even above General McNabb — then-Chief of Staff T. Michael “Buzz” Moseley was briefed on the SLICC program.  And as an email states , “the expectation was high” for the program. As readers of this blog well know , Moseley was canned by Defense Secretary Robert Gates about a month ago.” This now infamous image of Hillary Clinton, then Secretary of State, checking her Blackberry also shows her sitting in one of the SLIP’s seats. , AP It does appear as if these programs made it at least through their initial order phase as SLIPs have been seen in use before. Hillary Clinton sat on one on her trip to Libya in 2011 and John Kerry was also photographed using SLIPs during his time as Secretary of State. It appears as if at least one SLIP was procured, but there seems to be no mention of it being used or photos of it being deployed operationally. This doesn’t necessarily mean it isn’t in still service to some capacity though. It appears at least one SLICC was built, although it is unclear if it is in use. , Selectech DoD The program was renamed the Roll-On Conference Capsule (ROCC) in 2017 and an official request for proposal was filed last June. The system could be used for more extensive command and control purposes than just for carting VIPs and commanders around, even working as a staffed mobile command center during specific operations or emergencies. The official statement of work attached to the program opens with the following: “The ROCC will replace legacy Silver Bullet Modules, which are modified Airstream trailers that the USG has certified for transportation on mobility aircraft as cargo only.  The project sponsor is Air Mobility Command.  The acquirer is C‐17 Systems Program Office (SPO), which is part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Mobility Directorate.  End user customers of the ROCC are senior leaders of the US Department of Defense and their travel teams. Other USG agencies such the State Department may also use the ROCC. Supporting agencies include the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Air Transportation Test Loading Agency (ATTLA). The planned operating site for ROCC is at Joint Base Andrews, MD, and the planned depot maintenance site is at Wright Patterson AFB, OH.” As to whether or not the USAF will be successful this time in replacing the Silver Bullets, we can’t be sure. VIP travel is under a microscope in Washington DC once again , and the President himself isn’t immune to the issue . In general, the concept of public officials using government or government chartered aircraft, especially lavish ones, has become an increasingly hot button topic over the last couple of decades. Still, the Secretary of Defense in particular has to stay in contact at all times to serve in the role of the second half of the National Command Authority . Should the President make the call to release nuclear weapons, the SecDef has to be there to give secondary approval, and having some sort of area and communications architecture conducive to that scenario is important while traveling. In the meantime, the now somewhat wholesome Silver Bullets, with their ugly drapes and dated wood interior, will soldier on carrying America’s most powerful figures in and out of war zones around the globe. Author’s note for correction: Silver Bullet operations have moved to Andrews AFB. The pods are maintained by the 89th Maintenance Group and the Steel Eagle comms unit is maintained by the 89th Communications Squadron. In flight support is provided by both 99th and 1st Airlift Squadrons. No C-17s are assigned to Andrews, so the aircraft are still pulled from bases with properly equipped aircraft. Considering that their mission is VIP transport, moving the pods to Andrews AFB makes a lot of sense.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Let’s Talk About The Supposed Sighting Of A Skunk Works Hypersonic Test Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aviation Week posted an online article last week that pointed once again to the possibility of accelerated development of a Lockheed Skunk Works designed hypersonic aircraft, now widely known as the SR-72. But the report not only talked about industry buzz and hints from Lockheed that the program may be more mature than originally thought, it also conveyed a sighting account of a demonstrator aircraft. Last June I wrote an article about just this topic, titled What’s The Deal With Lockheed’s Gabbing About The Secretive Hypersonic SR-72? In it I concluded that the string of strange statements and outright hype about the supposedly top secret program that had trickled out from Lockheed to a lone source at Aviation Week seemed peculiar enough to conclude that the so called SR-72 was likely much farther along in its development than what was being insinuated: “All things considered, we are, and have been hearing a tremendous amount of information about what is clearly a highly classified program, coming from the contractor directly no less. This is highly peculiar. And parts of this technology have been in the works for decades. The “combined cycle” propulsion system capable of taking an aircraft from sitting on the runway well through mach five has been in development since at least the mid 2000s by Lockheed and its partner on the project Aerojet Rocketdyne. Additionally, past hypersonic vehicle tests by the USAF have also garnered valuable insights into this extreme flight environment, and there are likely many other major breakthroughs gained over the years from programs we know nothing about. So why are we getting bread crumb trails dropped to Aviation Week periodically as to the maturity of the technology and the program? Doing so seems like a very strange move considering we don’t even hear a peep about far less exotic technological developments—like the existence of advanced unmanned combat air vehicles for instance. I would posit that it is very possible the Skunk Works and its USAF partners are actually farther along in the SR-72’s development than they let on. Possibly even past the point of a small demonstrator, and already fielding a full-size prototype, or even an operational capability. In other words, what we may be hearing about are post-dated echoes of the program’s past. The only other reason as to why Lockheed would be so willing to blabber about their hypersonic flying unicorn is that they need money from Uncle Sam to fund it. But that seems unlikely as it is highly doubtful the company has funded the concept’s development for over a decade on its own, beyond a relatively small amount of money granted by NASA to explore the technology. In fact, Weiss says that Lockheed is not alone on the project in any way in his latest statement, noting that “DARPA and the services” are directly involved.” …Considering how competent Lockheed and their Air Force colleagues are at keeping secrets , the SR-72’s strange “gray world” existence makes little sense. And hey, something has to live in that huge new remote hangar at Area 51 right? Maybe that facility’s tenant is the aircraft being described still as a “paper concept” here today. In the end, I would suggest being open to taking SR-72 related news as more of an indication of what is, instead of what could be.” Months later, Aviation Week seems to be pushing a similar narrative outright, and not only that, they even published the description of a supposed sighting of a hypersonic demonstrator with remarkably few caveats, with the latest Aviation Week article stating: “ Lockheed Martin is ramping up development of hypersonic system technology as observers report the first sightings of a demonstrator vehicle believed to be linked to the Skunk Works’ planned SR-72 high-speed aircraft project… …According to information provided to Aviation Week, one such technology demonstrator, believed to be an unmanned subscale aircraft, was observed flying into the U.S. Air Force’s Plant 42 at Palmdale, where Skunk Works is headquartered. The vehicle, which was noted landing in the early hours at an unspecified date in late July, was seen with two T-38 escorts. Lockheed Martin declined to comment directly on the sighting.” We have no clue where, or more accurately who Aviation Week got this report from but it has spread through the aviation and defense communities like wildfire. The problem with publishing something like this without the author providing further context is that it is taken by many as fact, which it is not. The sighting itself, as described, has its own issues. First off, we have no index regarding the quality of the source. Second, if they did indeed see a clandestine aircraft, how would they even know what they were looking at and be able to decipher the aircraft’s specific mission or affiliated program? We don’t know the exact design configuration of a hypersonic demonstrator even if it exists. All we have been told by Lockheed is that it would be approximately the size of an F-22. But even that could have changed. Additionally, as noted by the article, this sighting didn’t occur during daylight hours, so how did the viewer even make out enough details on the aircraft to be able to make a guess as to its origins one way or another? Lockheed/DARPA Then there is the question of who the aircraft even belonged to if the sighting of something previously undisclosed did indeed occur. Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed all have massive compounds at Plant 42. The airfield is huge. Even seeing where an aircraft taxis to from an approach end of one of its runways is questionable, especially for a clandestine test article flying in low light conditions. Even the T-38 element of the story seems a little odd. Chase is usually provided by F-16s these days, although Boeing owns T-38 chase aircraft as does NASA—both of which have a large presence at Plant 42. Edwards AFB to the north of Palmdale also has T-38s assigned, although once again, they aren’t used for chase duties of high performance aircraft like the F-16s are. Once again, the quality of the source is key here. If it was a bystander/layman the whole thing is highly speculative as normal people misidentify familiar aircraft in broad daylight, let alone in the dark. Although it would be a much more reliable source, it is doubtful that is was someone from inside Plant 42’s fence line, as blabbering about this kind of thing is not conducive to employment for most jobs there. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, just not probable. If the sighting is true, and some exotic test aircraft did fly back to Plant 42 instead of being shipped there as is known to be common, it could have belonged to Boeing or Northrop Grumman, not just Lockheed Martin. And above all else, how is it certain that what the person saw was indeed a high-speed demonstrator instead of one of a whole slew of rumored black programs or ones that otherwise remain totally unknown? Also, it is worth noting, that there have been no other major sightings of such an aircraft in recent months, at least any that are rumored to have occurred and discussed within the communities of people who have high-interest in this type of thing—something we here at The War Zone monitor very closely. So this sighting appears to be unique if it is truly accurate. None of this is to say that a hypersonic technology demonstrator isn’t flying, or hasn’t been for some time. Once again, we surmised as such months ago. It’s just this sighting account was conveyed with such little detail that its validity is highly questionable. As we have discussed in the past, by most indications there are a whole slew clandestine flight test programs underway at any given time, and if the account is to be believed, any one of these could have been the aircraft in question. We don’t even have a description of the aircraft spotted. But there can be no doubt that the Pentagon is becoming highly concerned with America’s “hypersonic gap” as its peer state competitors forge ahead quickly with the game-changing technology . So far it seems that America’s potential foes have concentrated on the development of hypersonic cruise missile technology. With the USAF feeling behind the curve, a hypersonic platform, a reusable aircraft capable of launching its own weapons and carrying reconfigurable sensors, is likely a prime developmental target that can close that gap and reach a position of superiority in the hypersonic realm in one fell swoop. So as we said months ago, could there be a hypersonic demonstrator aircraft our there? Yes. In fact it seems more probable than possible, and this aircraft could have existed in the past, not the present. But is the supposed sighting at Plant 42 as reported by Aviation Week further evidence of its existence? Without more details, no it is not.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 23, 2018",Trump Suddenly Starts Blabbering About The F-35 During Puerto Rico Recovery Meeting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what turned out to be a bizarre congratulatory set piece presser of sorts under the wing of a Puerto Rico Air National Guard C-130, the 45th President of the United States suddenly went off track and began talking about the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter—an aircraft that has zero to do with horrible devastation, squalid living conditions, or recovery efforts on the storm ravaged island. Trump, who has been harshly criticized for his response to the disaster, as well as his messaging that targeted local officials who didn’t sing its praises, said the following during the highly anticipated visit to the island: “Amazing job, and amazing job. So amazing that we’re ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. Do you like the F-35? I said how does it do it in fights, and how do they do in fights with the F-35. He says we do very well, you can’t see it. Literally you can’t see. It’s hard to fight a plane you can’t see right? But that’s an expensive plane you can’t see. And as you probably heard we cut the price very substantially, something other administrations would never have done, that I can tell you.” The totally off-base remarks came after asking for some words on the USAF’s part in the recovery. You can watch the strange moment and the entire event below (starts at around 14:10 if the video doesn’t advance on its own): First off, the whole display was totally tone deaf. The people of Puerto Rico are really in a bad place and Trump’s seems to only have one speed, which is one of congratulations as if he is at some sort of corporate awards dinner. But that aside, why in the hell is talking about the F-35 during a meeting on disaster relief in Puerto Rico? Stating proudly that the government is going to spend “hundreds of millions” on new aircraft for the USAF when that same government’s willingness to rebuild key infrastructure on the island is in doubt is beyond stupid. People could care less about a stealth fighter program when they have no roof, no power, and no potable water. What’s worse is that he repeats the fallacy that he saved so much money on the program by picking up the phone and wheeling and dealing out of his pocket. This simply is not true. MANDEL NGAN/ Contributor / Getty Images As we said in a past article about another of Trump’s ramblings on the F-35: “I really don’t want to rehash the whole “Trump saved millions per F-35” fiasco but lets just say, he didn’t . But the defense industry, which has little shame in licking boots to make a buck, played to his ego so he could say he did. Scary… …It is pretty clear Trump has been personally spoon-fed the F-35 brochure from LockMart and the program office. Without any point of reference, it all must seem pretty wondrous. Oh and the program he was so critical of during his campaign is now magically fixed because he made a phone call. Totally ridiculous to the point that its downright insulting. And really, nothing of this has to do with the jet itself, just a new slathering of politics that surrounds it. To be honest, I had high hopes that Trump could spur systemic change within the DoD’s procurement process. Those hopes have faded rapidly over the last three months. It seems that he is far more interested in selectively intervening in a few high-profile programs he has interest in so that he can claim fake victories and gloat about them endlessly to the press, and the defense industry is happy to oblige him if it means funding certainty and a strong order book. As Trump would put it: “sad.”” It would be nice, just for once, to hear something of substance, something that shows some level of information retention on a major issue from this President. Just getting the same old congratulations game or vague talking points is becoming tiresome. Especially when it comes to something like this, a far from highly scientific issue and one that effects Americans lives right here and now. Instead we get boasting about buying throngs of expensive stealth fighter jets. Sickening.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 25, 2018",USAF May Dump Its E-8C JSTARS Replacement Program For A Shadowy “Distributed” Solution,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the hottest USAF acquisition programs that’s underway is the one to recapitalize the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) fleet that has been based around 16 rickety old 707s for over two and a half decades. Three teams have been vying for the contract led by prime aircraft manufacturers Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. And although the JSTARS replacement system will house radars that specialize in ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture surveillance capabilities just like its predecessor, they will also have a greater ability to work as networking nodes and flying battle management centers. Recently the JSTARS recap program was thrown a curveball when the top rungs of the Pentagon’s leadership suddenly questioned the program’s direction and posited that maybe moving toward an interim “distributed” solution would be a better choice. The E-8C JSTARS are critical sensor and battlefield management platforms, but they use a very old and costly platform, the Boeing 707., USAF It’s still unclear if the program will continue as planned or if it will be delayed or even substituted for a different approach to the whole “battlefield surveillance command and control” (BSC2) mission set, or at least portions of it. Secretary of Defense Mattis said the following at the Air Force Association conference last month: “I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission… I’m eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.” Head of Air Combat Command General Mike Holmes also stated : “The question really is, how long do we continue to fund the GMTI [ground moving target indicator] capability in the classic way we’ve done it: with an integrated platform that has a sensor and air battle managers onboard… How much of our threat environment in the future will allow us to do that?” What they are likely talking about is a number of dispersed assets, namely unmanned aircraft, upgraded existing aircraft, and possibly satellites, that can “contribute” collectively to a common overall battlefield surveillance “picture,” with battle managers on the ground working the products from these systems. It sounds great but it also relies more heavily on potentially vulnerable data link communications than a centralized manned platform, like the JSTARS recap aircraft, would. The truth is that even a new JSTARS aircraft would still increasingly rely on these same types of “distributed” sensor platforms in the future as it will not be able to penetrate close enough to enemy airspace to put its own radar and sensor systems to use in an anti-access/aerial denial combat environment. But the radar is just one part of the puzzle, a new JSTARS aircraft will have the ability to manage these assets from afar and distribute their intelligence products to all types of users (ships, aircraft, ground units, high-level command and control etc) which is a proven concept. Also, a BSC2 aircraft can fly simpler missions more effectively than a big distributed “system of systems” as it packs the radar, the communications, and the command and control element all in one easily deployable package. So basically, when it comes to the debate over moving forward with a JSTARS recap aircraft or developing an interim distributed concept, we are talking about taking a centralized flying BSC2 node out of the game or not. The fact that the USAF brass may be willing to step away from a discreet BMC2 solution points to the existence of penetrating stealthy unmanned aircraft that can bring their sensors to bear deep within enemy territory. We know the RQ-170 Sentinel can do this on a localized tactical level, and it is thought that it carries a small radar system specifically capable of tracking patterns of life and collecting GMTI data. Larger clandestinely developed Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle like unmanned systems that could also provide this capability at a tactical level, but the USAF also has all but formally disclosed the existence of a high-flying strategic surveillance asset that can fly deep into contested airspace and loiter there for long periods of time without being detected and engaged. Unofficially dubbed the RQ-180 , this “Tier III” asset, supposedly created by Northrop Grumman, features broadband low observability and can fly at high altitudes for long periods of time. The best analogy is that it is likely akin to a very stealthy and deep penetrating RQ-4 Global Hawk, and its existence may have actually stymied the business case for an expanded Global Hawk fleet to some degree. This aircraft is thought to primarily use a low probability of intercept radar as its primary for GMTI and taking high-resolution radar images of the enemy battlespace. Passive signals intelligence sensors are sure to also be a major feature of the craft. But this system also likely has, or can have, the ability to act as a networking node for stealth combat aircraft, and would be able to port information from F-35s, F-22s, B-2s, and even swarming UCAVs , to satellites above and send it to various “fusion” centers where it can be rebroadcasted into the cockpits of less capable aircraft working in more permissive environments and be exploited by battlefield commanders in real time. It may also be able to facilitate, now or in the future, robust two-way communication and data sharing between stealthy assets, which each feature their own stealthy data-link waveforms and modems, working over contested airspace. Think of it as a high-flying universal translator similar to the E-11 BACN but for use in highly contested environments. The USAF new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, which is more of a multi-role platform than a traditional bomber, could also provide many of these capabilities as well, but it is a longer-lead capability that is not slated to comes online until well into the next decade. Notice how a stealthy flying wing (shown as a B-2) is pictured above the stealth assets (F-35, F-22, UCAVS) acting as a communications gateway. It is likely that just as the EQ-4 Global Hawk works in a similar role as a BACN platform, the RQ-180 like craft would do the same for stealth assets and their directional and low-probability of intercept data-links. , Lockheed Rendering Other forms of distributed battlefield surveillance assets include non-stealthy drones, fighters, and bombers that can in some cases use their own advanced radar and sensor systems, especially modular podded ones, to provide ground moving target indicator and other information in less contested combat environments. So there are likely some intriguing alternative solutions to the battlefield surveillance mission set, with the command and control elements being placed basically anywhere in the world, and connected via an advanced data sharing network, rather than just stuffing a ton of new gear onto a business jet. But once again, this would be relying more on networking and leading edge technologies than fielding a discreet system like a new JSTARS replacement plane. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein not only seems to have little problem with relying more heavily on networking, he actually has made it his preeminent goal to get the USAF to do so during his tenure. He has stated many times how he sees the future of the air force as information centric not platform centric, and this will be provided by advanced networking concepts. With such an outlook, you can see how a centralized JSTARS replacement may seem like a clumsy and dated step in the wrong direction for the former F-117 wing commander. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson before a Senate hearing. , AP So does dumping billions of dollars into a direct JSTARS replacement make sense? Well in a perfect world there would be money to build out both ends of the BMC2 equation, and really there would be a synergistic effect in doing so. But if that simply isn’t possible at this time, is it worth taking the risk on a distributed concept that relies very heavily on network connectivity over a more traditional centralized one? As mentioned earlier, the reality is that it won’t be just one or the other for long. If the JSTARS replacement aircraft gets fielded, it will rely increasingly on distributed assets, especially those that can penetrate into contested airspace, for providing its battlefield “picture,” at least for higher-end conflict scenarios. It is simply a fact of life that a long range business jet won’t be able to survive within an anti-access environment if it wants to bring its own sensors to bear. That doesn’t mean it can’t still provide very crucial command and control duties and even possibly provide cruise missile screening and other surveillance and communications relay functions at the same time. It may also be the ideal platform for directing those stealthy assets downrange and to task them dynamically to support a rapidly adapting battle plan. Lockheed’s J ack O’Banion, Vice President of Strategy and Customer Requirements, Advanced Development Programs (some title right?), made an incredibly slick pitch for the Global Express 6000 based JSTARS replacement aircraft during an interview with Defense News reporter Aaron Mheta. Mheta does an outstanding job asking just the right questions of the Lockheed big whig, and in the exchange O’Branion clearly says some very sensitive capabilities have been ported over from highly classified programs to their JSTARS replacement contender. Make sure to watch the video which is linked here . So what is he talking about? I mean this is a flying radar plane, not some hypersonic spy and attack aircraft . Parts of the radar system are surely sensitive in nature, as well as its secondary capabilities ( electronic warfare for instance ). But it is very possible that he is hinting at the aircraft’s battle management software, and the computer systems and networking tools that support it. That doesn’t sound too hush-hush right? But that likely isn’t the case as such software could very well have been ported over at least partially from high-end battle management software suite used to control semi-autonomous drones over a dynamic battlefield. We have talked about the genesis of such software and its capabilities in extreme detail before. We have also described how a common software platform like this can open up massive new possibilities when it comes to aerial warfare and combat in general: “Just as UCAVs can evolve over time via open architecture design and more agile construction concepts, so can their human interfaces and operating software. Strictly speaking, although new UCAV designs may change the look of the swarm, its cloud brain (command logic and artiicial intelligence) can continue to evolve linearly. Think of it as buying a new desktop computer but running the same operating system on it that is constantly upgraded. Some of the most expensive and perilous elements of building a new strike-fighter are software development and “back-end” infrastructure related. The nice thing about UCAVs is that its software and command and control elements can evolve over time and can be applied to multiple unmanned airframes used for a whole array of unique missions. These disparate unmanned systems can also have their capabilities more easily interwoven since they run on a common software and control platform. As a common software suite evolves, the system’s stability, security, and overall capabilities will only increase. This operating system that controls an autonomous swarm can be tweaked and tailored over years, or even over decades, and it can adapt to new threats, tactics and technologies as a whole without having to adapt a series of discreet control systems for separate aircraft designs. For instance, the same mission software and command and control interface could possibly be used by a large high-flying stealthy surveillance drone made by one manufacturer, while at the same time also being used for a swarm of UCAVs made by another. In doing so, these systems could work together seamlessly and flexibly even though their missions and even their manufacturers are different. One scenario may have that high-flying stealthily drone acting as a super-server and communications relay system that will enable and enhance the awareness and interoperability of a swarm of tactical UCAVs fighting below it. In another scenario, that same high-altitude unmanned aircraft may provide many UCAV swarms, say of six UCAVs each, with moving ground targets it sees on radar to attack from hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, the same software and interface system could direct low-end unmanned supply drones toward Special Forces units deep in enemy territory , with UCAVs being instantly assigned to protect them on their way. This “sandbox” like approach could give mission planners and strategists both a mission planning system and a command and control suite for a whole slew of unmanned aircraft all in one neat and ever evolving package. Think of it as a common operating system that can constantly be improved on and used by new and existing hardware alike. Not only is this concept cost effective and developmentally efficient, but it can greatly enhance the combat capability and flexibility of all the hardware it supports. For mission planning purposes and for being able to leverage the super nimble swarm mentality even further by integrating small numbers of dissimilar and specialized force multiplying unmanned aircraft into it, a common software platform and command interface will add to the lethality of the swarm as a whole exponentially.” Although we were talking about unmanned aircraft command and control and battle management here, the same software would inherently be adaptable and well suited for battle management purposes across the full spectrum of warfare, often referred to as Multi-Domain Command and Control. The software and system would likely provide seamless data fusion from a massive number of external assets, as well as the aircraft’s own onboard sensors, and present that data in a way that is easily to interpret and act upon. Intuitive filtration of data is key here, with the system being able to deliver to the operator the information they request and that is critical for their task, and no more. And once again, it could also provide direct command and control over semi-autonomous unmanned assets working down-range. Even Lockheed’s concept art hints a much wider mission set for their JSTARS recap jet than an updated replacement, with battle management software being possibly the most critical part of the entire system., Lockheed Martin An aircraft with such a potent human interface suite would truly represent the best of both worlds—being able to perform the old E-8C mission individually today, but also being able to bring not only data from but command and control of distributed assets into the picture as the technology evolves. Supposedly the USAF is still planning on making a selection on its future JSTARS replacement team by March of 2018, but that could officially change at any moment considering the fact that the Pentagon still doesn’t have a budget and the words from the department’s top executives as to the possibility of going another direction. The current E-8C fleet is scheduled to be flyable through 2023. Part of the objective of the JSTARS recap program is to drastically cut the operational and sustainment costs of the system compared to the old 707s that currently make up the JSTARS fleet. Going to a long-range business jet platform or even Boeing’s 737 derivative, will attain this goal. Also greater automation will mean far less manning requirements than what the current E-8C requires. Lockheed’s team uses the Bombardier G6000 Global Express as a JSTARS replacement platform. , Lockheed Martin The Global Express, which Lockheed’s team is proposing as a platform, is already in service with the USAF in the form of the E-11 Battlefield Airborne Connectivity Node . The Gulfstream 550 that Northrop Grumman is offering is far more prevalent in the Pentagon’s inventory, going by the designation C-37. The Navy will also be receiving a highly modified version of the type to satisfy its range control and telemetry mission under the designation NC-37B. Both the G6000 and G550 have high altitude and long-range cruising capabilities. The G550 was also selected recently for the EC-130H Compass Call replacement platform . Northrop Grumman proposes the G550 for their JSTARS replacement aircraft, claiming it will be far more cost effective and well suited size-wise than Boeing’s 737-700 derivative offering., Northrop Grumma Boeing’s 737-700 based JSTARS replacement aircraft is a larger jet and doesn’t have the high altitude capabilities of its competitors, but it also offers far more room for future growth. The 737 is the most prevalent airliner in the world and the Pentagon flies dozens of the type under the designation C-40 and P-8. Northrop Grumman says Boeing’s option will burn 50% more fuel than their G550 JSTARS aircraft. Boeing 737-700 based JSTARS platform is the largest of the bunch but it does offer more room for future capabilities. , Boeing We’ll have to wait and see if the JSTARS recap program can survive in the near term, or if the USAF will decide to invest in an interim “system of systems” solution to the BMC2 mission set. But what’s most exciting is the fact that just by the USAF even positing this alternative solution, we get another small peak of what has likely been in development, or even in operation in the classified domain. Author’s note/update: As we wrote about in a previous story , another option may be to acquire and upgrade the Royal Air Force’s relatively new Sentinel R1s, which are being retired for budgetary reasons, as an interim solution. Doing so would help buy time before executing a full JSTARS recap program. Five young airframes will help bolster the E-8C fleet as it begins to retire its oldest airframes in 2023. Such an acquisition could also be paired with the “distributed strategy” to offset risk.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman’s grand arrival in Moscow didn’t go quite as planned. As the monarch stepped off his private 747SP and onto his own air stair escalator, the gleaming white, gold, and smoked glass adorned contraption failed after moving just a few of feet. Salman, who doesn’t lift a single finger for himself, just stood there waiting for his arduous journey to the tarmac just steps below to begin again. But alas, that wasn’t the case and (GASP!), the ruler of Riyadh was stranded. It took nearly half a minute for the king to come to terms with the technical tragedy and to begin walking down the gaudy conveyor. With great courage and determination he made it safely down the roughly 11 steps to the attached reception platform below. The unique escalator system is built by TEC Huenert GmbH and really only has use for VIP clients, and likely only a very small handful at that. The system had to be transported to Russia for the King’s arrival. In other words, the stairs themselves also flew private, likely aboard a separate Saudi 747 freighter. That’s a big bill for roughly 16 steps. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_HA4lNmlcBA Keep in mind that the President of the United States, who has helicopters , a motorcade , and throngs of security and staff, much of which is transported by multiple military cargo aircraft , traveling with them, doesn’t even take along their own airstairs. And for people who have trouble making it up and down the steps, lift equipped airstairs are commonplace. The King’s personal escalator that goes everywhere with him., airport-suppliers.com I guess you know you are truly king when you get your own escalator system for getting on and off your private 747. But then again, for a guy that has his own glowing world orb that gets fondled by world leaders, why not? The unique contraption even has its own address platform that doubles as a lift. , airport-suppliers.com The king is not known for traveling light or inexpensively. Salman landed in Indonesia last Spring with 459 metric tons of luggage . That’s 1,012,095 pounds. Oh and his escalator tagged along too. In total, it took 27 flights to move all his crap and his entourage to Jakarta. Just last August the King took a holiday to Morocco, and even though The Kingdom owns a sprawling coastal retreat there, the trip still cost a whopping $100M. That makes Trump’s ridiculous multi-million dollar weekend jaunts to Mar-a-Lago look dirt cheap.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 24, 2017",The B-21’s Three Decade Old Shape Hints At New High Altitude Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Detailed information on the B-21 Raider is still scarce to say the least , but for over a year and a half we have had a rendering supposedly depicting the multi-role strategic stealth platform’s basic shape and features. Recently, other simple planform renderings have trickled out from the marketing department of the stealth bomber’s manufacturer, Northrop Grumman. Although there can be no doubt that the aircraft will feature a whole slew of cutting edge technologies, will be constructed using the latest manufacturing techniques, and will be covered in the most advanced radar absorbent coatings, the general configuration of the aircraft doesn’t seem to be new at all, in fact it appears to date back over three decades to the dawn of the stealth bomber revolution. This rendering was released on February 26th, 2016. , USAF At first glance the B-21 looks very much like the Northrop’s B-2 Spirit, and that’s for good reason. It seems that the Northrop team got the B-2’s design amazingly right over thirty years ago, and they would have gotten it even closer to the B-21’s design if the USAF hadn’t thrown the demand for low-altitude penetration capability onto the program—then called the Advanced Technology Bomber—when it was so far along in its design process. The same planform design of the B-21 was seen in this marketing banner from the Air Force Association’s annual conference in September of 2017: The call to add low-level flying capability came out of fears that Russia would field increasingly more advanced radars that would neutralize the B-2’s low observable attributes. As such, being able to sneak in below radar via flying nap of the earth flight profiles like its B-52 and B-1 brethren became a requirement for what was a high-flying strategic bomber that relied primarily on its stealthy design and careful mission planning for survival. Not only did this useless addition make the B-2 less stealthy from certain aspects and against certain radar bandwidths (most notably from behind against longer wavelengths), but it also added weight and dropped the aircraft’s altitude ceiling substantially, from roughly 60,000 feet to under 50,000 feet. The change also impacted the design’s range and most of all it added substantially to the cost and complexity of the already very high-end and expensive aircraft. So Northrop’s Advanced Technology Bomber design that would eventually become the B-2, named “Senior Ice” during its development, didn’t originally have its trademark sawtooth trailing edge, instead it had a large wedge shaped empennage just like the B-21 Raider. The sawtooth feature only came about as a result of the USAF’s aforementioned late change in requirements that demanded the ATB have low-level penetration capabilities. The original ATB configuration before the USAF’s low-level penetration requirements change. , Public Domain All this was taking place in the mid 1980s, at the height of the Reagan era defense spending boom and at a time when the Soviet Union’s war machine was still a very real threat. But just half a decade later, the production cost of the B-2, which had ballooned due in part to dwindling production numbers funded by congress as a result of the fall of Soviet Union, would cause the program to enter a procurement “death spiral,” with production ending after just 21 units were built. You can read all about the ATB program and Lockheed’s competing aircraft to Northrop in this past feature of mine . As Northrop’s original ATB design progressed, canted vertical tails, and even pivoting vertical surfaces on the aircraft’s outer wing surfaces were experimented with to provide yaw control for the flying wing design. Eventually split rudder “elevons” were chosen. Note that the B-2 retained its “V” shaped tail. The added low altitude requirement would hamper the design in multiple ways. , Northrop/Public Domain Today the B-2 remains a “silver bullet” weapon system—truly a low-density, high demand asset and an American treasure—that has proven its worth time and time again, including most recently in Libya for the second time . The tiny fleet continues to get upgrades that will allow it to remain relevant into the second half of the 21st Century. No exhausts are shown on the B-21 rendering, and it is very unlikely they are located within the jet’s trailing edge or especially below the aircraft where the jet is most vulnerable to detection by infrared search and track systems. But that’s not really that strange because the first public B-2 renderings didn’t show an exhaust system either as it was one of the aircraft’s most sensitive features and remains so till this very day (if you are shooting B-2s on a USAF base, shots from the rear remain prohibited). Early B-2 renderings omitted its planar exhaust system and the B-21 rendering also has its exhaust omitted. Notice the B-2 is shown as at a similar angle and has similar shadowing as the 2016 B-21 rendering., USAF It is abundantly clear (see above) that the USAF and Northrop Grumman looked back to the late 1980s to see how they handled early disclosure of the B-2’s design when coming up with a rendering of the B-21. Beyond telling us that Northrop got the stealth bomber design uncannily right some 30 years ago, even when computing power was just a fraction of today, the B-21’s similar design to the earlier Senior Ice derivatives tells us some really interesting things about the new bomber’s potential capabilities. The fact that the B-21’s planform is extremely similar to the High Altitude Penetrator Senior Ice concept tells us that the B-21 will be a high-flying and extremely aerodynamically efficient weapons and sensor platform, and this is very important. If Northrop’s original ATB design had a targeted operational altitude of 60,000 feet than it is very likely that the B-21 will meet the same high flying goal. This makes a lot of sense because the aircraft will be able to achieve its range goals on less fuel and thrust than otherwise, and most importantly, being able to fly up in RQ-4 Global Hawk flight envelope territory means the B-21 can put its sensor suite to work over long ranges, taking advantage of its extreme line of sight. The B-2 Spirit’s ceiling was impacted due to late requirements changes for the ATB program that gave birth to it. This won’t be the case with the B-21 Raider., USAF It also means the B-21 will be able to loiter above the tactical aircraft air combat environment below. As such it could act as a communications and data link connectivity node, sucking up information from the F-35’s, F-22’s, and one unmanned combat air vehicle’s proprietary and stealthy data links. It can then connect these aircraft below by rebroadcasting updates of a “fused” common battlefield picture on each of their individual waveforms. They could also convey the battlefield information from stealthy assets below up to satellites above where it can be pushed around the theater and beyond for real time exploitation. In essence, this will allow the B-21 to act in a similar role as a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) for stealthy assets whose sensor information will be among the most critical as these assets will be deployed the farthest forward over the battlefield. This concept, which has been cryptically touted in multiple organizational concept charts in recent years, solves a number of problems and fits in with two high priority USAF initiatives. Those include focusing on networks and information sharing, as well as morphing from a platform-centric fires and intelligence gathering strategy to a “distributed” one. Notice how a stealthy flying wing (shown as a B-2) is pictured above the stealth assets (F-35, F-22, UCAVS) acting as a communications gateway. It is likely that just as the EQ-4 Global Hawk works in a similar role as a BACN platform, a B-21 and or RQ-180 like craft would do the same for stealth assets and their directional and low-probability of intercept data-links. , Lockheed Martin It also means, like the high-flying F-22 Raptor, that many of the B-21s weapons, which will include everything from JDAMs, to Massive Ordnance Penetrators, to ultra long-range air-to-air missiles, will benefit from the Raider’s high perch. Even potentially lasers in the future will have more range due to this performance attribute. This equals farther standoff attack capability and as a result enhanced survivability, as well as increased weapons range for offensive attacks. The bottom line is that the B-21, which is really a stealth multi-role platform of sorts, not “just” a bomber in the traditional sense, will be able to be more effective across a wide range of missions by operating at higher altitudes. It also means the aircraft will cost less to construct as it will require less cumbersome structures and less powerful engines, and even reduced fuel carrying capabilities, to accomplish its mission. This is also likely a major factor in Northrop Grumman’s ability to keep the cost down even under heavy USAF scrutiny. Additionally, the use of this planform design is clearly a contributing factor as to how Northrop Grumman can claim substantial wide band low observability. Generally speaking, the larger a stealthy aircraft’s structures are, and the minimization of them all together (horizontal and vertical tails, discreet wings, nose structures and so on) the better it will be able to blend in with background radiation when even being painted by lower frequency radars. Pre LRS-B renderings from Northrop Grumman for a next generation stealth bomber show the company’s “cranked kite” planfrom being used instead of a B-2 like flying wing., Northrop Grumman This high-flying requirement is also likely a contributing factor as to why Northrop Grumman didn’t put forward their signature “cranked kite” design concept for the B-21 tender—similar to that used on the X-47B demonstrators. The company produced multiple renderings over the years of that planform being applied to their earlier Next Generation Bomber designs. But once the LRS-B program was underway this seems to have changed. We have talked multiple times about Northrop Grumman’s all but officially disclosed RQ-180 high altitude long endurance (HALE), very stealthy unmanned aircraft. This aircraft very likely influenced not only Northrop Grumman’s design but also the USAF requirements for the B-21. In the late 2000s there was a massive shift in course by the Department of Defense under Secretary Of Defense Robert Gates when it came to developing a new bomber. The B-2 remains an imposing and very futuristic looking machine. Although the B-21 will likely be lighter and smaller, it’s capabilities will eclipse the B-2’s in many ways. , USAF It is heavily implied that the RQ-180 and possibly a next generation bomber technology demonstrator proved that such a program, which had stumbled for nearly a decade, was well worth pursuing. This same aircraft, which are likely highly limited in numbers, could also serve as a companion to the B-21 in a similar manner as how the E-11 and EQ-4 BACN platforms perform the networking gateway mission, and the U-2S Dragon Lady and RQ-4B perform similar surveillance missions. We also know that the Long Range Strike Bomber requirements that followed this change specified a lighter aircraft with less payload than the B-2—also indicative of trying to reach a high-altitude capability at an affordable price. In fact, even Boeing’s renderings of their LRS-B concept featured a very similar design as the B-21 and the earlier Senior Ice configuration. The design Boeing touted as its LRS-B concept in both rendering and model form have a very similar planform as the B-21 and the High Altitude Penetrator “Senior Ice” design., Boeing With all fingers pointing to the high probability that Northrop Grumman went “back to the future” with their B-21 Raider design, we are reminded that this aircraft will be like no other in terms of its intended capabilities, with the B-2 being an inaccurate analog for direct comparison purposes. It will do much more in terms of missions than its predecessor, and will prowl the skies more deeply into the stratosphere. Maybe most exciting of all is that after 30 years of experience with the world’s first stealth bomber, Northrop Grumman’s B-21 will in many ways be the bomber that should have been, and so much more. We’ll know more when new information, or a long awaited better illustration or an actual photo is released of Northrop Grumman’s shadowy new creation. The stealth jet is rumored to be under construction now at the company’s Plant 42 facility in Palmdale, CA.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Images Emerge Of M1A2 Abrams Tank Equipped With Trophy Active Protection System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have discussed in-depth the U.S. Army’s move to equip some of its M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with a version of Israeli’s proven Trophy Active Protection System, and although we have seen some renderings of what the Abrams may look like with the system, we now have actual pictures, and they look a bit different than expected to say the least. As we noted on our last piece about Trophy, the system works as such: “Trophy… is a so-called “hard kill” active protection system for tanks and other armored vehicles. It combines a radar with launchers that shoot a burst of metal pellets, akin to a large shotgun, to destroy incoming anti-tank rockets and missiles.” Judging by these new photos, Trophy’s components are arranged in a more centralized manner than expected and the added “wing” structures attached to the Abram’s turret appears to make the tank even wider than it already is. From the front aspect it almost looks as if the brutish M1 has “ears” of sorts that protrude from its sides. One of our readers alerted us to the images, which are found in marketing materials put out by one of Trophy’s prime contractors, Leonardo. U.S. Army via Leonardo The added structure likely makes the system more modular and easy to install/uninstall and port over to other tanks if need be. It incorporates both the front and rear facing radars, the countermeasures unit and its magazine, as well as other components of the Trophy system. These images also show the M1A2 equipped with both Trophy and the new Abrams Reactive Armor Tile (ARAT) kit mounted on the tank’s flanks and skirt. It’s unclear if operating with both the new active and passive protection measures installed will be the configuration for M1s operating in the highest threat environments or not. US Army via Leonardo The brochure says the Trophy system weighs roughly 1,800lbs, but it isn’t clear if that includes the steel fairings it is installed in on the M1 or not. Regardless, it just throws another ton onto the now 69 ton plus vehicle. The system offers 360 degree protection against anti-tank missiles, RPGs, recoilless rifles and high explosive anti-tank rounds. It also offers the crew an instant indication of where the enemy fire came from so the threat can be neutralized. Specific zones cane be programmed as well. For instance, if dismounted infantry are marching alongside the left side of the vehicle, Trophy can be deactivated or put in passive detection mode on that side alone. And if an attack occurs the system can automatically broadcast the incident over data-link. If the system fails and the tank is hit, this can be very useful for getting rescue crews to it as fast as possible. You can see the entire installation, including how the rear hemisphere facing radar arrays are mounted below. This angle shows just how large the fairings are for the Trophy APS on the Abrams., Leonardo The large size of the Trophy installations on the Abrams may be why it was flagged for additional testing due to integration issues with the Abrams turret, which our own Joseph Trevithick noted just weeks ago: “Earlier in Sept. 2017, the Army Requirements Oversight Council, which works to develop overarching operational requirements and concepts, had decided that more testing was needed on Trophy. This was due to an unspecified loss of performance with regards to the turret and other impacts on the Abrams’ basic functioning.” Israel’s Merkava IV tank has a much more streamlined Trophy installation.  , Rafael Regardless of potential developmental snags, after years of delays the U.S. Army is finally charging hard to upgrade the survivability of its most potent armored combat vehicles in a move, among others , to maintain an edge against late advances in Russian tank and armored vehicle technology. It is also meant to plug key vulnerability gaps identified via evaluations of various conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, as well as emerging enemy tactics . Other active protection systems, like Iron Curtain , are also under testing and once these systems are fielded operationally they will likely end up in Eastern Europe, where the U.S. and its allies are working together to deter potential Russian aggression under Operation Atlantic Resolve.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 2, 2017",Alaskan Aggressor F-16 Emerges In Awesome New Forest Green “Splinter” Camouflage,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We were the first to report on the 18th Aggressor Squadron’s peculiar matte black painted F-16C aggressor that first appeared during exercise Red Flag Alaska last August. We found out through multiple sources, including via correspondence with Eielson Air Force Base where the 18th AGRS is based, that the sinister looking jet with an SR-71 Blackbird like motif was never meant to be. The aircraft was painted overall matte black with the idea being that it would receive the rest of its multi-tone “splinter” style paint job before taking to the flightline for aggressor duties. One source says this black base coat was applied during a visit to the depot following a major inspection and overhaul. Things didn’t work out exactly as planned and the aircraft was rushed into flying adversary support missions without its paint job being completed by the paint barn at Eielson—which is becoming notorious for its awesome aggressor schemes. The 18th AGRS is slowly having their fleet of Block 30 F-16s painted with different variations of the striking “splinter” camouflage scheme. Here is their first jet to wear a variation of the pattern: Eielson AFB’s public affairs shop stated the following in an email exchange with The War Zone that occurred in August: “The flat black paint color on the F-16 Aggressor is a basecoat in preparation for the new forest green “splinter” paint scheme. The black basecoat is the first step in preparing the aircraft for the remaining 2-week paint process.” Fast forward a couple months and the once ebony Viper has finally gotten its new look, and it’s absolutely awesome . The paint shop crew and 18th AGRS pilots check out their most wicked paint jet yet., Eielson AFB The paint job harkens back to my favorite paint scheme ever applied to a F-16, the “Viggen” inspired splinter scheme that a couple of the Navy’s short lived F-16N aggressors wore during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The green color is also reminiscent of the USAF’s still-born initiative to field close air support optimized F-16s sporting 30mm cannon pods. Painting one of these aggressor jets is not a simple nor easy task as we have talked about in detail before. According to a USAF press release about Eielson’s new splinter clad aggressors, Tech. Sgt. Augustus White, the 354th Maintenance Squadron structural maintenance repair section NCO in charge stated the following: “Typically, to fully repaint an aircraft it takes about a week to two-weeks… This process takes a lot of man-power so we run a three shift operation to get it done.” Both USAF and Navy aggressor untis have been experimenting more audaciously with various aggressor scheme in recent years, most notably since the relationship with Russia took a nose dive following the country’s invasion of Crimea. The “splinter” scheme has been worn by various Russian tactical jets over the years, including the new T-50 fighter, although it has largely been relegated to development and test aircraft. Green, brown, and black tones on the other hand are used by many potentially hostile air forces around the globe, including the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. Venezuela also flies their own F-16s in very similar tones. Venezuelan F-16B, Rob Schleiffert/wikicommons Another F-16 was supposedly also painted matte black at the same time as this specimen and will receive another “splinter” motif. So we will keep an eye out for that jet, although it will be tough for team Eielson to outdo themselves again by the looks of 86-0295. Great job to all those involved. Keep them coming!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019","Saudi THAAD Purchase Is Massive In Scope, Looking To Create Huge Missile Shield","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At nearly the same time as the news hit that Saudi Arabia would be purchasing an unknown number of S-400 air defense batteries from Russia, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency put out a release detailing The Kingdom’s big purchase of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system. And the word big is really a vast understatement. The deal has grown from roughly $13.5B the last time we reported on it in June to over $15B. It includes a whopping 44 launchers, 360 interceptors, 16 fire control and communications stations, and no less than seven AN/TPY-2 radars . Training, support, tools, facilities construction, and even 43 “Prime Mover” transporter trucks are included in the wide spanning, so called “end-to-end” weapons deal. AN/TPY-2 X-band Radar , Raytheron The Defense Security Cooperation Agency statement puts the sale in context in its own “unique” way, stating: “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country. This sale furthers U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, and supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian and other regional threats. This potential sale will substantially increase Saudi Arabia’s capability to defend itself against the growing ballistic missile threat in the region. THAAD’s exo-atmospheric, hit-to-kill capability will add an upper-tier to Saudi Arabia’s layered missile defense architecture and will support modernization of the Royal Saudi Air Defense Force (RSADF). Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.” That last statement is almost laughable, as selling what is the densest anti-ballistic missile shield in the world, minus Israel’s, certainly does alter the military balance in the region, although in a way that could favors the U.S. depending on how your view such a weapons deal. Such a large network of THAAD systems is clearly aimed at neutering Iran’s ability to rain short and medium range ballistic missiles down on Saudi Arabia during a time of conflict. It also hedges against the potential of growing advancements in ballistic missile capabilities out of Iranian-backed Houthi rebel controlled areas of Yemen . What’s interesting is that Israel has been silent in regards to this order—yet another sign of the major geopolitical metamorphosis in the region where old enemy Arab states are now becoming unlikely strategic partners with Israel—a phenomenon spurred primarily by the Iranian threat. Considering Israel’s primary nuclear deterrent in delivered by Jericho ballistic missile—with the IAF’s tactical jets still being another possible delivery platform as well as the Israeli Navy’s Dolphin class submarines for second-strike capability—the fact that the most powerful Arab state is purchasing a high-end missile shield from the U.S. would likely be very unnerving development in the past. And although those radars and missiles will be pointed east and south, they could be redeployed to face in the opposite direction. But clearly such concerns are no longer of great importance for Israel. THAAD interceptor cutaway., MDA The acquisition of seven AN/TPY-2 radars points to a Saudi goal to build a line of early warning and fire control radars that will provide overlapping coverage over the country’s vulnerable eastern and southern flanks. In comparison, a single AN/TPY-2 provides coverage for all of South Korea . With the radar placed on a golf course located deep in the southern portion of country, it furnishes detection and engagement capability for most short to intermediate range ballistic missiles emanating from North Korean territory. Part of the reason North Korea is pressing to field a submarine-launched ballistic missile capability is to be able to launch on South Korea from outside the AN/TPY-2’s coverage area. A single AN/TPY-2 and THAAD battery also protects Guam, and single radar systems are also forward deployed to Israel and Turkey . Based on similar spacing as seen in South Korea, seven radars would provide a chain of coverage starting with a radar facing north over Basra and into Northwestern Iran, followed by multiple units facing the Persian Gulf, and then picking up again to cover The Kingdom’s southern borders with Yemen, with possibly a spare radar for planned servicing and/or offering double layer coverage for Riyadh from a single threat direction. Like in South Korea, radars would be set back significantly from Saudi borders to provide overlapping coverage and to help protect the radars themselves from being destroyed during a conflict. It’s one audacious and phenomenally expensive plan. The telephone pole sized THAAD interceptor seen being fired during a test firing., MDA It is also more probable than just possible that the U.S. will benefit from the surveillance information these radars collect. And likewise, the Saudis will likely benefit from information gathered by America’s elaborate space-based infrared early warning system which can detect the launch of ballistic missiles before they climb high enough over the horizon so that radars hundreds of miles away can begin tracking them. THAAD executing a burn-off maneuever before continuing on its path toward intercepting a short-range ballistic missile, MDA This may sound like a sweet deal for the U.S., not only does it get to sell $15B worth of hardware and support to the Saudis but it also helps neuter the threat posed by Iranian ballistic missiles. But some would argue such an elaborate defensive system would make going to war with Iran a more palatable proposition, and its existence will only push Iran to build more missiles so that they can overwhelm Saudi Arabia’s defenses. The system will likely be tied with Saudi’s Patriot missile batteries, with the PAC-3 Patriot being capable of shooting down shorter-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase as well, and into the Saudi Arabia’s greater integrated air defense system (IADS) network. It’s unclear how the possible acquisition of an unknown number of S-400 air defense batteries will fit into this larger scheme as the Russian system is not compatible with the Patriot or the THAAD. Another question that is yet to be answered is if the UAE, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, which also possesses a much smaller THAAD installation, will be linked into the Saudi’s much larger system. We’ll keep you updated as the landmark missile defense deal progresses and it’s likely to become more of a major news story if hostilities with Iran drastically increase if the Trump Administration chooses not to re-certify the Iranian nuclear deal. Iran’s growing ballistic missile capabilities have been among the largest sticking points the White House has with Iran and their supposed choice not to live up to the “spirit of the agreement.” Iran just today threatened to attack U.S. bases in the region with ballistic missiles if it pulls out of the agreement.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",North Korean Hackers Stole US and South Korea “Decapitation” Plans Months Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For more than a year, North Korea has been able to pour over a massive cache of sensitive military information it stole from South Korea’s government, including plans for a so-called “ decapitation strike ” against Premier Kim Jong-un and other members of the regime in Pyongyang. This raises serious questions about the ability of the U.S. and South Korean militarities to respond in a limited fashion to North Korean provocations amid reports that the North Koreans appear to be preparing their own plans for counterattacks. On Oct. 10, 2017, media outlets in South Korea offered new details about the extent of the hacking, citing a public statement by Rhee Cheol-hee, a member of President Moon Jae-in’s Democratic Party who sits on the South Korean Parliament’s National Defense Committee. The breach of the Defense Integrated Data Center occurred in September 2016 and authorities in the South were still attempting to determine the exact contents of the stolen data. Rhee said that the hack impacted approximately 235 gigabytes of information in total. “The Ministry of National Defense has yet to find out about the content of 182 gigabytes of the total data,” he explained in his statement. The Wall Street Journal said the South Korean Ministry of Defense declined to confirm the details Rhee provided about its investigations. The U.S.  Embassy in South Korea told the newspaper that it was aware of the breach, but did not provide any additional information. North Korean soldiers with backpacks bearing the international symbol for radioactive material during a parade in 2013., Kyodo via AP But according to the Yonhap News Agency , the South Korean military already knows that the trove includes planning documents related to the war time employment of the country’s special operations forces, messages to senior American commanders, and information about military bases and critical infrastructure, such as power plants. Operations Plan 3100, or OPLAN 3100, one of South Korea’s plans on how to respond to small North Korean provocations, was reportedly in the cache of information. Most importantly, North Korean hackers were reportedly able to obtain a copy of the U.S. military’s OPLAN 5015. This is a detailed outline for what has been described as a “decapitation strike,” that would, based on available reports, seek to swiftly neutralize North Korea’s top civilian and military leadership, as well as eliminate the threat of the country’s weapons of mass destruction – including both nuclear and chemical stockpiles – and ballistic missiles. Though the exact parameters of this attack plan are classified, any such operation would undoubtedly include precision strikes by U.S. and South Korea aircraft, including missions by the low-observable B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to penetrate into North Korea’s most densely defended areas, as well as stand-off strikes by America and South Korean ships and land-based ballistic missiles . On the ground, both countries’ special operations forces would likely move in to assess the damage and secure any sensitive materials or high priority individuals. Depending on how long OPLAN 5015 envisions the overall operation lasting, additional conventional air, naval, and ground forces could conduct follow-up activities after the initial onslaught. These extra personnel would have to be prepositioned and on alert to handle any North Korean counterattacks, including commando raids and ballistic missile strikes. Though North Korea’s missile tests get the most public attention, the country does maintain a massive special operations component trained to perform what would essentially be suicide missions against critical targets during a conflict. In an actual war, North Korea would insert these elite troops using a fleet of aging, but surprisingly capable An-2 biplane transport planes , miniature submarines and other covert watercraft, and other means. Also on Oct. 10, 2017, Yonhap reported that the North Koreas had trained to assault the Combined Forces Command headquarters in Seoul, the top U.S.-South Korean command center, using paragliders , during a series of provocative exercise the month before, citing unnamed South Korean defense officials. North Korean commandos apparently conducted highly realistic drills involving an assault on a full-size model of the headquarters building. Paragliding commandos could be hard for radars and other sensors to spot and the equipment could be a cheap and effective option for infiltrating into the South given the distances involved in any such operation. Yonhap News states that elite North Korea troops could conceivably launch from the top of large mountains along the border with South Korea and then glide deep into the country. Recreational paragliders often make trips covering 100 miles or more , which is the approximate distance between the North’s Mount Kumgang National Park and Seoul. The shortest distance between South Korean capital and the demilitarized zone is less than 30 miles. But powered paragliders, often called paramotors, can launch from virtually anywhere and could conceivable penetrate deep into South Korean territory and would be tough to engage, especially if launched en masse at night. North Korean special operations forces march during a parade in 2017., Iliya Pitalev/Sputnik  via AP Given these various factors, as we at The War Zone have already noted, even a limited military operation has long been a difficult proposition for the U.S. military and its South Korean allies in general, even if the details were secret. It would be hard for the inevitable response not to escalate the situation into a broader conflict, too. Well aware of this, the United States and South Korean militaries routinely train for mass casualty scenarios, including those involving the need to decontaminate large amounts of personnel and equipment after a possible nuclear or chemical attack. Among the more than 23,000 U.S. military personnel on the Korean peninsula is a forward deployed U.S. Army chemical battalion, in position specifically to respond to such a situation among other duties. OPLAN 5015 would include many, if not all of these specifics. The U.S. military writes these plans according to a standardized format and they have to include the responsibilities of all senior commanders with a stake in the operations, the roles of their assigned forces in often granular detail, sources of intelligence for planning and operational purposes, the timelines for putting the operation into action, what reinforcements and stores of ammunition and other supplies are available, and other key details that North Korea could easily use to counter the mission. On top of that, the United States and the South Korea have a unique arrangement that means during a broad conflict with North Korea, the U.S. military is in complete control of both American and South Korean forces on the Peninsula. This issue of so-called of returning “ wartime control ” to the government in Seoul remains a major point of discussion between the two countries and they have repeatedly delays plans to do so. Though the present linkage limits South Korea’s ability to operate independently militarily from the United States, it makes it clear to the North Koreans that a war against one is a war against both. South Korean Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile launchers fire during an exercise in September 2017., South Korea Defense Ministry / Sipa via AP Images As such, it also means that the operations plans Kim’s hackers stole would likely include information about both U.S. and South Korean forces and their capabilities, no matter which country authored the plan itself. The United States is known have, or at least had in the past, nearly a half dozen more OPLANs focused on contingencies surrounding North Korea, including one, OPLAN 5029 , that reportedly outlines the response to the sudden collapse of the regime in Pyongyang for any reason. Not surprisingly, North Korea has denied any involvement in the breach. The country’s reclusive government accused their counterparts in the South of “fabricating” the claims, according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency. There are widespread reports about North Korea’s extensive cyber warfare capabilities, which experts say is the responsibility of Bureau 121 , part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, one of the country’s clandestine intelligence arms.  This unit may have been behind a breach of computers across South Korean government offices, banks and media outlets, a hack of electronics and entertainment conglomerate Sony , infecting cell phones with malware , and GPS jamming . In May 2017, South Korea’s military blamed North Korea for breaking into their networks in September 2016, though they did not disclose what, if any information, they had stolen. Nearly a year earlier, the North’s reportedly hackers lifted Korean Aerospace Industries data . relating to the F-15 Eagle fighter jet, which the company produces components for. Though hard to confirm, cyber attacks would be in line with other North Korean activities to harass opponents and bust sanctions in the face of international pressure. It only underscores the increasing importance and vulnerability of networked systems in general both during conflicts and in times of uneasy peace, giving countries an easily deniable way to try and disrupt potential opponents without touching off an actual war . Armed with information about OPLAN 5015 and any other details from this latest hack, the North Koreans also have more leverage to deter a possible attack. Since taking office in January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump has steadily ratcheted up the rhetoric against Kim and his regime, implying that there is no solution to the growing crisis except for force. “Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators,” Trump wrote in a pair of Tweets on Oct. 7, 2017. “Sorry, but only one thing will work!” We at The War Zone have continually highlighted how difficult and costly even a limited military operation against North Korea would be, both for the United States and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan. These threats have served mainly to bolster North Korea’s own propaganda machine and the Kim regime’s position that it needs nuclear weapons and other deterrents to stave off an otherwise inevitable America-led assault. Regardless, finding out the true nature of OPLAN 5015, which media outlets have widely reported on, as well as other decapitation plans, such the South Korean military’s “ Kill Chain ” concept, would have to have been a priority for North Korea’s intelligence services given the common suggestion that they include provisions for the assassination of Kim Jong-un himself. It is entirely possible that they feel they have confirmed this particular detail, explaining why they have been referring directly to the existence of such plans for some time now and even accused the United States of making an actual attempt on the leader’s life. Whatever details Bureau 121 may have uncovered will probably only serve to reinforce the regime’s paranoia and lead to additional provocations, such as more long-range missile launches or even the possibility of an end-to-end atmospheric nuclear test , all while limiting the ability of the United States and South Korea to respond militarily short of a catastrophic Peninsula-wide conflict. If North Korea has already had this information since before President Trump took office, one wonders how this has impacted his rhetoric or the U.S. military’s plans for possible military action . The U.S. military would surely have changed the OPLAN 5015 details by now. Unfortunately, it might be functionally impossible to change them dramatically enough to be sure the North Koreans would be unable to spot preparations for the attack. US Marine Corps F-35B stealth fighter jets drop bombs on South Korea’s Pilsung training range in September 2017., US Army “Yes, there are [military options], but I will not go into details,” Mattis had told reporters on Sept. 19, 2017. “Yes, I don’t want to go into that,” he added when asked if these plans involved some kind of “kinetic” action, usually a term for lethal force, such as what one would expect from a decapitation strike. However, it might have been that Mattis understood “kinetic” in this context simply to mean an active operation. In September 2017, The Washington Post reported, citing anonymous U.S. government officials, that Trump had approved a Pentagon plan to have U.S. Cyber Command conduct its own operation against Bureau 121. This may have have served the dual purpose of being a potential dry run of sorts for a future, broader cyber attack, akin to the one the United reportedly planned to launch against Iran if the Iran Deal had failed to move ahead. It definitely let North Korea know that the United States has similar capabilities and is willing to use them. Still, these new details suggest that threats of any action might be even harder to implement than we’ve previous thought, while still pushing North Korea to escalate the situation itself, ultimately leaving the United States ever less room to avoid an actual war.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2017",Modernization Funds Slashed For Russia’s Notoriously Rickety Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s sole fixed-wing aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , returned from Syria late last winter to finally begin a long and supposedly deep refit and modernization that would allow it to serve for years to come. The carrier’s overhaul, which had been put off time and time again over the last decade, is said to cost over $800M, and will take nearly half a decade to accomplish. But just as we at The War Zone had concerns about, it seems that Moscow is now significantly reducing the scope of work for the refit due to fiscal considerations, with only about half the funding needed for the original plan being provided. Interfax Russia first reported on the reduction in investment in the carrier, with their source stating: “Instead of previously planned approximately $50B rubles for the work, it is planned to allocate about half of the previously announced amount.” The reduction will surely impact the initiative to update the ship’s mission-related technology, including its radars, communications, defensive systems and so on, with the roughly $400M still allotted for the refit likely being used to repair the ship’s propulsion systems and other critical infrastructure. Russia only carrier returns home after its Mediterranean cruise., AP This triaging of resources makes sense as the Admiral Kuznetsov is famous for its poor reliably—an oceangoing tug follows it everywhere it goes—as well as its run-down living conditions and mission hardware. In particular, the ship’s boilers are known to be in especially poor condition. And although wide-eye concepts like a supposed future Russian supercarrier design have made their rounds, such projects are all but impossible for Russia to achieve, both fiscally speaking and in terms of shipbuilding capabilities. The fact that Moscow can’t even update its only existing carrier, even after years of deferring such an initiative, underlines this stark economic reality. We have talked before about how Russia’s military hardware dreams far outstrip economic truth , with multiple largely hyped programs being sidelined in recent months due to lack of funds required to realize them. Although repairing the ship’s propulsion system is a given even on a reduced budget, along with repairing other critical mechanical components, it isn’t clear how much actual modernization can be had for less than the cost of a single Littoral Combat Ship . Without major upgrades to the ship’s combat systems, its ability to fight and survive in anything but low threat, permissive environments will be put in question. On the upside, a drastically reduced scope of work could allow Russia Navy’s tiny fixed-wing carrier-capable tactical jet fleet to return to the ship sooner than originally planned. SU-33 and MiG-29KR aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov . One of each type crashed during the ship’s last cruise, and it was the first cruise for the MiG-29KR. , AP The readiness of Russian Navy fighter pilots has been questioned, especially following the loss of two aircraft, a MiG-29KR and a Su-33 , during the carrier’s last cruise where it took part in operations in Syria. With only one troublesome carrier that is just sporadically available for training, and years passing during the ship’s time in port and dry dock for maintenance , not only do shipboard flying skills atrophy but the expertise needed to teach new pilots the art of carrier aviation also dwindles. This “brain drain” is especially concerning as the Kuznetsov’s air wing won’t get to practice aboard the ship for multiple years as it receives much needed attention. Maybe the most frustrating part of all this for proponents of Russian carrier-borne naval aviation is other rising navies—China and India—have taken Russian carrier designs and modernized them into credible weapons of war , and China is now producing its own brand new carriers based on the Kuznetsov class design. But this has come at a substantial cost. China took a rusted Kuznetsov class hulk and turned it into a modernized carrier and then reverse engineered it and put the modified indigenous class into production—not a cheap affair to say the least. China has successfully built an updated Kuznetsov class carrier from scratch. , AP India bought their carrier, the INS Vikramaditya from Russia, which is a converted Kiev class aircraft carrying cruiser that was updated into a Kuznetsov class design by Russia as part of a deal that went way over budget and far beyond its intended timeline. The project cost a whopping $2.3B, which once again prompts the question of what Russia is going to get with its truncated $400M budget to update the Kuznetsov . A welcome home ceremony in the Kuznetsov’s hangar deck., AP Even a more reliable Admiral Kuznetsov has limited utility without being modernized with the systems required for it to actually go to war against a foe with a naval capability that can shoot back. With all this in mind, the question is would Russia’s Navy be far better off investing its dollars in other areas, such as in bolstering its submarine or surface combatant force? Russia’s Ministry of Defense may be in the process of answering this very question, especially after the somewhat embarrassing showing of the Kuznetsov’s air wing during last year’s cruise to the Eastern Mediterranean. Maybe this drastic reduction in funding for the vessel is a sign that further reductions could be on the horizon. If India doesn’t choose to buy more navalized MiG-29 derivatives—an aircraft it has had chronic issues with over the last seven years—for its future aircraft carrier , one of the most relevant reasons for keeping the Kuznetsov around—that being testing and marketing for export aircraft sales—may be eliminated as well. And all this comes as Russia claims that it is developing yet another carrier-borne fighter even though the “newish” jet it already has—the MiG-29KR—has only gone on a single cruise with just four airframes embarked. Maybe the Kuznetsov’s most important mission at this point is the apparent sense of pride it gives Russia just having it around. Tactically speaking, the ship and its air wing have done nothing land based assets couldn’t do. Strategically, at least in an abstract sense, it’s a different story, but keeping such a costly ship and its air wing around just to say “we have a carrier too” seems like a very poor use of limited military dollars. If Moscow decides to finally call it quits with Kuznetsov , it will probably go up on the auction block. And speculating just who would purchase the vessel and possibly its air wing is an entirely different story altogether. If the report proves accurate, we will have to wait and see exactly how the Kuznetsov’s future pans out.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 13, 2017",Check Out Scaled Composites’ New Exotic And Stealthy Test Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. So called “bleeding edge” boutique aircraft design house Scaled Composites , which is now a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, unveiled a previously unknown manned test aircraft today conservatively named Model 401. From Scaled Composites’ press release : “Scaled Composites is proud to announce the rollout and first flight of its most recent project, experimental aircraft Model 401. Scaled worked with a proprietary customer to build two vehicles to demonstrate advanced, low-cost manufacturing techniques and to provide aircraft for research flight services to industry partners and the United States government.The two vehicles were designed to be identical in outer mold line and performance, with each aircraft powered by a single Pratt & Whitney JTD-15D-5D engine with 3,045 pounds of thrust. The vehicles are capable of flying Mach 0.6 with a service ceiling of 30,000 feet and have a wingspan of 38 feet and are 38 feet long. They have an empty weight of 4,000 pounds and a maximum take-off weight of 8,000 pounds with an endurance of up to three hours.Aaron Cassebeer, Project Engineer said, “This is such an exciting time for us. Scaled is at the forefront of experimental aircraft development and I am fortunate enough to have a front row seat.” He went on to say this about the mission, “Today was a great day for our test team. We had a great flight and we are looking forward to the future test program.”This successful first flight is the beginning of the flight test phase for vehicle number 1. The Scaled team plans to continue envelope expansion on the first aircraft as they move toward first flight of the second Model 401 vehicle.” The aircraft has an extremely similar design as General Atomics’ Avenger/Predator C unmanned combat air vehicle, albeit about half the scale. So it is likely that the customer Cassebeer mentions is General Atomics, but we can’t say that with absolute certainty. Predator C/Avenger. , General Atomics The Avenger could be on the verge of a major breakthrough in international sales, with India looking at purchasing a sizable fleet of the stealthy unmanned aircraft. A less stealthy version of the Avenger is also being offered up for the Navy’s carrier-based unmanned tanker tender, which we saw our first renderings of just yesterday . Having a manned platform for surrogate testing is advantageous as unmanned aircraft realize operational efficiency in the back half of the development curve. In other words, in some cases you can more quickly test and develop technologies using manned assets than unmanned ones. It could also be that General Atomics is looking to build a smaller version of the Avenger, with a lower ceiling and less endurance, and this is manned surrogate for the program. On the other hand, the aircraft could also be used for general low observable platform testing and could replicate stealthy medium altitude, medium endurance (MAME) unmanned aircraft, with it only resembling Avenger. Other Scaled Composite aircraft have been used for similar purposes in the past, including the pint-sized Ares and the high-flying Proteus . We will keep you informed as more info on this incredible looking flying machine becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 20, 2020",What Drone Will Lockheed Use For Its High-Flying Ballistic Missile Frying Laser Demo?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last June, we talked in depth about the Missile Defense Agency’s initiative to field an “Airborne Laser 2.0” of sorts that can shoot down enemy ballistic missiles during their vulnerable boost phase. But this time, instead of massive 747 carrying a chemical laser system , this new program looks to mount a much smaller solid state laser on a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft that can fly nearly at U-2 altitudes, above 65,000 feet, and loiter for 36 hours at a time. Lockheed Martin won the latest contract that is part of this initiative to provide what is being called the Low Power Laser Demonstrator (LPLD). This system seeks to first test a low power laser system on a high-flying unmanned aircraft capable of tracking and engaging ballistic missiles during their boost phase. Integrating a high power laser system will come in a follow on phase to the overall program. YAL-1 Airborne Laser was a massive funding black hole and never achieved its aims. But now, less than a decade after its termination, solid state lasers and unmanned technology have made great leaps in capability, and the airborne laser concept is being reborn in a much smaller and more efficient package. , MDA A major part of phase one of this program will be to show how a system can fire a laser over long range without turbulence and atmospheric dispersion weakening the beam’s focused energy of its target. Using a high-altitude platform goes a long way in attenuating these issues as the atmosphere is far thinner than at the typical altitudes airliners and especially most unmanned vehicles fly at. Also, the air is smoother at high altitudes and flying above the weather means clouds and water particles aren’t likely to interfere with a boost phase engagement. Finally, the higher an aircraft flies the farther many of its sensors and terrestrial communications can reach due enhanced line of sight. Lockheed Martin Strategic and Missile Defense programs head honcho Sarah Reeves said the following about the contract and Lockheed’s LPLD concept: “Our low-power laser demonstrator concept puts advanced beam control systems and a fibre laser on a high-performance, high-altitude platform to maximize risk-reduction value over the demonstration period. Lockheed Martin has committed millions of dollars to directed energy research and development, laying the groundwork for the laser technology that brings us much closer to an operational system capable of intercepting a missile in its boost phase.” This is all fine and good, and clearly being able to fry ballistic missiles while they climb out and are still flying within their owner’s borders has become a much more pressing issue in light of recent developments in North Korea and even Iran, but one stark question remains: What platform is Lockheed intending on using for this task? Phase One of this contract is worth less than $10M and will be completed by mid Summer, so this points to an unmanned aircraft that Lockheed already has in its stable. But officially the company doesn’t have a HALE drone. So either a manned surrogate will be used, which goes against the program’s stated goals of proving an unmanned capability, or Lockheed has something readily available that it can repurpose for the demonstration. Experiments have already been carried out by the MDA with lower altitude unmanned aircraft and missile detection sensor combinations, like multi-spectral sensor toting MQ-9., MDA Adapting one of the company’s RQ-170 Sentinels , an aircraft that still operates very much in the shadows, is a possibility but by most all accounts it is not a HALE unmanned aircraft. Instead the stealthy flying wing drone is thought to operate at altitudes upwards of 50,000 feet and have an endurance of less than 16 hours. This puts it in the higher end of the mid-altitude, medium endurance (MAME) category. Still, for this first demonstration, maybe the Sentinel’s performance will be close enough to a higher-flying operational system that will be down the line. But by Lockheed executive Sarah Reeves own words, the company seems to have a true HALE system they intend to use. The RQ-170 is known to be quietly at work over potentially hostile foreign countries abroad, but it also remains in testing here at home, like this example that we were the first to report on being spotted flying out of its secondary test base at Vandenberg AFB. , Matt Hartman The only true HALE drone we know of for certain that came out of Lockheed is the Skunk Works’ P-175 Polecat technology demonstrator. This flying wing with a very stealthy shape was created in the early 2000s as an internal program aimed at rapidly bridging a perceived gap in unmanned capabilities between Lockheed and its competitors. The aircraft served as an experiment in applying the latest rapid and large structure composite manufacturing processes of the time, as well as to develop command and control interfaces for semi-autonomous drone systems, something both Boeing and Northrop Grumman were being paid to do by the Pentagon at the time. Also the aircraft’s mission, to cruise at high altitude was a major challenge in itself as that flight regime is notoriously unforgiving, and especially so for a tailless flying wing design. It also used a very low observable shape, the same one that is being used by the USAF’s next stealth bomber, the B-21, an aircraft that The War Zone discovered also likely has a very high operational ceiling. The P-175., Lockheed Martin The aircraft had a 90 foot wingspan, was powered by two FJ44 engines, and most importantly, had a designed operating altitude of 65,000 feet—exactly where the Missile Defense Agency’s capability requirements lie. Although the Polecat demonstrator crashed in December of 2006 due to an egregious operator error just as its flight testing program was developing, it seems as if Lockheed built more officially undisclosed copies, ones it has hung onto for some reason for over a decade. These have been photographed by satellites time and again at the company’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. At least two separate P-175 fuselages have been spotted over the last half decade at the company’s sprawling Palmdale Skunk Works facility, and they seem to move around the property quite a bit. As of April of last year they seem to have disappeared. It remains unknown why Lockheed kept these on hand or if they had more in indoor storage as well., Google Earth Although the supposedly short-lived Polecat is thought to have had a huge impact on the RQ-170 Sentinel program and Lockheed’s Long Range Strike Bomber contender, the aircraft could possibly be revived for the Missile Defense Agency’s testing program, especially if indeed those extra fuselages can be rehabbed and put into service at low cost. Lockheed Martin Lockheed could also have put forward an unmanned variant of the U-2S Dragon Lady, a program the Skunk Works has pushed for years now and one that would cut development time dramatically via leveraging existing and proven components. Originally this concept , which was aimed at displacing Northrop Grumman’s HALE RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, included using large parts of the U-2’s airframe, but later it was changed to primarily using its engine and reconnaissance payloads. This mostly new airframe has been dubbed the TR-X and although it would have some low observable attributes, Lockheed officials have described it as a no-nonsense “sensor truck.” But unless Lockheed secretly fielded a prototype of this aircraft, it is very unlikely they could develop it into flying form for such a short-term program as the LPLD. Rendering of the proposed TR-X, Lockheed Skunk Works Finally, it has been rumored that as the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) contract took shape, Lockheed fielded a self-funded technology demonstrator to lower risk and better compete with Northrop Grumman on the tender. Northrop Grumman is known to have a very stealthy HALE drone, the unofficially named RQ-180 , in operation, as well as possibly a next generation bomber demonstrator from the mid to late 2000s. It was rumored that Lockheed technology demonstrator aircraft leveraged an airframe that was already largely built. Whether that was a P-175 Polecat or not is unclear, but that very well could be as Northrop Grumman’s winning design used a very similar planform as did Boeing and Lockheed’s supposed entrant. In fact, the consortium’s LRS-B tender looks like a much larger P-175 Polecat, including featuring its unique intake and exhaust configuration. LRS-B concept rendering., Boeing If that is the case, Lockheed Martin could have a near perfect LPLD platform on hand, one that could even possibly exceed the MDA’s test requirements. Considering the contract is only around $10M, such a play would be to offer a highly developed solution without the development dollars needed to field one from scratch. In essence, Lockheed would be providing the host platform largely for free in an attempt to capture larger contracts to follow. Considering there aren’t many aircraft contracts up for grab these days, if the Missile Defense Agency were to field a fleet of these aircraft to keep at least one on station at all times over the Korean Peninsula and the Persian Gulf, it could end up being a very lucrative an unique long-term business opportunity. Could the P-175 rise again? , Lockheed Martin It is possible that Lockheed has something else up their sleeve that remains classified as well. The Advanced Airborne Reconnaissance System initiative, nicknamed Quartz, of the 1980s and early 1990s for instance supposedly never led to a flying aircraft, but that may not be the actual case. Although unlikely, it is possible that an airframe is left over from testing done on that project decades ago, but by most accounts the P-175 was sort of the heir to the research done on Quartz. Whatever the platform Lockheed intends to use for this program obviously it must have been part of a very attractive package as the Missile Defense Agency chose Lockheed’s proposal over multiple other highly capable defense firms which all included a proposed HALE unmanned aircraft. With a goal of fielding an operational capability by the early 2020s—an aggressive timeline to say the least—it’s downright exciting to see things move ahead at such a fast clip. And seeing that this capability could be a true game changer, especially in regards to the showdown with North Korea and our current reliance on kinetic interceptors and their complex support infrastructure, it couldn’t come fast enough.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A spate of deadly crashes has struck the international Eurofighter community. Three mishaps in the span of just one month have led to the loss of aircraft and pilots, and although the incidents seem unrelated at first glance, clearly investigators will be looking into systemic training or procedural issues that could have been factors in the crashes. Today’s loss occurred following the aircraft’s participation in a flyover for to celebrate Spain’s National Day.

The loss follows another fatal crash of a Eurofighter that occurred on September 24th, this time the jet belonged to the Italian Air Force. The aircraft failed to complete the bottom half of a loop while performing over water at the Terracina Air Show. Video of the crash was captured from multiple angles and made its rounds around the net and international TV news. Captain Gabriele Orlandi’s body was recovered from the wreckage and an investigation is ongoing into the incident, but at first glance it seems reminiscent of other near air show disasters involving Eurofighters. Still, it is unclear if Orlandi—a highly experienced fighter pilot—just entered the loop at too low an altitude—sadly a common mistake when it comes to tactical jet crashes at air shows—or if other factors were also to blame. https://youtube.com/watch?v=XboW1FyNj1s Just a matter of days before that, on September 13th, another Eurofighter crashed, this one belonging to the Royal Saudi Air Force. The jet was flying a combat mission over Yemen when it supposedly experienced technical problems and flew into a mountain. It marked the first operational loss of a Eurofighter for The Kingdom’s air arm, which has 53 of the jets in inventory of a total order of 72 airframes. RSAF EF2000., Gordon Zammit/wikicommons These tragic losses have come as the Eurofighter Consortium looks for more orders to keep its production line warm. The aircraft cost between $90M and $125M depending on who you ask, which puts it in the thick of the competition in the high-end fighter market. While France’s Dassault Rafale has stacked up the orders in recent years, the EF2000 hasn’t seen as much sales momentum. Most recently Kuwait signed up to purchase 28 EF2000s and Oman had its first example rolled out last May, it has ordered 12 of the jets in an effort to modernize its relatively small air arm. The first EF2000 for the Omani Air Force. , Eurofighter With 512 Eurofighters having been produced, and another 87 on the order books, BAE is slashing jobs associated with the program. This year 20 jets will be produced, next year just 11. Follow-on orders from Saudi Arabia and a new one from the UAE have yet to materialize. Other prospects do exist, including possible sales to Finland, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and maybe a sale in Asia, but competition for these fighter contracts is extreme and in the near term the line will struggle. Additionally, as the stealthy F-35 proliferates around the globe, the competition will become even more fierce for limited fighter dollars. EF2000s over Iceland., Italian Air Forde The EF2000 is a very capable jet, but multi-role capability came late to the type, while other fighter products prioritized multi-role abilities earlier on their development cycles. This has also hurt the Eurofighter, especially for cash strapped air arms that can only afford a single airframe—and in small numbers at that—to fulfill myriad of air combat tasks. The aircraft’s lack of a mature AESA radar has also hurt its sales, although that is changing now with the addition of the CAPTOR-E radar. This radar set has been in development for years and unlike many AESA fighter radars it isn’t static and can cover a far larger field of regard than its hard mounted competitors. Time will tell if the EF2000 can survive the changing tide of the international fighter market, but one thing is certain, the platform will continue to evolve in coming years with new capabilities and weapons being added by the Eurofighter consortium. So at least the aircraft that are already ordered will have the opportunity to reach their potential.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 11, 2017",Watch Scaled Composites’ Stealthy New Test Aircraft Takeoff For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we reported on the first photograph of legendary aircraft design house Scaled Composites’ new test platform dubbed the “Model 401.” We only had a top-down aspect shot of the aircraft that clearly sports some stealthy features, but now the company has released video of its Model 401 taking to the air and landing for the very first time. There is much speculation as to who this aircraft, and its supposed twin, were built for as their intended owner wasn’t disclosed in yesterday’s press release. As we previously noted, the jet looks very similar to General Atomics’ Predator C/Avenger unmanned air combat vehicle, and we speculated it could be a manned sub-scale demonstrator for a program associated with the Avenger. We also noted it could alternatively be a generic platform built to simulate low observable medium altitude, medium endurance unmanned aircraft and their capabilities. Similar manned surrogates that replicate the performance of known unmanned types have been used to test new systems and for training purposes. The fact that unmanned air vehicles can’t fly in much of the country’s airspace means using these manned surrogates in their place is a necessary tactic. One of our readers also noticed something that could be of importance, in an email they wrote: “Hi Tyler I enjoyed your article on the Model 401 but thought the press release wording about two vehicles being “identical in outer mold line” was hinting at something. I found that serial number 001 is registered as N401XD & 002 is registered as N401XP. “P” for piloted and “D” for drone perhaps?” Scaled Composites The theory is highly speculative but maybe there is something to it. Having one aircraft be manned and a near identical copy be unmanned, with a fairing replacing the canopy and covering the cockpit, and avionics and a satellite communications systems taking the cockpit’s place, would allow for manned and unmanned tests of equipment on a common platform. Once again, such a concept would also allow for these tests to occur over areas that currently do not allow unpiloted aircraft operations. This would not only be advantageous for getting new systems fielded faster but it would also provide a control variable for testing manned versus unmanned capabilities against each other. We have reached out to Scaled Composites for more information and photos, we’ll let you know when we find out more about this awesome aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","It’s Official, Canada Pens Formal Letter Of Interest For Surplus Aussie F/A-18 Hornets","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the strangest sagas in defense procurement over the last decade has been Canada’s meandering road to a new fighter aircraft to replace, or even augment , the country’s relatively small fleet of aging CF-18 Hornets. We have talked in great depth about this issue, and although the Super Hornet is clearly the right jet for Canada, a recent trade spat has made it politically unsavory for the Trudeau Administration to order even a handful of the strike fighters as a interim measure before selecting a fighter to replace the entire CF-18 fleet sometime in the future. In the meantime, Ottawa quickly pivoted to looking for possible second-hand Hornet options to help bolster their current fleet of roughly 75 CF-18s. After seemingly leaving no stone unturned, Australia’s F/A-18A/B Hornet fleet, which is nearly as old, seems to be where Canada has the best shot at attaining extra airframes without having to wait too long or go through Boeing to obtain them. From most accounts, Australia has kept its F/A-18A/B fleet in remarkable fighting condition. These jets served as the country’s only fighter for many years, and have seen action in conflict zones half way around the globe—most recently flying missions against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But with a burgeoning Super Hornet fleet and F-35s on the way, the Aussies can probably spare some of their legacy Hornets in the near term. Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Considering Canada seems to have few other options, and has now officially presented Australia with a letter of interest in acquiring some of its surplus Hornets, Ottawa isn’t exactly in the best position to negotiate on price. In fact they are in a pretty damn lousy one. Time has run out on kicking the proverbial can down the road, and their current Hornet fleet needs help now if it is to survive well into the next decade. Simply put, beggars can’t be choosers, and since the Trudeau Administration is willing to embargo the purchase of new Super Hornets from Boeing, Australia may be the only show in town short of acquiring an entirely different type. Snapping up Eurofighter Typhoons or leasing Saab JAS-39 Gripens may seem like a good idea, but the cost of introducing another fighter type into the RCAF arsenal is a nonstarter considering the force’s frugal budget, and especially considering yet another new type could be introduced less than a decade later after a final replacement fighter is selected. Training, support, logistical channels, tactics development, even basing requirements differ drastically from fighter to fighter and from manufacturer to manufacturer, so procuring another distinct fighter type as an interim solution isn’t going to happen unless there is no other choice. In the end, Canada would be better off paying top dollar for a couple dozen Aussie CF-18s than going down such a route. The RAAF bought 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim measure to fill the gap between F-35 IOC and the retirement of the F-111 Pig, a once controversial move that has proven wildly successful. So much so in fact that Australia also purchased 12 EA-18 Growlers to provide high-end electronic attack capabilities for their air arm, and half of the F/A-18F fleet are also wired for conversion to Growler capability in the future, which will help make the F-35A more survivable in dense counter-air environments., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Australia originally ordered 57 F/A-18As and 18 F/A-18Bs, for a total of 75 airframes, in 1981. The vast majority of the jets were assembled in Australia. 71 are still flying today, which is pretty amazing in itself and a testament to the maintainers and pilots who worked with the fleet over the years. Australia’s Hornets are also close to the same block and age as Canada’s jets and have received similar upgrades throughout the years. The plan is for the Australian Hornet fleet to be divested as a near equal number of F-35As—72 at this time but that number could grow—come online. The process that should be completed by 2023 with initial operating capability (IOC) slated for 2020. The first two Australian F-35As fly alongside an RAAF CF-18A, the same aircraft the Joint Strike Fighters are intended to replace., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence It will be interesting to see what type of deal terms Australia replies to Canada with for their used Hornets. The force could likely afford to lose a dozen of the jets in the very near term, and then more as F-35 deliveries continue and IOC approaches, although RAAF will still have to mitigate its risk to some degree in regards to the F-35 timeline. But after the F-35A’s IOC is achieved in 2020, the Australian legacy Hornet fleet will likely dwindle rapidly. Bombed up RAAF F/A-18A ready to take on ISIS. Australia’s Hornets have received upgrades over the years that are very similar to those introduced by the Royal Canadian Air Force., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Who knows, maybe Australia will reply with an “all or nothing” proposition, in which the buyer has to take the whole fleet or none. Either way, if Canada receives dozens of ex-RAAF F/A-18s they should be able to spread flying hours around a larger fleet and have plenty of spares to lessen operating costs and increase aircraft availability rates. This, paired with further upgrades and a service life extension program on some of their existing aircraft, could push out the need for a replacement fighter purchase into the latter half of the 2020s, if not the early 2030s.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",U.S. Navy Shows Off Might In South Korea As North Threatens Guam Once Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the most powerful vessels in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal are descending on South Korea for port visits before executing large scale naval drills with the Republic of South Korea Navy. This includes the arrival of the Ohio class nuclear guided missile submarine USS Michigan today and the Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Tucson just days ago. The supercarrier USS Ronald Reagan will arrive at the port of Busan next week along with her escorts. Unsurprisingly, North Korea is very unhappy about the naval buildup and has once again threatened a missile launch towards Guam before the drills commence. North Korea’s threat to demonstrate a nuclear capable ballistic barrage near the U.S. territory of Guam is nothing new. This summer, as rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea hit a crescendo, Pyongyang made the same threat, but after Kim Jong Un reviewed the plan, he supposedly decided to “wait and see” how events progress before executing the provocative launch. None of this means Pyongyang won’t execute such a plan now, especially as the relationship between the two countries has entered uncharted territory following North Korea’s hydrogen bomb test in early September and the exchange of top-level diplomatic unpleasantries at this year’s U.N. General Assembly. The high profile port visits aren’t just a matter of R&R and cultural outreach for the ships’ crews, far from it in fact. Just like the now constant bomber flights over and near the Korean Peninsula, they are meant to be major shows of force aimed at North Korean consumption. A similar display, minus the nuclear fast attack submarine, occurred earlier this year with the supercarrier USS Carl Vinson and USS Michigan calling on Busan last Spring as the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea began its steeper descent. Next week’s naval drills will supposedly feature a large counter special operations element , with activities occurring in both the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. North Korea’s special operations units are tasked with infiltrating deep into South Korean territory in the opening hours of a conflict, where they will take down high value individuals, attack command and control targets and bases, as well as wreak havoc on infrastructure and the general populous. Insertion methods include low altitude night intrusions by throngs of AN-2 biplanes , tunnels that run under the DMZ, and even paragliders would be used to cross over the DMZ. USS Ronald Reagan made a port visit to Hong Kong before heading towards South Korea. , AP But North Korea’s most menacing and perhaps its forces’ most trained for insertion method of all is via small boat, midget submarine, or by diesel electric submarine which will allow commandos to get close enough to the coast at night to wade ashore. With this in mind, training to detect and engage these threats before they land on the beach is probably a very high priority these days for the Republic of South Korea Navy and the U.S. Navy. Besides its 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, which would rain down on targets in North Korea during the opening moments of a conflict , the Michigan is specially equipped to carryout clandestine special operations missions, and was seen with two dry dock shelters attached to its spine when it pulled into Busan. The Tucson can also support smaller detachments of Navy SEALs. The 7th Fleet has integrated special operations units more aggressively into its carrier strike groups in recent years as well, and SEALs and MARSOC detachments work from the flattops and their escorts, in this case the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Stethem (DDG 63) and USS Mustin (DDG 89). USS Ohio , one of four of the converted SSBNs that are now Tomahawk missile arsenal ships and special operations platforms is seen with a SEAL Delivery Vehicle outside its dry dock shelter.  , KIM JAE-HWAN/AFP/Getty Images With the big naval drills looming, we’ll see if North Korea lashes out, and hopefully it won’t be via another nuclear detonation. North Korea’s Punggye-ri test site seems to have become very unstable since the last blast, leading to major concerns over a potential release of radiation. If it is unusable, it could be an additional reason why North Korea has threatened a mid-ocean nuclear test recently. There have been reports that multiple North Korean missiles have been seen being moved to launch sites as of this evening, and that very well could be, but it seems like we get these reports virtually every weekend now. Although rumors persist of back channel negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea, it could be that Kim Jong Un has decided another escalation is needed. That escalation would likely be a downrange multiple IRBM test, likely targeting waters off Guam as promised, or the test of another ICBM. In other news, Donald Trump thinks America’s rickety missile shield is almost perfectly effective, telling Sean Hannity on Wednesday: “We have missiles that can knock out a missile in the air 97 percent of the time, and if you send two of them, it’s going to get knocked down.” This of course isn’t accurate . As we have discussed in detail , America’s so called missile shield is far from a perfect antidote to ICBM attacks. Many variables go into a successful intercept, and the real world is different than controlled test conditions, especially if multiple missiles are launched at one time. The fact that the President thinks completely otherwise may be unnerving to some as it invites more aggressive and risky policy decisions toward the so called Hermit Kingdom. We’ll keep an eye on the region over the weekend and will report if something major occurs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 4, 2018",The CH-53’s Dark Present But Bright Future On This The Chopper’s 53rd Birthday,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The massive Sikorsky CH-53 turns 53 today. It’s pretty amazing to think that the “Stallion” took its first flight on October 14th, 1964 and the type is now entering its third major iteration in the form of the immensely powerful CH-53K King Stallion. As they say, the only thing that can replace a CH-53 is a better CH-53! This is something Israel seems to have recently learned in a very hands-on fashion. First flight of the YCH-53A on October 14th, 1964., Sikorsky Archives Our friends at Flightglobal.com report that the Israeli Air Force has halted its evaluation of the MV-22 Osprey—which was supposed to be prelude to an initial order of a half dozen of the tilt-rotor transports to begin replacing the IAF’s aging CH-53Ds, stating: “The Israeli air force has frozen its evaluation of the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, with a senior defense source indicating that the tilt-rotor is unable to perform some missions currently conducted using its Sikorsky CH-53 transport helicopters.” This is a testament to the half century old Sikorsky design, and although MV-22 is a remarkable aircraft for certain missions, such as combat search and rescue and long-range infiltration, even the twin-engined Sea Stallions, commonly referred to as “Deltas,” remain superior in other respects. Roughly two dozen CH-53Ds serve with the Israeli Defense Forces in the critical long-range/high capacity vertical lift role, with a special focus on nighttime and special operations missions. Around 2010 they were upgraded to Yasur 2025 configuration allowing them to serve reliably into the next decade. , Oren Rozen/wikicommons The last decade hasn’t been so kind for the Pentagon’s triple-engined H-53E variants. To put it frankly, the fleet has been ridden hard and put away wet. Neglect on a systemic level first hit the relatively small MH-53E Sea Dragon minesweeping community, with deadly crashes resulting in major operational changes. Not long after scrutiny fell upon the Navy’s Sea Dragon fleet we learned that the CH-53E community that the USMC depends so dearly on for heavy vertical lift support was also in shambles. I detailed how miserable of a state the CH-53E fleet and its community were in February of 2016, writing in part: “The confidential independent study ordered by the Marine Corps found a litany of issues, including the fact that force size has dropped to just 146 Super Stallions—50 less than what is needed. If the U.S. were to go to war, even in a limited fashion, nearly every airframe would have to deploy. This leaves nothing for stateside training, contingency operations or war reserve. Making matters worse, major parts shortages and years of deferred maintenance plague the fleet. Most astonishingly, this has led to a readiness of just 23 percent. This is less than one third of the Pentagon’s general readiness target of 75 percent for its military aircraft. With a readiness rate of just 23 percent and just 146 CH-53Es in inventory, only 33 aircraft are actually available at any given time.” The CH-53E fleet has been “sand blasted” over the last 16 years of perpetual warfare in the Middle East. , USMC At the time, CH-53E pilots returning from combat deployments were getting only 30 flight hours over six months. Spare parts availability was dismal and the Marines had all but forgotten to invest in the critical capabilities the Super Stallions provide, instead prioritizing buying $65M Ospreys and $125M F-35Bs instead: “The CH-53E fleet has been at war for the last decade and a half. The Army realized just how brutal a toll prolonged fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan took on its air assets that they budgeted $1.2 million for “resetting” each of its helicopters when they returned from combat overseas. The Marines, on the other hand, budgeted less than a tenth of this amount, setting aside just $100,000 per helicopter to get them refreshed. Now the Marines are paying for this stinginess and lack of foresight in an embarrassing and crushing way when it comes to combat readiness… The way the Marines aim to fix the problem is to spend about half of the $650 million set aside this year (roughly equivalent to two and a quarter F-35Bs or five MV-22 Ospreys) to reset the Marines ailing air arm on resetting the CH-53E fleet. The goal is to get the entire Super Stallion fleet back in order and its crews back to mission ready status by 2019. Additionally, two H-53Es that were in storage are being brought back to life by Erickson Incorporated and will be inserted into the fleet in the coming months.” Making things worse, the loss of two Super Stallions during a night training mission near Oahu on January 22nd 2016 turned up some appalling realities of squadron life in a CH-53E unit, including the lack of training many of its aviators were receiving. Low aircraft availability was clearly a contributing factor to the tragedy. Since all this came to light, NAVAIR’s three year effort to reset the CH-53E fleet, during which 16 airframes are undergoing a deep overhaul at any given time, and other investments in training and spare parts has garnered major improvements in readiness for the CH-53E fleet. But just last week a CH-53E caught fire while flying over Okinawa, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The helicopter was totally destroyed and the incident has since been classified as a Class A mishap ($2M in damage or loss of life/permanent disability), leading to a 96 hour stand-down of Super Stallion operations out of Okinawa. All that’s left of the CH-53E that landed while on fire in Okinawa on October 12th, 2017., AP The incident is under investigation but it is yet another reminder of the fact that the CH-53E force, including rehabbed airframes, is aging rapidly. Although the helicopter still features incredible maneuverability as well as high-speed, heavy lifting, and high-hovering capabilities, those can only be put to use when the aircraft is actually in mission ready condition. But thankfully there is a replacement on the horizon—one far more mighty than even the Super Stallion it will replace. CH-53K King Stallion during testing., USMC Enter the CH-53K King Stallion. I have profiled Sikorsky’s next iteration of the H-53 in the past, and to suffice it to say, it is one exciting although terribly expensive flying machine . But the capabilities it provides are absolutely essential to the USMC’s mission. With a combined 22,500hp surging through its three turbines—roughly 50 percent more power than its predecessor—the aircraft’s top speed will near 200kts and it will have a maximum gross takeoff weight of a whopping 85,000lbs. It also sports 15 percent more internal volume and a host of other improvements, many of which are aimed at making the aircraft far more reliable and less maintenance intensive than the notoriously finicky Super Stallion. It will also be much more adaptable to future technologies. The King Stallion had seen its fair share of delays, but it is now deep in testing with four test and development aircraft being put through their paces. Just last August the Navy awarded Sikorsky a $304M contract for the first two CH-53K destined for active service. The aircraft will be delivered in 2020, at which time production will hit 24 airframes per year and the CH-53E can finally begin being retired. German CH-53G deploying infantry during a NATO training exercise. , AP The CH-53K is also attracting interest from overseas air arms which could result in sales beyond the 200 the USMC plans on purchasing. Israel very well may end up procuring it instead or even in addition to MV-22s, especially in light of the recent news mentioned at the start of this article. Germany is also interested in the type to replace their CH-53G s—which are upgraded versions of the CH-53D. Japan, which has flown a version of the MH-53E Sea Dragon could also be a future customer. Other air forces, many of which fly the H-47 Chinook, could also be potential purchasers of the King Stallion once it matures into an operational state. Regardless of its most recent woes, the CH-53 remains an amazing helicopter that has taken part in some of the most well known military air operations in modern history— both good and bad . With the King Stallion on the way it is likely the type’s legacy will continue for many decades to come, with the possibility of one day celebrating the Stallion’s  75th, or even 100th birthday a real possibility.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 17, 2017",Israel Strikes Back: Fighters Destroy Syrian SAM Site That Fired On Recon Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports state that an Israeli aircraft was on a “routine reconnaissance mission” over Lebanon when a Syrian SA-5 “Gammon” surface-to-air missile site fired on the aircraft from across the Lebanese-Syrian border. The missile didn’t hit its mark and the SA-5 site was subsequently destroyed by IAF aircraft. Israel has made it clear that it will do whatever necessary to protect their aircrews, but also said it had no intention of further escalating the situation. Benjamin Netanyahu stated the following after the incident: “Today they attempted to hit our planes… If anyone attempts to harm us, we will harm them back.” Unsurprisingly, the government of Bashar al Assad in Syria had a different take on the incident, claiming their SA-5 (also referred to as the S-200) missile struck the Israeli Air Force aircraft and that Israel’s reprisal attack only did “minor damage” to their SAM site. They also warned of “dangerous consequences” for such acts in the future, which is not surprising because they have also threatened to rain Scud missiles down on Israeli ports and other facilities if Israeli airstrikes within their country continue. We have reported on Israel’s steady stream of airstrikes in Syria, which have largely been targeted at shipments of advanced weaponry to Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters. At first the incursions into Syrian airspace were not officially talked about by Israeli Defense Forces officials or by Israel’s political leadership, but over the years the strikes have become more freely disclosed . The head of the Israeli Air Force talked about them candidly shortly after entering into retirement this summer, stating “we prevented going to war” in a must read interview. This isn’t the first time a Syrian SA-5 took a pot shot at an IAF aircraft. Last March an SA-5 was shot towards Israeli fighters exfiltrating from Syrian airspace following an air strike on a weapons transfer site. The missile was engaged by an Israeli Arrow anti-ballistic missile interceptor. We detailed the encounter here . What followed was an increasingly bellicose string of rhetoric between the Assad regime and the Israeli government, with Israeli Defense Forces making it clear that they would dismantle Syria’s air defense network “without thinking twice.” It turns out that the same SA-5 site that fired on IAF fighters last March was the one that attacked the Israeli aircraft today, and was subsequently destroyed. The SA-5 is a massive missile, with more in common with ballistic missiles than modern SAMs of today. Here an Iranian unit readies a SA-5 for launch. , AFP/Getty Images It isn’t exactly clear where the offending SA-5 battery was located, although most reports state that it was housed roughly 30 miles east of the Syrian capital of Damascus. This would put it 50 miles from the Syria-Lebanon border, which is well within the potential range of the Soviet-era long-range SA-5. Considering most reports state the IAF jets attacked the site with four bombs, the fighters likely ventured deep into Syrian airspace to execute the retaliatory strike, if not coming within very close range of the SAM site itself. It is unclear what type of aircraft was fired upon when it was on a reconnaissance mission over Lebanon, but everything from high-flying Gulfstream jets to F-15Cs with large reconnaissance pods are known to be active intelligence collectors. Even the IAF’s high-end fighters’ basic electronic warfare and electronic support measures suites are capable of gathering critical intel on the enemy’s electronic order of battle, with the country’s new F-35Is being especially well suited for such a task. Regardless of the type of aircraft doing the snooping, it was most certainly not alone. The IAF would have sent it with a package of fighters prepared to respond to exactly this kind of scenario, as well as other potential contingencies. Reports state that Israel warned Russia of its reprisal before executing the attack, but that could have occurred in a matter of minutes, meaning the same fighters already in the air could have struck the SA-5 site “on the fly.” The tit-for-tat incident came just a matter of hours before Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s Defense Minister and vacation buddy of Vladimir Putin , was due to arrive in Tel Aviv for meetings with Avigor Liberman, Israel’s defense minister. Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told reporters that Shoigu will “get a full briefing on the matter.” The development is especially troublesome as it has been known that Russia and Syria have merged their air defense networks , and in doing so, the Syrians could benefit from Russia’s more advanced aerial surveillance technology—a capability that could have been leveraged for long-range targeting of the SA-5 missile. Also, there is always a possibility that a Russian technician or advisor could be at a Syrian SAM site when it is attacked. Israel giving Russia early warning of the impending attack likely led to the site being totally evacuated by all personnel, including Syrian operators. We will have to wait and see if anything big comes out of the high level meetings between the Israeli and Russian Ministers of Defense, but one thing is certain—Israel is not willing to curtail its sorties in and around Syrian airspace, but the fact that they have struck an air defense site belonging to Russia’s closest ally in the region may change the nature and risk of future missions, as well as put stress on Russian-Israeli relations. Oh and as a side note, today is supposedly “air defense” day in Syria . Whether this could have factored into the cross-border shot taken at the Israeli surveillance aircraft remains unclear.

This seemed to be primarily another hate-fueled response as part of ever heightening rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea, but its roots may have been in a real technological and logistical roadblock Pyongyang’s nuclear program is now facing. As we have mentioned recently , North Korea’s mountainous Punggye-ri nuclear test site has experienced a series of smaller but significant earthquakes in recent weeks that geologists believe are indicative of the huge caverns created by nuclear detonations falling in on themselves. Satellite imagery has also show large deformations and landslides in the area. This has led to fears of a major radiation release from the site that could endanger people living in the region, including most notably those living on the Korean Peninsula and across the country’s northern border, in nearby China. PUNGGYE-RI NUCLEAR TEST SITE, NORTH KOREA – JANUARY 6th, 2016: DigitalGlobe Satellite Imagery of North Korea’s Punngye Nuclear test Site. This image was taken shortly after the underground Nuclear Test on January 6th, 2016. , DigitalGlobe/Getty Images It is thought that another nuclear test at the site could be “suicidal” for the regime, not just due to the instability of geological formations in the test area, but also due to weakening deeper down along key fault lines that traverse the area. There are even concerns that further underground nuclear detonations, especially ones as powerful as North Korea’s September 3rd thermonuclear weapon test , which had an estimated yield of some 140kt, could result in a catastrophic eruption of North Korea’s sacred Mount Paektu. Mount Paektu’s Heaven Lake during the winter is truly a out of this world type setting. , Farm/wikicommons Over 1,000 years ago Mount Paektu had a massive eruption, “something like 1,000,000 nuclear weapons all going off at the same time in terms of energy involved… It’s hard really to imagine the scale” according Clive Oppenheimer , professor of vulcanology at Cambridge University. Oppenheimer was allowed to inspect the mountain during a rare visit to the Hermit Kingdom, and even though its three mile wide crater, known locally as “Heaven Lake,” might look placid, the volcano below is showing signs of activity once again. Heaven Lake during the summer. , Bdpmax/Wikicommons All this is very concerning, and it should be especially so for North Korea itself. In essence, they have destroyed their own test ground, in part due to their own success. The test on September 3rd of a much more powerful weapon, roughly eight to ten times more powerful than anything they had tested before, clearly accelerated the failing integrity of the test site. Even a radiation leak from Punggye-ri caused by past tests could be a major geopolitical blunder for North Korea, as China, which is already cooling its relationship with Pyongyang to some degree, would likely be forced to make even larger moves to isolate the regime if its own people were affected by its nuclear weapons development program. With all this in mind, North Korea may have no other choice but to move to atmospheric testing if it decides it must continue to make large leaps with its nuclear program in the near term. It is possible another test site may be identified, but preparing it for testing, including coring out the long tunnels for such activities, would take time. Testing a nuclear weapon somewhere in the Pacific would also serve as a massive escalation, which may be a wanted or unwanted result by the regime depending on who you ask. The last atmospheric nuclear test was by China in 1980, and setting such a precedent once again wouldn’t be good news for the international community to say the least. Additionally, the fallout could be a major issue as well, as the jetstream picks up the radioactive particles and blows them westward. Kune Yull Suh, professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, stated recently: “It’s likely that North Korea will conduct its next nuclear test in the stratosphere, or about 100 to 300 kilometers (60 to 185 miles) from the ground, where it will be able to conduct more powerful detonations.” A high altitude test could also have major impact on electronics on nearby islands and vessels due to the weapon’s electromagnetic pulse. Many theories exist on just how much impact a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) would have on modern technology. Some say it would destroy nearly every unhardened electronic device across huge swathes of territory, basically setting man back to a pre-electricity age in an instant. Others say that a HEMP would have less consistent effects, with the power grid and its long power lines being most vulnerable. What we do know is that during the 1962 high altitude atmospheric nuclear test over Johnston Atoll dubbed “Starfish Prime,” electrical systems in Hawaii, some 900 miles away, were adversely affected, with many components being totally destroyed. Keep in mind this was a time before integrated circuits—which are most vulnerable to the fast E1 component of an EMP, were in virtually all electronic devices. Also, one third of the satellites in orbit at that time were also destroyed due the weapon’s secondary effects, with more failing months after due to malfunctioning electronic components. Fast forward to today, and America’s top general in charge of the country’s sprawling nuclear arsenal sees HEMP attacks as a very real threat . But even he doesn’t seem to know exactly how bad the results of such a strike would be. Of course yield of the weapon and its optimization for an EMP attack matter, as does its height at detonation. North Korea recently made threats relating to an EMP attack. In fact, shortly before testing their thermonuclear warhead they said it was intended to be used as an EMP device. So they are very familiar with the asymmetric impact such an attack can have on its enemies—all of which rely on intricate electronics far more than they do. As such, testing a weapon high in the atmosphere would give the North Koreans better insight into exactly how EMP’s work and what effects they have on modern electronics and electrical systems. The big question is how would they execute such a test? There are some misconceptions in the media about this. Most assume they would fire a missile from their own shores into the pacific, where the warhead would detonate somewhere along its flight path. This is may be the most probable method, but they could also sail a cargo vessel into the area and launch a short-range ballistic missile on a high parabolic trajectory and have the weapon detonate downwind from the vessel at a relatively safe distance. It is unclear what the U.S. and its partners would do to stop such a test if it couldn’t be hidden from the watchful eye of their maritime patrol assets. If detected, would the ship be raided or even sunk? Theoretically, such a test could even be accomplished by North Korea’s lone Sinpo class submarine which can carry a single KN-11 “Polaris” submarine-launched, medium-range ballistic missile. Past test launches have used submersible barges or the submarine at fairly close distances from shore. Sortieing far out in the pacific is likely beyond North Korea’s capabilities now, but that could rapidly change after a number of additional successful KN-11 launches are executed. A KN-11 missile is lowered into the launch tube in North Korea’s only Sinpo class submarine., KCNA With just a single hydrogen bomb test under their belts, it seems that North Korea needs more tests to perfect their device, but the country could also just focus on their long-range missile programs for the time being. This could be at least a tacit sign that the regime sees these weapons more about deterrence and as possible bargaining chips than anything else. If they push for another test in the near term, whether at their crumbling test site or risk potential backlash and even kinetic reprisal from an atmospheric test over the Pacific, it would indicate otherwise. Seeing how fast things have moved when it comes to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and how steep the nose-dive in the already dismal relations between the U.S., its allies, and North Korea has become, we will probably find out their plan far sooner than we would like.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 16, 2017",The F-35 Rumor Mill Is Spinning After Israeli Counter Strike On Syrian SAM Site,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A day after Israel’s counter attack on a Syrian SA-5 surface-to-air missile site we are learning more about the incident, and unfortunately, some questionable outlets and commentators are spreading rumors that imply one of Israel’s F-35Is was the aircraft targeted by Syrian missiliers, and that the aircraft was damaged in the attack. It appears that the first sortie put “more than one” aircraft “within the effective range” of the Syrian SA-5 missile that fired at the flight according to an Israeli Defense Forces spokesman. The engagement supposedly occurred at around 9AM local time. It remains unclear the exact mix of Israeli aircraft that were in the air at that time. Some reports state it was a flight of F-16s, others tell us it was a composite flight including an F-15C executing photo reconnaissance duties while operating closer to the border than its escorts. As mentioned in our first article on the incident, the F-15C is known to carry large tactical reconnaissance pods for the IAF. Loaded up F-16I Soufa (Storm)., IAF A follow-up sortie was launched by Israel roughly two hours after Syria fired at its jets, with this one is confirmed as being made up of F-16s. These aircraft prosecuted the attack on the offending SA-5 site east of Damascus. Four air-to-ground weapons, described officially as bombs, which can mean quite a few things considering the IAF’s unique weapons inventory , were delivered on the SAM site. The attack was centered on the site’s fire control radar/emitter and was not a wide area barrage on the SA-5 missiles arrayed around it. The emitter was destroyed or damaged to the point it was no longer operational according to IAF bomb damage assessments. As we noted previously, Israel maintains that all its aircraft returned to base unscathed, while Syria claims they scored a hit on one of the fighters during the initial SAM attack. The Assad government usually claims false victories anytime something like this occurs. But some have taken an unrelated report about an F-35I, one of just seven in Israel’s inventory at this time, being damaged by a bird strike as some sort of coverup for an F-35I being successfully targeted and hit by the Syrian SA-5 while over Lebanon. In other words, under this theory the reconnaissance aircraft was an F-35I. IAF Although we can’t rule out the possibility that an F-35I was operating over foreign territory, it is unlikely. In fact, we have been down this same road before . Israel has not achieved initial operations capability (IOC) with its F-35 fleet as of yet, so sending it into harm’s way on an operational sortie seems like a very odd and reckless choice. Even though the Israelis have rushed fighters into service in the past for unique operational needs, the F-35I is an especially delicate procurement topic for the Israeli government. Israel’s lawmakers have publicly noted the high cost of the aircraft and have stated that they will “meticulously assess” the need for more F-35 purchases past the first 50 ordered. So risking the new jets before they are actually operational on a seemingly standard mission would be an odd if not reckless move by the IAF. Also, even though the F-35 does have high-end electronic intelligence gathering capabilities, it doesn’t have traditional tactical image intelligence gathering capabilities. So sending it on such a mission, if that was indeed the mission’s objective, makes little sense. F-35I Adir., IAF Even assuming the F-35I was the aircraft targeted over Lebanon, the chances of it being hit by an SA-5 are very slim, and the bird strike now being reported by the IAF supposedly occurred two weeks ago with the aircraft being grounded since awaiting a Lockheed team’s inspection and subsequent advice on how to best repair it. ""A bird hit it"" – Israel Is Hiding That Its State-Of-Art F-35 Warplane Was Hit By #Syria 's S-200 Missile – Reports https://t.co/nl5WD6pDXO — Sharmine Narwani (@snarwani) October 17, 2017 You are probably asking yourself how there is any chance a stealthy F-35 could be targeted by Syrian SAM site in the first place? It is known that Russia and Syria have now integrated their air defense systems together, so data sharing by some of Russia’s more advanced sensors could make spotting a stealthy aircraft easier. Also, the F-35, which is optimized for hiding from higher frequency radar systems, like prevalent X-band fire control radars, could possibly be spotted by operators using lower frequency tactics and systems. But even if the F-35I was detected, that still doesn’t mean it could be reliably tracked and engaged. The aircraft also has an advanced electronic warfare suite to repel such attacks. Considering the information at hand, conspiracy theory-like reports of an F-35I taking damage from a Syrian SA-5 seem to be a lame attempt at attacking the F-35’s capabilities, American made air combat technology, and the IAF’s claims of air superiority in the region. And although we cannot rule the possibility out entirely, as Freud would say—sometimes a bird strike is just a bird strike.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last sixteen years of perpetual warfare in the Middle East one thing has become sickeningly obvious—even a heavily armored combat vehicle can be a very deadly place for soldiers. The scourge of roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan changed the way America fights ground wars forever. Going from zooming around in lightly armored or even unarmored Humvees to rumbling around the battlefield in heavily armored Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs) occurred in just the span of half a decade. Even if an armored vehicle saves the life of a solider from dying in the IED detonation, that soldier still has to get out of the mangled up-armored Humvee or MRAP that could be laying on its side, or worse, upside down. And it doesn’t take a bomb to make a armored vehicle deadly. Rollovers and accidents have caused many deaths unrelated to direct combat over the last decade and a half of the Global War On Terror. MRAPs in particular, with their V hulls and high centers of gravity are especially prone to rolling. The upside down universe inside one of the Army’s MRAP egress trainers., US Army When any of these events occur, soldiers find themselves still in the familiar confines of their vehicle, but at the same time totally disoriented and even under fire from the enemy. Enter the rollover/emergency egress simulator. These unique devices track their lineage back to the “helo dunkers” used to simulate a crash landing of a helicopter in water. In the civilian world, rollover simulators have been around for decades , with police agencies finding them especially useful for training purposes. But these were largely much cruder apparatuses than the high-tech ones the military has been fielding over the last decade. U.S. Airmen practice exiting a mine-resistant, ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle after a simulated rollover during egress training at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., May 13, 2013. Strobe lights, loud speakers and fog simulators were used in addition to the MRAP egress trainer to simulate combat conditions. , US Army Their job is to give soldiers insight into what to expect if they find themselves strapped in their vehicle after it comes to rest at an unusual attitude, and even how to escape with their weapons, being ready to defend themselves from whatever is going down outside. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ChMgcgDZyTY https://youtube.com/watch?v=NT9rrCixE3k Although this type of training can look like fun to some, the inside of a armored vehicle is not forgiving to flailing limbs—we are talking about an armored steel can on wheels here, so soft touch surfaces are all but non existent. As a result, these drills will leave their share of bumps and bruises, but they are intended to save lives in the real world when it matters most. And a real roll over, or even worse a roadside bomb or mine explosion, would result in a far harsher ride than what these trainers put their occupants through. Add in smoke, dirt, fire, screams, and even bodily trauma, and you can see why a little muscle memory for a stunned soldier that just had one of their greatest fears come true can go a long, long way.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 29, 2017",Just Remember North Korea Can Destroy Low Earth Orbit For Everyone On A Whim,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Low earth orbit (LEO), which is a band of space measuring from roughly 100 miles to 1,200 miles above the earth, has become one part packed parking lot and one part junkyard within just 60 years of mankind having access to space. Everything from communications satellites to spy satellites to the International Space Station call low earth orbit home. Simply put, the vast majority of all satellites are stationed there and many of them are critical to our very way of life. This makes the reality that North Korea could destroy accessibility to this vital medium without warning very disturbing. The amount of debris in LEO is already a major problem. Just a tiny piece of space junk traveling at thousands of miles per hour can cause catastrophic damage to operational satellites and even the International Space Station. With over 500,000 trackable pieces of space junk (generally larger than a marble in size) and millions of smaller ones whizzing around the planet, the problem has become a major one, but it could get much, much worse. Case in point, an anti-satellite weapons test executed by China in 2007 that used a defunct Chinese weather satellite as a target. The satellite was stationed in a polar orbit at 537 miles altitude. A kinetic kill vehicle launched by a modified DF-21 medium-range ballistic missile smashed into the satellite at a combined closure rate of five miles a second. Over 3,500 pieces of trackable space debris were caused by the test—the biggest single release of orbital space debris in history. It is estimated that over 150,000 smaller particles were also released after the kill vehicle shattered the satellite, many of which will remain in orbit for centuries to come. Debris plot by NASA. A computer-generated image of objects (usually a golfball size or larger) in Earth orbit that are currently being tracked. Approximately 95% of the objects in this illustration are orbital debris, i.e., not functional satellites. The dots represent the current location of each item. The orbital debris dots are scaled according to the image size of the graphic to optimize their visibility and are not scaled to Earth. The image provides a good visualization of where the greatest orbital debris populations exist. This image is generated from a distant oblique vantage point to provide a good view of the object population in the geosynchronous region (around 35,785 km altitude). Note the larger population of objects over the northern hemisphere is due mostly to Russian objects in high-inclination, high-eccentricity orbits., NASA The test was a major wakeup call on multiple tactical, strategic, and geopolitical levels, and made the growing issue of space junk a much more familiar topic in the public’s consciousness. With America’s military might ever more reliant on space-based capabilities, anti-satellite weaponry has since become a shadowy and fast-moving weapons development space. Considering major peer state adversaries like Russia and China also rely on space for key military and commerce capabilities, anti-satellite weapons are morphing into much more dynamic and less invasive concepts than the kinetic kill vehicles of the past that pulverize their targets. These new concepts include mini “satlets” capable of manipulating and sabotaging other satellites in orbit— and various countermeasures that work to provide a mission kill on orbiting sensor and communications platforms without smashing them apart up or even touching them at all. These include blinding lasers, electronic jamming, and other forms of temporary operational disruption. Just because potential high-end foes of the US and the US itself are developing softer, kinder, anti-satellite capabilities, with an unspoken mutually assured destruction strategy of sorts making kinetic kill anti-satellite weapons undesirable, it doesn’t mean other countries that don’t have a large stake in space are following suit. Quite the opposite in fact, they have made note of a potential highly asymmetric weapons capability—one that they most likely already have in their arsenal. Kim Jong Un inspects an HS-14 ICBM before launch., KCNA A rogue state, namely North Korea, who has to find ways to neutralize American, South Korean, and Japanese technological superiority any way they can, know full well that they can deny easy access to LEO and destroy many strategic satellites in the process by leveraging their existing ballistic missile technology. We are not talking about developing a hit-to-kill anti-satellite weapon that rides atop a ballistic missile here. Instead the goal would be to detonate a number of ballistic missiles at varying orbital altitudes and latitudes, with their payload being thousands of ballbearings or other shrapnel items. Instead of being fired on long down-range lofted trajectories, they would be launched at steeper parabolic flight profiles—similar to how North Korea tests its missiles today. With a handful of missiles launched into popular orbital pathways and detonated could result in much of the current utility that space offers being destroyed. What’s most worrisome is that this application doesn’t require complex reentry vehicles or ground targeting and navigation capabilities like a long-range ballistic missile-bound nuclear warhead does. Instead it turns a ballistic missile into the ultimate anti-access/area denial weapon—that area being the closest vicinity of orbital space. Even the use of a single missile optimized for this dastardly mission could result in horrific consequences. The Kessler Syndrome , where a single orbital debris event could cause a cascading or “domino” effect, was widely introduced to the public by the 2013 blockbuster “Gravity” starring Sandra Bullock. Because there is so much space junk already in orbit, basically 95% of what’s up there is not used for operational purposes, once a new debris cloud is introduced could snowball as it circles the earth, causing a whole maelstrom of new debris, all with their own unique trajectories. If multiple new debris clouds are introduced, this phenomenon could be exponentially accelerated. Deploying a satellite under the guise of science is another way one of these events can be triggered. Objects in orbit move at very high speeds, so launching a satellite with the sole purpose of impacting another orbital object, such as an abandoned satellite or even a defunct space station , is another way a massive debris cloud could be intentionally formed. Just yesterday North Korea announced its interests in deploying another satellite like it did aboard one of its Unha rockets in early 2016 and in 2012. It is widely understood that these satellites have little operational value to the North Koreas. Fears of their payload being used for nefarious purposes have been prevalent, including some postulating they could be some sort of electromagnetic pulse weapon —something that is more possible today than it was years ago considering how far North Korea’s nuclear program has come over just the last year. But using such a cover to execute a space anti-access mission, where North Korea’s satellite impacts object in LEO, is much more feasible. Still, just firing off ballistic missiles during a time of extreme tension or war would be the most likely way a rogue state like North Korea would attempt to blind and deafen its technologically superior foes. What’s most concerning is that we have no way of intercepting launches of this type, where steep flight profiles make mid-course interceptors useless, and terminal interceptors irrelevant. Boost phase intercept capabilities are in development , being based almost entirely on directed energy weaponry (lasers) and unmanned aircraft, but it will be at least half a decade before they are operational, and that is a highly optimistic timeline to begin with. The fact that North Korea has made massive strides in ballistic missile technology over the last year makes all this much more concerning. Their Hwasong-14 (HS-14) ICBM reached a peak altitude of 2,300 miles during its last test in late July . That is nearly ten times the height of the International Space Station’s orbit. With height being sacrificed for payload and flight profile, HS-14 missiles could put massive amounts of debris in orbit throughout the LEO envelope. The Hwasong-12 (HS-12), which North Korea seems focused on developing as its primary intermediate range ballistic missile to threaten the Pacific region, has proven that it can fly as high as 1300 miles, just beyond the LEO envelope. These missiles are among North Korea’s most proven and menacing weapons, and are likely easier to produce and far more numerous than the larger and longer-range HS-14. Even Pyongyang’s solid fuel KN-15 reached a height of 310 miles during tests, this puts it in the thick of LEO, and that missile can be launched with little warning due to its solid-fuel configuration. The intermediate range HS-12, which is an evolved version of the BM-25 Musudan missile , has become North Korea’s most potent and well tested ballistic missiles. , KCNA The idea of Kim Jong Un taking away critical space access potentially for generations, and with just a missile or two that he already has in his arsenal is terrifying, but for American and allied military commanders it is an immediate threat to their ability to wage war that has no countermeasure at this time. And there is no doubt that our individual lives would be changed immediately by such an act as we rely so heavily on satellites in LEO for everything from communications to weather forecasting. The chances of North Korea carrying out such a devastating asymmetric attack would become increasingly more likely as a conflict approaches or gets underway and it should be factored into the cost-benefit analysis of everyone in a strategic decision making position from the Commander in Chief on down the line. Beyond the military reasoning for launching such an attack, by most indications the Kim regime would follow a “scorched earth” mentality if an attempt is made at removing it from power, and taking low earth orbit away from humanity could be part of such a plan. If anything else the reality that a single man with some rockets could potentially destroy, or at least greatly harm, such a critical resource for all of mankind should serve as yet another reminder of why we need to invest in a solution to the space junk problem as a whole. Some potential solutions, or at least partial ones, are beginning to emerge. These include using small “cubesats” with thrusters to de-orbit large pieces of space junk—which is likely similar to the latest anti-satellite military technology rumored to be in development—to building de-orbiting systems into satellites before they are launched. Even orbital tethers are being eyed for the seemingly insurmountable task of cleaning up LEO. But even in the decades to come, should a large scale orbital cleanup be executed using any number of concepts, a handful of missile aimed at intentionally cluttering LEO can potentially create the problem over again, at least to some degree. As such, being able to shoot down all types of ballistic missiles during their ascent stage, before they can climb to orbital heights, remains the best antidote for such a threat—that and trying to stop the proliferation of medium-range and more complex ballistic missiles in the first place.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020","The First Giant Mecha Robot Fight Was Lame, But This Real Cold War Era Mecha Wasn’t","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It had a slim chance of ever living up to the hype. The long awaited duel between manned robots from America’s Mega Bots Inc. and Japan’s Suidobashi Heavy Industries ended up being more of a grandiose mechanical tickling match than a “Jaeger” fight to the death. Seeing that the entire program was largely Kickstarter funded, the let down wasn’t really any great surprise, and maybe we will see a more dynamic battle sometime in the future if the proto-sport of sorts survives. But your craving for a real life version of Robot Jox doesn’t need to emanate entirely from a fictional place. During the atomic age of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Pentagon built its own massive manned robot of sorts, and its job was far more dangerous than crunching steel with another of its kind. The real-world giant mecha emerged from the nuclear powered aircraft program that began shortly after the end of World War II. The idea seems insane today, but back then putting a nuclear reactor on an aircraft seemed like a logical step in the right direction for the new technology. The program morphed into a nuclear powered bomber program and moved its way through different offices over a decade until it was eventually cancelled—thankfully—in 1961. But during its development it became clear that human beings, even ones wearing heavy protective garments, were ill suited for servicing such a vehicle and its radioactive fuel. Crash recovery and cleanup was also a major issue to contend with. Enter General Electric’s Nuclear Materials and Propulsion Operation, General Mills, and Jared Industries and their innovative giant robot the “Beetle.” Life Beetle, which was designed and constructed from 1958 to 1961 at a cost of $1,500,000 for the Air Force Special Weapons Center, was just about as opposite a vehicle as the popular VW Beetle of the era as one could imagine. Built on the tracked chassis of an M42 Duster self-propelled 40mm anti-aircraft gun system, the contraption tipped the scales at a whopping 77 tons. Powered by a 500hp supercharged Continental engine, it had a top speed of just eight miles per hour, and measured 19 feet long by 12 feet wide. https://youtube.com/watch?v=c_yQOPZ5CY0 The Beetle’s cube-like cockpit section was mounted on four huge hydraulic pistons, allowing it to rise 27 feet in the air—a necessary feature for working on what would have been a massive nuclear powered bomber. Its interior was shielded by steel armor and a foot of lead plating, and the operator’s viewport was made of multi-layered leaded glass that combined measured two feet thick, allowing the Beetle and its occupant to roll right into highly radioactive environments and perform relatively delicate tasks. The shielding cut down radioactive exposure by a factor of 3,000. An operator could work an entire day inside the vehicle in an environment that would otherwise kill him in just ten minutes. Life/USAF Once the operator made their way inside, the seven and a half ton hatch was lowered slowly over them, itself operated by four big hydraulic pistons. It also had a battery operated backup pump system that could open the hatch, and a mechanical hand crank on the inside and the outside of the cockpit just in case both other systems failed. There was no other way to escape the tight confines of the Beetle than out of its overhead hatch, so if all else failed an eight hour supply of oxygen bought the operator some time. The interior of the Beetle was claustrophobia inducing, but it did feature an ash tray, lighter, a very comfortable seat, and a small TV set, among other creature comforts, although the TV was used for monitoring a closed circuit camera system, not for watching I love Lucy . The camera system viewed what was behind the Beetle, like a backup camera today, and a unit could also be attached to one of the Beetle’s arms for seeing close up and around corners. It seems that the idea was getting the hatch opened and closed took so long that making the interior as comfortable a place as possible meant entire shifts could be covered without having to leave the Beetle’s cockpit. But still, there was no room to stretch out walk around. A General Mills patent shows the early vision of a the Beetle concept. Later the company worked at creating the Beetle’s complex manipulator arms., US Patent There was a two-way radio system installed for talking to people outside of the contraption, and even a mic and speaker system was installed so that the operator can hear the engine as they execute maneuvers. A three ton nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) warfare rated air conditioner kept the occupant cool even when the temperature climbs to Death Valley heights outside. Swing out binoculars were setup in the cockpit so that the operator could quickly read the inscriptions on his tools and gauges over a dozen feet away at the ends of the Beetle’s arms. A periscope also provides a top-down outside view for enhanced situational awareness. Photo shows subscale mockup of a Beetle-like vehicle tending to a B-36 derived nuclear bomber., USAF Its powerful hydraulic arms, which were designed based on the configuration of a human’s arms, had over 85,000 pounds of force, enabling them to rip apart metal fuselages or bash over concrete walls, while at the same time the fine motor control was so well tuned that an operator could pick an egg out of a package, hold it in a spoon, and then put it back in the package. A high-profile media event displayed this capability for all to see in 1962. The ends of the arms could be reconfigured with a number of tools on the fly, allowing the crab-like contraption to work as a multi-function handyman. Its fingers had sockets for different tools to be inserted. The nuclear powered bomber’s components would have also been designed with the limitations of the Beetle in mind. Life Although the Beetle was clearly impressive, it was also still very much an experimental design and suffered from constant mechanical issues and breakdowns during initial testing. Its hydraulic system was troublesome—something you simply can’t deal with when handling nuclear materials around an aircraft’s fuselage. Its electrical system, with over 400 miles of wiring, had constant issues. Many of these problems were fixed as testing went on, but other larger issues would have been something the USAF would have been willing to throw money at fixing if the nuclear bomber program hadn’t been cancelled in 1961. This left the completed Beetle without a clear mission and without a good case for additional follow-on funding. Life By 1962 it was reassigned as an experimental nuclear accident cleanup device, but considering it needed to operate on flat paved surfaces, its applications were limited. This combined with its astronomical maintenance needs meant the end for the Beetle program. General Mills’ work on Beetle helped them in creating the manipulator arms for the record setting DSV Alvin submersible , which was first deployed in 1964. And in retrospect, the Beetle concept was a precursor to the robots we have today that are used for all types of dangerous missions, albeit without a human being inside them. These are namely bomb disposal robots, which are now even used to kill hostile perpetrators , are prevalent in police forces throughout the US and on the battlefield. Similar robots have been used to go where people can’t, including in highly radioactive environments, such as in the battered Fukushima power plant in Japan. Of course we also use unmanned robots that can manipulate their environment to explore the depths of our oceans and other planets, and unmanned ground combat vehicles are finally becoming a growing sector of the weapons industry. But still, one has to wonder what a more refined Beetle 2.0 would have looked like and been capable of. Supposedly designs for a smaller, more nimble machine were already in the works when the program was cancelled. It almost seems like entire nuclear power plants could have been designed around a family of vehicles like this, allowing for accessibility to radioactive areas and systems even after things have gone horribly wrong. But alas, it was never meant to be. But knowing of the obscure Beetle, including its genesis and capabilities, does make you look a little differently at the somewhat corny “fighting mechas” built some 55 years after the Beetle first rolled around the tarmac. Now if we can just get this competition DoD funded right?

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers, and their tricked-out helicopters are notoriously shy, operating primarily at night. But the famed unit and their specially modified MH-60M Black Hawks took part in the Marine Corps’ Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course capstone exercise in Arizona earlier this month. During the drills the Night Stalkers flew an aerial refueling mission at sunset, suckling gas from a KC-130J tanker, and the conditions couldn’t have been better for some dramatic and downright beautiful video of the operation. Weapons and Tactics Instructor courses are held at MCAS Yuma roughly every other quarter and aim to produce the best pilots in the world that have proven a mastery of combat aviation, tactics application, and battle planning. The marathon-like class lasts seven weeks, with its end culminating in a Large Force Employment (LFE) exercise planned and executed by the students. These capstone drills integrate some of the latest technologies in the Pentagon’s quiver and can include guest units taking part in different elements of the grand operation. As WTI graduate Major Brett McGregor of course 2-14 puts it : “In order to capitalize on all the capabilities that [Marine Corps aviation] has, you have to bring everyone together in one location and plan and execute together… As a student, it is not a test to see how good they are at flying their aircraft, it’s a test to see how well you can fight with the MAGTF as a whole; how well you can fit into the team and be effective from the bigger picture.” Over the years WTI has grown to become one of the top air combat training events in the country, and is largely a more flexible and varying event than Red Flag and other well established large-scale training events. In some ways it is similar to the USAF’s Weapons School final training exercises, but it also integrates ground force elements of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), which is the cornerstone of Marine Corps aviation. In the latest iteration of WTI, which was executed at the start of October, the 160th SOAR and their Black Hawks were players. This resulted in the outstanding video below. The incredibly clarity and slow motion gives us a fairly unique view of these aircraft that seem to be more comfortable operating in the shadows than in the light.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 24, 2018",India Might Finally Terminate Their Stealth Fighter Program With Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report by Defense News states that India is extremely unhappy with Russia’s supposed 5th generation fighter—better known as the T-50, or by its new production name the Su-57—that will act as the base for the sputtering FGFA cooperative fighter program between the two countries. The news comes after years of squabbling over the program, usually characterized by credible reports of the Indian Air Force’s dismay with the qualities of the Russian aircraft. Now it seems as if the Indians want out of the program—which aimed for at least a 108 airframe production run—once and for all. Such a move could also be a result of New Delhi’s changing geopolitical and military affiliations, in particular its deepening strategic relationship with the United States. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) project between Sukhoi and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is a decade old. It originally aimed to create a variant of Russia’s new stealth fighter with a number of alterations specified by India. These include potential enhancements to reach certain low observable (stealth) requirements, as well as particular avionics, communications systems, and weapons integration. A two seat version was also envisioned. The whole idea behind the concept being that the FGFA would leverage a fairly mature Russian next generation fighter design, and build upon it. The problem is that the design in question, the Su-57, doesn’t appear to have the “bones” needed to modify it to meet India’s expectations. A proposed lineage of the T-50, but it is unclear if the aircraft will ever be built in large numbers, yet alone so many variants. (Note: the Su-57 is shows as Su-50 in this earlier chart), Sukhoi The T-50/Su-57’s degree of low observability has always been in question. It is one of the most hotly debated topics on military aviation forums and I have described how the design balances some stealthy attributes against other features and weaponry, as well as cost and production capabilities. But time and time again India seems to have been doubtful that the base aircraft design could meet their FGFA requirements. This notorious photo alone has been the subject of hot debate as to the T-50’s radar signature, especially where it matters most, head on. A jet’s fan face produces a massive radar signature. Modern high-performance stealthy aircraft designs use “S” shaped ducts to hide their engines from most or all line of sight aspects, with radar return scrambling baffles being built under the duct surface scrambling returns even more. Some aircraft, like the Super Hornet, use a slotted baffle that covers the fan faces of their engine, which are hidden only partially by the aircraft’s duct shape. This measure reduces the aircraft’s frontal radar signature, but it is less effective than an s shaped duct and may impact certain aspects of engine performance. Many other features on the T-50 also put a high level of low observability in doubt. , Public Domain There have been promises by Russia that the T-50 prototype will evolve into a more stealthy design, but now it seems with it entering production as the Su-57, those enhancements haven’t emerged. The Defense News report states: “Senior IAF leadership recently expressed apprehension to the Ministry of Defense, claiming the proposed FGFA program with Russia does not meet desired requirements like U.S. F-35 fighter type capabilities, disclosed a senior IAF official. That official added, that “IAF is not keen to continue with the program.” The proposed FGFA program does not meet desired stealth and cross section features compared to a F-35 fighter, the official explained, thus major structural changes are needed that cannot be met in the existing Russian prototypes.” The level of stealthiness that can be applied to the Su-57 design likely matters substantially more now than it did nearly a decade ago. Pakistan had been India’s primary national security focus, but in recent years the rise of China’s military might and their extra-territorial aims have shifted New Delhi’s defensive priorities. T-50 prototype seen during a test flight., Aktug Ates/wikicommons China’s air force in particular has become massively more potent since the FGFA initiative began, with their own impressive stealth fighter— the J-20 —now officially operational , not to mention a Chinese medium stealth fighter is also likely on the way . This is on top of upgraded models of existing designs, such as the AESA radar carrying J-10B, and procurement of multiple Flanker derivatives including Russia’s own somersaulting Su-35 . Simply put, India sees that it needs a stealthily fighter to maintain some sort of parity with its potential foe, and for use as a force multiplier to enable its less capable fighter jets via creative tactics. If the FGFA can only deliver limited low observability, with it only being considered “stealthy” in very narrow frequency bands and only from certain aspects, the goals of the expensive initiative won’t be met. Photo by Sergei BobylevTASS via Getty Images Another major issue mentioned in the report is the aircraft’s lack of a “modular engine concept.” According to Indian officials this makes maintenance and serviceability highly troublesome and will make surge operations hard to accomplish as much of the work can’t be done by the Indians themselves. Russian powerplants are known to have comparatively low time between overhaul (TBO) intervals. Once it reaches this interval, usually the engine has to be shipped to a depot for total refurbishment, which often times is in Russia. For instance, the AL-31 thrust vectoring engines that power the Indian’s SU-30MKIs had a TBO of just 1,000 hours . A modular design could allow for different engine components to be swapped quickly, making sidelining entire powerplants due to issues or overhauls less of a factor. Indian Air Force Su-30MKI., Alan Wilson/Wikicommons In recent years, Russia claims its engines have made great strides in durability, with large increases in TBO time and reliability, and one of Defense News’s sources seems to make the case that the production engine for the FGFA will be better in multiple ways than the AL-41F engines currently flying on the Su-57: “Vaijinder K Thakur, retired IAF squadron leader and defense analyst disagreement with the Air Force assessment of capability, saying that the current Russian FGFA prototype, known as Su-57, features the AL-41F1 engine. But the production variant of FGFA would be fitted with the Product 30 engine which is 30 percent lighter, features improved thrust, and has better fuel efficiency and fewer moving parts. That results in improved reliability and 30 percent lower life-cycle cost.” Betting on future Su-57 engine developments aside, India has decades of experience of dealing with the Russia’s jet engine industry as a whole, as the Indian Air Force is still flying everything from the MiG-21 to the MiG-29K till this very day. The MiG-29K in particular, which is the country’s only carrier-capable fixed wing fighter, has had major readiness and quality control issues, as we detailed in a past article : “India’s MiG-29K force (read all about the type’s decades long development here ) remains controversial as the aircraft is reported to be ill suited for persistent use under harsh carrier conditions, with ongoing major engine , flight controls, and airframe issues. The type has a miserable availability rate, with India Today reporting: “Serviceability of the warplanes was low, ranging from 15.93 per cent to 37.63 per cent and that of MiG-29KUB ranging from 21.30 per cent to 47.14 per cent. Serviceability refers to the total number aircraft available for operation at a time from the overall capacity… the service life of the aircraft is 6000 hours or 25 years (whichever is earlier) and with issues facing the MiG-29K/KUB, the operational life of the aircraft already delivered would be reduced.”” MiG-29K, USN Even arguably its most modern and capable Russian fighter, the Su-30MKI, has been plagued with engine problems and other issues with failing components that have caused major deficits in aircraft availability. Even after a corrective spare parts deal was initiated the Su-30’s woes have continued . If India remains concerned not just with the powerplants themselves, but with their concept of construction and servicing, the attributes Thakur touts above for a future AL-41 derivative won’t solve the problem. The War Zone has discussed the T-50/Su-57’s woes before, along with Russia’s inability to fund major purchases of the jet now that it is entering production, stating : “Despite initial plans to have built 150 of Sukhoi’s T-50 stealth fighter by 2020, the Kremlin has now scaled that back to a buy of just a dozen aircraft . This year, after more than seven years of flight testing, the Russian military hopes to finally take delivery of the 10th and 11th pre-production prototypes.  The program has been beset by delays, accidents , and rumors of massive design changes, along with very public criticism from India , which has become an increasingly frustrated partner in the endeavor.” Russia’s two most advanced fighters, the 4th generation Su-35S and the 5th generation T-50/Su-57., AP Moscow has cut other high profile programs entirely , and is in the process of truncating others . But with Russia not ponying up for substantial block buys of Su-57s, India could face much more expensive unit costs for its modified version of the fighter. Small fleets of any airplane type are prohibitively expensive to sustain, but when it comes to high-end fighters, the costs can be crushing. Additionally, since India already faces supportability issues with its other late-model Russian-built fighters, an even more advanced and complex one that Russia isn’t even buying in quantity could result in a similar but even more acute set off issues with the FGFA. HAL is supposed to receive large industrial offsets as part of the FGFA program, but full technology exchange is unlikely. As such, the Indian Air Force will still have to rely on Russia for production and servicing various components of the aircraft. T-50 seen carrying large external fuel tanks and its digitized paint scheme during testing. , Russian MoD A final turn away from the FGFA program and from treating Russia as a preeminent tactical aircraft supplier may have been accelerated by the cozying up in relations between the U.S. and India. On October 18th, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson praised the US-Indian relationship, stating : “President Trump and [Indian] Prime Minister Modi are committed, more than any of our leaders before them, to building an ambitious partnership that benefits not only our two great democracies, but other sovereign nations working toward greater peace and stability.” Tillerson went on to describe how both India and China have risen in power on the world stage, but China has done so less responsibly: “…China has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order, even as countries like India operate within a framework that protects other nations’ sovereignty… China’s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for. The United States seeks constructive relations with China… But we will not shrink from China’s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.” With an emboldened China seemingly pushing India and the U.S. closer together than ever before, with both being dependent on tightening military cooperation to deter China’s expansionist actions in the region, the prospects for new advanced arms deals between Washington and New Delhi are improving. Currently the Block 70 F-16 is in the final running for a major Indian Air Force single engine fighter contract. Meanwhile, Super Hornet is becoming a front runner in an emerging competition for the Indian Navy’s next fighter— one that will fly from catapult equipped supercarriers as well as the ski jump equipped carrier it has now, with another currently under construction. The U.S. Navy is also actively helping the Indian Navy design its next generation aircraft carriers. But the faltering FGFA program could give the U.S. and India an opportunity to make what would be the ultimate game-changing fighter deal—equipping the Indian Air Force with the F-35A. Lockheed Martin The Trump Administration could look to consummate its new, closer strategic relationship with India by offering up the Joint Strike Fighter for purchase. Having India join the JSF community could also offer certain synergies for other F-35 operators located in the eastern hemisphere, both on a strategic and a sustainment level. Indian F-35s would also work to counter-balance China’s military might arrayed along the increasingly tense Indian-Chinese border . It could also mean that the F-35 could also become a competitor for the Indian Navy’s next fighter initiative, with the B model likely being offered for the ski jump carriers and the C model being an option for the future catapult equipped ships. A loaded out F-35B test firing an ASRAAM., Lockheed Martin India probably wouldn’t receive a large degree of technology transfer under such a deal as export controls on the F-35 are notoriously tight even for NATO operators. But it is likely that some industrial offsets could be offered, including the possibility of depot work and some component construction being done in-country. It is unlikely that such a deal would be offered until after the single engine jet fighter competition is decided, but India could see the writing on the wall, and cancel the FGFA in hopes of joining the Joint Strike Fighter family in the near future. Above all else, the export of the F-35 to the India—a jet that requires unique, costly, and extensive infrastructure to sustain—would be very bad news for Russia’s tactical jet industry. But given the flourishing relationship between the US and India, and the growing threat posed by China in the region, it may just be a matter of time till F-35s fly with Indian Air Force roundels of their wings.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",F-35As Headed To Asia For First Operational Deployment Amid North Korean Tensions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first operational deployment of the USAF’s F-35As will begin next month according to Pacific Command . A dozen of the stealth fighters and 300 airmen from the 34th Fighter Squadron based at Hill AFB in Utah will deploy to America’s sprawling Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. The assignment will last six months with the jets first arriving in early November. The 34th Fighter Squadron’s F-35As will join the USMC F-35Bs operating at MCAS Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, that have been forward based there since last January . The F-35Bs have been active in the region, including flying armed escort flights with B-1B Bombers on “show of force” missions over and near the Korean Peninsula. The USAF’s F-35As, with their enhanced range and larger internal bomb carrying capability, will likely play heavily into operations over the tense region as the U.S. and its allies and North Korea inch closer to war. The F-35A has already visited Korea. Just last week two of Hill AFB’s jets arrived in South Korea for the Seoul International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition (ADEX). The mini deployment served two purposes. The first was to show off the fighter to Republic of Korea (ROK) forces who will also be flying the type in the not so distant future. South Korea has ordered 40 F-35As at a cost of roughly $6.5B. The jets will begin arriving sometime in 2018 and follow-on orders are possible, although South Korea is looking to land an agreement with the U.S. to use some of the F-35’s technologies for their own stealthy indigenous fighter program dubbed the Korean Fighter Experiment (KFX). F-35A in Seoul for ADEX 2017, a truly international affair. , USAF The visit also served as an experimental training mission for maintainers and support personnel who will have to be able to fix and operate six times the number of jets for far longer a period of time during the F-35A’s upcoming inaugural operational deployment. And keeping jets flying has been a challenge for the F-35 community on multiple levels beyond the fact that it is a very complicated aircraft that has a skin that must be kept in near perfect condition to be mission ready in most circumstances. It now seems as if spare parts—or the lack thereof I should say—is causing additional woes on the F-35 fleet. Bloomberg reports : “The Pentagon is accelerating production of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 jet even though the planes already delivered are facing “significantly longer repair times” than planned because maintenance facilities are six years behind schedule, according to a draft audit. The time to repair a part has averaged 172 days — “twice the program’s objective” — the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog agency, found. The shortages are “degrading readiness” because the fighter jets “were unable to fly about 22 percent of the time” from January through August for lack of needed parts… …Already, the agency said in the draft obtained by Bloomberg News, the Defense Department “must stretch its resources to meet the needs of continued system development and production while at the same time sustain the more than 250 aircraft it has already fielded. Upkeep of the F-35 fleet will become more challenging as the Pentagon prepares for what the manager of the program has called a “tsunami” of new production toward an eventual planned U.S. fleet of 2,456 planes plus more than 700 additional planes to be sold to allies.” The article went on to mention the F-35B’s upcoming deployment: “The GAO also disclosed that the F-35B — the Marine Corps version of the fighter that’s scheduled to begin ship deployments next year — won’t have required maintenance and repair capabilities at sea and “will likely experience degraded readiness.”” I have always maintained that the most crushing fiscal aspect of fielding a predominantly stealthy manned fighter force is that the cost of operation, especially as the platform ages, will be far greater than the vast majority of the aircraft they replace. Lockheed has claimed that won’t be the case, but there are few metrics, not to mention little logic, available to support such a claim. Although the jet has revised, lower maintenance radar absorbent material coated skin, stealth aircraft have always been maintenance man hour hogs. Combine that with the complexity of the F-35, and it doesn’t take a crystal ball to realize the USAF will have to budget more money for sustainment than it already does for its existing fighter force. USAF As for the spare parts issue, we don’t know how much this has to do with the F-35’s parts and LRU breakage rate and how much it has to do with the supply chain itself. Generally speaking, the services almost myopically concentrate on investing in production instead of sustainment. Fears of program cancellation and special interests drive this, especially for the Pentagon’s high-end purchases. Then the aircraft hits the field with a miserable availability rate due to lack of readily available spare parts. Usually the project office and the manufacturer then scramble to flood the early deployments with spares and direct contractor support so that the “in the field” readiness numbers appear to be improving. The MV-22 Osprey is a near perfect case of this ridiculous phenomenon, so it’s not like the F-35 is alone when it comes to this issue. And depending on the exact metrics, the procurement process could be more to blame than the jet itself. We’ll have to wait and see how the USAF and Lockheed Martin deal with this first deployment as literally the world will be watching—including well over a dozen F-35 customers and perspective buyers. I think you would be safe betting that those 12 F-35s in Japan will be flying constantly, even if it means the nearly 200 other F-35s located back in the states spend even more time on the ground than they already do.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","The Future Of Stealth Is “Morphing Wing” Technology, But Will The B-21 Feature It?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is a quiet revolution going on in the shadowy world of so called “bleeding edge” aerospace research and development, and it has to do with rethinking a key technology that gave birth to manned flight as we know it—the warping wing. The Wright Brothers controlled their Wright Flyer in this manner, and for over a decade after their first flight, the concept was used for all types of early airplanes, including what many see as the first fighter, the Fokker Eindecker . But dedicated control surfaces that were housed on a rigid wing designs quickly became all the rage—and rightfully so—as they greatly expanded the possibilities of aircraft designs using available technology of the era. Fast forward a century and a new form of wing warping, called wing morphing, is quietly becoming one of the most promising new technologies in aviation. Paired with the latest computer technology and advanced composite construction techniques, wing morphing stands to make future airfoils more efficient, lighter, less complex, and even safer. But when it comes to military applications, they also have low observable qualities that could greatly benefit stealthy combat aircraft. There are a number of morphing wing concepts out there today, including replacing traditional wings with ones with far less moving parts and improved airflow, especially at high altitudes. Flaps and ailerons still exist, but they are seamlessly integrated into the wing itself with few, if any joints. Another is using a concept from the Wright Brothers playbook and creating a slight warping wing via composite structures and a “twisting strut” design concept. This could eliminate the need for using any traditional control surfaces while cruising at high altitudes, instead using small changes in the wing’s shape for flight control. The merging of both capabilities would offer unique synergies—using the aircraft’s blended flaps and ailerons during terminal phases of flight or when rapid maneuvers are required, and changing the shape of the wing slightly for less demanding maneuvers during cruise. These attributes are exciting for general and commercial aviation, but when trying to build an air combat aircraft with the smallest radar signature possible, they could truly be game changing—and they may even already exist in an operational or soon to be operational format. Joints are not good for low observability, and flapping around control surfaces exposing those joints are especially bad. Large, seamless, continuously rounded structures that are edge-aligned to the general aircraft design are best for broadband low observability. Smaller pieces of an aircraft, such as its tails and control surfaces, may be able to stay hidden from higher frequency radar systems, like many fire control radars that operate on the X-band (and some that operate in the S and Ku bands), but at lower frequencies they could potential cause a glint on radar operators screens. We live in a time when advanced computer processing is being applied to integrated air defense systems , which can cue multiple types of dissimilar radar and other sensor systems to search a single patch of sky. The data from these sensors can then be “fused” to create a single target track. So what may be invisible to one radar at one angle could be less so by another radar type viewing the same target from a different angle. In the past stealthy aircraft like F-117 may have been visible on radar for short periods of time at certain angles, but not in a way that could allow fire control radar to engage the aircraft—at least without using special tactics and being in the right place at the right time. Electronic warfare support further guarded them from being engaged by enemy SAM sites. Today, as air defense systems become far more complex and networked and the fidelity of lower frequency radars is improved by advanced computer processing that can potentially provide “engagement quality” tracks, especially when their information is fused with various data from other sensors, broadband stealth is more important than ever. As such deep investment into morphing wing technology by major defense contractors and the Pentagon is a given. The B-2 uses a series of split “elevons” as well as flaps and a moving “beaver tail” for controllability (some say it uses differential thrust as well). The smaller RQ-170 uses flaps and pop-out spoilers on its outer wing panels for controllability. Morphing wing technology could drastically lessen flying wing’s reliance on jointed control surfaces, and eventually it could eliminate the need for traditional control surfaces altogether. Below are two videos showing how much these surfaces move both during tanking and refueling as the aircraft’s computer brain keeps the unstable aircraft flying as if it were an inherently stable design: The big question is how far along is this technology in the classified world? There has been talk about various testbeds that have flown to experiment with this capability dating back two decades. Even the Skunk Works flying wing P-175 Polecat demonstrator was supposedly built to test low-grade morphing wing capability that used a twisting wing strut design. That was over a decade ago, and since then there has even been talk that America’s next generation bomber, what is now known as the B-21 Raider , could feature some elements of this technology. Around the same time as the P-175 was being developed, Lockheed pitched the idea of using morphing wing skin for carrying addition fuel for their next generation bomber concept. They would bulge while filled during the early part of the bomber’s mission, and then return to their stealthy shape once the gas is burned off. It is all but fully admitted by the USAF that a high-flying flying wing reconnaissance drone, known unofficially as the RQ-180 , took to the air around the turn of the decade and is likely operating today in a low density manner. This aircraft, which supposedly is a Northrop Grumman product, is said to be extremely low observable in nature and operates at U-2 like altitudes or above. A very efficient laminar flow wing design, one that would have minimal control surfaces but could change shape slightly during different phases of its mission, would be ideal for such a high-flying and very stealthy platform. As such, one has to wonder if morphing wing technology was built into the RQ-180 to even a limited degree, enabling it better achieve its super efficient and very low observable design goals. NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory have flight tested a morphing wing design on one of NASA GIII aircraft. , NASA As The War Zone detailed in a recent feature, B-21 is also going to operate at high altitudes , and is said to be an extremely low observable design. Although we know that mature and semi-mature sub-systems are being used on the aircraft to lower costs and risk, the airframe that these technologies will be packed into has to be cutting edge so that it can remain relevant over decades of service. On the other hand, by all indications it will have the same general shape as Northrop’s original Advanced Technology Bomber design—before the low altitude penetration requirement was thrown on. This design was stealthier and higher flying than the final B-2 Spirit configuration as we know it today with its sawtooth trailing edge. Maybe this shape is old, but what makes up that shape will be anything but, with morphing wing technology built into the overall B-21 design. Integrating even limited morphing wing capability into the B-21 would be a major precedent, and if Northrop Grumman already has that capability flying on another classified program, injecting it into the B-21’s design would not be as high risk as it would otherwise. The B-21’s general planform dates back to the early 1980s, but morphing wing technology could add substantially to its stealthiness and high-flying, long-endurance abilities. , USAF Regardless of if the B-21 features such a capability or not, future stealthy airframes certainly will, including unmanned combat air vehicles which will eventually dominate the realm of aerial warfare. And better low observability, fewer parts—especially those that move—and enhanced wing efficiency is just the starting point for this technology. It is possible that future designs will be able to modify their aerodynamics significantly for different mission profiles or even phases of flight. And this doesn’t just include expanding wing skins that can hold fuel or increasing the camber of a wing for landing and takeoff, but changing the wing’s shape dramatically for loitering, maneuver, high-level, and low-level flight. Think of it as a new form of variable geometry wings, one where “swing-wing” designs of the past will look like antiques. Swing wings were once highly popular features on combat aircraft that allowed for “variable geometry” airfoils that could allow for good low speed handling and efficient high-speed flight. The concept is set to be reborn in a grandiose fashion via morphing wing technology. , National Museum of the USAF The ability to adapt to battle damage is another area where morphing wings may prove to be very useful for military applications. Today, if a combat aircraft loses critical control surfaces it may not be able to make even an emergency landing. But a morphing wing design could potentially compensate for such a loss, providing reduced maneuverability but still enough to see that the heavily damaged aircraft is recoverable. This could be done by tying the aircraft’s fly-by-wire computer brain into the aircraft’s controls surfaces, morphing wing control, and propulsion system. With proper programming, it could be able to provide controllability by using a mix of non-damaged control surfaces, morphing wing capability, and dynamic thrust control to get even a badly damaged aircraft home safe. It is even possible that morphing wings could adapt their shape in response to threat stimuli around them. In other words, if a stealthy flying wing’s onboard radar warning receiver and electronic support measures suite detects a threat radar emanating from a certain location, it could adapt its wing design instantly to best defeat that radar’s particular operating frequency and line of sight angle, all without significantly interrupting the aircraft’s course. All this amounts to more survivable, adaptable, and capable combat aircraft, and it could even mean they will be cheaper to operate and maintain. And although we are still a little ways off from this exciting technology being applied in the commercial space, it is probably safe to say that it already exists, and even may be mature enough to be flying today in an operational form, in the murky classified realm of aerospace technology. And that is a very exciting possibility to comprehend. Suffice it to say that future stealthy combat aircraft with morphing wing technology will be the definition of “more than meets the eye.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia has a long history of executing some of the most spectacular flyovers anywhere in the world. Some even occur during regular training . For decades, F-111 “Pigs” were the centerpiece of the RAAF’s aerial displays, with the aircraft’s ability to “dump and burn” being the ultimate air show and flyover crowd pleaser. Since the F-111’s retirement, Australia’s other combat aircraft have taken on more aerial display missions, with the jet that replaced the F-111, the F/A-18F Super Hornet, becoming the most visible in this role. But even the country’s nimble little Hawk Mk127 trainer can put on a lively flyover. And there are just a few more prominent displays of Aussie air power than the flyover for the annual Gold Coast 600 race held in picturesque Surfers Paradise, Queensland, Australia. This year the Hawk attempted to fill some pretty big shoes, and we have some thrilling in-cockpit footage to show for it. The RAAF’s aerial displays for the event are known to be well below building level, and as you can see, the jet actually maneuvers between the buildings at high speed as part of its display route. Here’s the first and second part of the cockpit video, as well as a perspective from one of the towers: https://youtube.com/watch?v=RXkAxviBAtg https://youtube.com/watch?v=IhMhZ5T0UEc This type of flight by a military fast jet through urban terrain is rare, but it isn’t unheard of outside Australia. Even here in the U.S., the Blue Angels weave between buildings during their display over Chicago’s coastline on Lake Michigan. The Hawk serves as Australia’s intermediate and advanced jet trainer, with 33 examples split across two squadrons. Although the legendary Hawk design is over 40 years old, Australia’s Hawk Mk127s were procured in the late 1990s and they have recently been through a series of technological upgrades. They feature color multi-function displays, updated HUD, and can carry AIM-9 captive training rounds on their wingtips and a 30mm gun pod on their centerline station.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly 61 years to the day since its first flight, the legendary UH-1 is still being exported to militaries abroad. Of course the newest variant of the UH-1, the UH-1Y “Venom,” is very much a different helicopter than its grandfather, having far more in common with the more modern but still dated Twin Huey Super Cobra. Nonetheless, with the news that the US Government approved the sale of UH-1Ys to the Czech Republic, it’s safe to say that Hueys are still in demand in an age when the field of light to medium militarized utility helicopters is crowded to say the least. Under the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) deal, a dozen UH-1Y helicopters will be sold to the Czech Republic, including spares, support, mission-related equipment, and training. The deal will include 25 T-700 GE 401C engines, Brite Star II infrared and electro-optical sensor turrets, AN/AAR-47 missile warning and laser detection systems, AN/ALE-47s countermeasure (flare and chaff) dispensers, AN/APR-38 radar warning receivers, a yet to be identified electronic warfare suite, helmet mounted displays, and M134 GAU-17 7.62mm mini-guns, M240 7.62mm machine guns, and M3M GAU-21 .50 caliber chain guns. The total cost of the contract is $575M. UH-1Y during nighttime ops. , USMC So what we have here is an end-to-end type of sale where sustainment, support systems, training, and pretty much everything else needed to operate the helicopters over a period of time is included into a lump contract. In other words, no, each helicopter does not cost $48M. The new helicopters will replace a portion of the country’s legacy fleet of Eastern Bloc helicopters, including the Mi-2 and Mi-8/17. This may be the UH-1Y’s first export customer, but its close cousin, the AH-1Z Viper is now flying with Pakistani forces—a total of 12 are on order. And both helicopters, which share a high degree of commonality and have a slew of USMC derived tactics that exploit the synergies found by operating both helicopters together, have other prospects for further export potential. Poland’s Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa in particular has worked out deals to cooperate with Bell on both the AH-1Z and UH-1Y programs. According to a press release from Bell dated July 25th, 2017, this is how the relationship is expected to pan out: Pursuant to the LOI, Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa and Bell Helicopter will have discussions regarding the knowledge that may be transferred from the American partner to Polish companies in the arms industry, as well as the possible scope of production and maintenance work which PGZ Group companies may be allowed to perform autonomously if the Ministry of National Defense purchases Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and Bell UH-1Y Venom utility helicopters. “The Letter of Intent that has been signed gives Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa an opportunity to implement world-class helicopter technologies in our factories. I am glad that PGZ Group has taken another step in its business relations with Bell, which will hopefully continue to grow stronger and stronger in the future. Equipping the Polish Armed Forces with state-of-the-art utility and attack helicopters is one of the priorities in the plan to modernize the Polish army. It is our goal to provide the Polish Armed Forces with top-class equipment, which significantly increases Poland’s defence capabilities,” said Błażej Wojnicz, President of the Management Board of PGZ S.A. “We strongly believe this step with PGZ provides a solid basis for further relationships and shows Bell Helicopter’s commitment to supporting Poland’s military objectives and desire for industry growth. Being the newest attack and utility helicopters available on the market, the H-1 program gives our potential industry partners such as PGZ significant area for cooperation,” said Vice President of International Military Business for Bell Helicopter Rich Harris. “The AH-1Z and UH-1Y together provide a common strength that offers the most effective and efficient means of accomplishing the missions in Poland.” AH-1Z and UH-1Y team., DoD All this is well and good, but it still has not resulted in a firm orders from the Polish Ministry of National Defense. But a plan is underway to renew the country’s rotary wing fleet, so orders could be coming in the not so distant future, ones with heavy industrial offsets and some form of technological exchange. Another Polish aerospace firm, PZL, has a similar relationship with Lockheed/Sikorsky for the H-60/S-70 Black Hawk, and this includes a proposed locally assembled gunship variant. With this in mind, the two firms seem to posturing for what could be a brutal competition for the Polish military’s rotary wing future. Romania has a similar agreement with Bell as well, although like Poland, orders have yet to officially materialize. The proposed gunship variant of the PZL Black Hawk., PZL/Lockheed/Sikorsky Assembling and sustaining Vipers and Venoms in Europe could help lead to additional sales, especially now that the Czech Republic’s order has been approved by the U.S. State Department. The latest iterations of the Huey family offer a highly mature and low-risk solution to counter an increasing threat from Russian armor. And having nearly 85% commonality between their combat utility helicopter and attack helicopter types is enticing for cash strapped militaries that see their aging ex-Soviet era fleet of hardware finally wearing out, and the geopolitical realities making further big arms deals with Russia impossible. The UH-1Y in particular is an interesting mix of an old baseline design and new technology. It can be used for so many missions, including combat search and rescue, infiltration and extraction, reconnaissance, utility support, liaison duties, even fire fighting, and the list goes on. It can also be used as a gunship, and with laser guided rockets becoming all the rage, it will have a relatively deep magazine capable of precision attack, allowing it to perform more traditional close air support functions. So there is a lot of bang for buck to be had with the ultimate of all Hueys, and the aircraft is optimized to be reliable while operating in the field, under austere conditions. MARSOC operators practice boarding the UH-1Y via rope ladder. , USMC Other countries, such as Thailand and Morocco, also have interest in these helicopters, and Bell has formally pitched the AH-1Z to Australia in a bid to solve its reconnaissance and attack helicopter woes , as well as the UH-1Y as a special operations platform. With all this in mind, even though the UH-1Y and AH-1Z has been flying operationally for nearly a decade, a rapid blossoming on the export market may be just on the horizon. And that is really an impressive possibility as the Huey enters into its sixth decade of slapping the air into submission in some very rough neighborhoods around the globe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 3, 2017",Northrop Grumman Has Patented A Kinetic Missile Defense System For Stealth Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been talking a lot lately about some cutting-edge technologies that could be incorporated into the upcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber or in other future stealthy aircraft designs. Seeing as evolving integrated air defense system technology will continue to slowly erode some of stealth’s current advantages, electronic warfare, laser defenses, advanced decoys, and even high speed are potential applications that will bolster the survivability of future American air combat assets. But Northrop Grumman may have another trick up its sleeve—a pop out kinetic kill missile defense system that is especially well suited for installation on stealthy aircraft. Think of it as something akin to an airborne Trophy active defense system used on armored vehicles, and a SeaRAM close-in weapon system (CIWS) battery used on naval vessels. The patent (#9,671,200) for the concept, which we first learned of from our friend and Americas bureau chief of Flightglobal.com , Stephen Trimble, during a long back and forth about peculiar aircraft models photographed on a Northrop Grumman executive’s desk, was granted in June of 2017. The patent generally describes the “mini missile defense system” as such: “A missile defense system on an aircraft for destroying threats to the aircraft. The defense system includes at least on miniature guided missile mounted in a launch tube on the aircraft, where the guided missile includes a target acquisition and seeker system. The system also includes at least one sensor on the aircraft for acquiring a target threat, and a controller on the aircraft receiving signals from the at least one sensor. The controller generates a fire control solution that is provided to the at least one guided missile that directs the guide missile once if is fired from the launch tube towards the target threat, and the seeker system on the guided missile acquires the target once it is launched from the aircraft so as to destroy the target.” The patent goes on to illustrate what the system would look like installed on an aircraft: U.S. Patent Office The graphic, which supposedly shows a conceptual “futuristic” combat aircraft, has six pop-out launcher pods with nine miniature defensive missiles each facing both fore and aft (labeled 20 on the graphic). The patent notes that the pods are flush with the aircraft’s skin when retracted. The Patent also says that initial targeting for the defensive missiles can come from the aircraft’s existing sensors (radar, missile approach warning sensors, DAS etc) and/or a proprietary sensor system. The missile itself would have a radar, infrared, or semi-active laser seeker (most likely a combination of the above, and a passive RF homing seeker is also a possibility) that it would use to lock onto and intercept the incoming threat. The patent also notes that the system could be used on fighters, bombers, helicopters and pretty much any other type of aircraft. Though the fact that it specifically shows a stealthy “cranked kite” aircraft design (much like one of the models sitting on that Northrop Grumman exec’s desk) and is built to sit flush with the aircraft’s skin underscores its most probable application—equipping low observable aircraft that will fly into the most hostile airspace on the planet with a hard-kill self defense system. It is possible that the system could also be used to deploy large maneuvering decoys that are capable of actively confusing enemy radar systems and RF missile seekers. Active electronic warfare decoys are becoming increasingly attractive options for providing added survivability to platforms operating near some of the most advanced enemy air defenses in the world. As you can see below, BriteCloud is shown using a similar deployment system. But with Northrop Grumman’s larger mini-missile launchers, similar electronic warfare enabled expendable decoys could add high maneuverability to their capabilities list, potentially making them far more effective. We have talked in great detail about how new miniaturized hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles are in development, with the aim at increasing the magazine depth of stealth fighters with limited internal weapons bay capacity, but those are short to intermediate range missiles with a traditional air-to-air mission, not very short-ranged ones aimed at close-in defense only. And although these missiles, and even the AIM-9X, may have anti-missile capabilities, Northrop Grumman’s concept is clearly intended to be a last line of defense against a missile approaching during the terminal phase of its flight profile, likely intercepting it hundreds of yards up to maybe a few miles from the targeted aircraft. The application of solid-state laser technology onto frontline combat aircraft, such as bombers and fighters, is looked at as a potential solution for close-in defense against incoming missiles. But the fact is that the promising technology simply isn’t ready for such an application, and likely won’t be for another decade or more, at least in the tactical form that we are discussing. Even when the technology is ready, lasers have limitations. They can only engage one threat at a time. Their range and power can be significantly curtailed by atmospheric conditions, such as clouds and smoke. And they aren’t likely be able to provide a 360 degree “sphere of coverage” around a combat aircraft, at least anytime in the foreseeable future. But even if a system could be fitted to a high-flying B-21, giving it good bottom hemisphere coverage, backing it up with a hard kill system capable of engaging threats in any weather conditions and all around the aircraft, makes more sense than not. The company’s rendering of its future penetrating counter-air concept, laser equipped of course. Read more about it here ., Northrop Grumman This is an issue especially for stealthy aircraft that weave through and around the engagement “rings” of layered anti-aircraft systems to reach their targets or station. In such an environment, threats such as road-mobile SAM system can “pop up” out of nowhere, even after careful mission planning leveraging the latest in intelligence has resulted in a plotted course to the aircraft’s destination that maximize its chances of survival. Roving fighter aircraft and the sharp vision of their pilots is also always a threat. In every one of these cases a kinetic kill defensive capability like Northrop Grumman’s would be very good to have. It could even fend off a fighter aircraft attempting a guns kill. And even when lasers are ready to be miniaturized in a powerful form for defensive purposes aboard aircraft, having a “hard kill layer” of defense as well would likely improve the aircraft’s survivability drastically. And as noted earlier, this system could potentially be used for advanced decoys if the miniature interceptors were no longer needed. Finally, a laser system may be able to use the same sensors and guidance system as a kinetic kill system, so there is additional synergistic potential between the two defensive concepts on a development and cost basis as well as on a tactical one. What’s maybe most intriguing about Northrop Grumman’s patent is that we haven’t seen such a system developed before. It really doesn’t feature any technology that isn’t currently in existence, minus a miniaturized interceptor, but that’s shouldn’t be much of a hurdle developmentally speaking. Other “soft kill” directed energy base defensive systems that use similar targeting systems have been flying on American and allied aircraft for many years and even Russia is introducing the capability now. But considering how advantageous a missile shield around combat aircraft could be, especially those that fly alone in the riskiest of environments or are high-demand, low density nature, it’s strange we haven’t seen this capability developed before. Oddly enough, Russia has implied that it is eyeing something similar for its own high-end bomber fleet. Rendering of the B-21 Raider., Northrop Grumman With the patent being issued just recently, and considering its flush-mounted design, one has to wonder if this concept is intended to wind up on the company’s B-21 Raider. We still know virtually nothing about what technologies are being integrated into the USAF’s new multi-role stealth strategic platform, but the aircraft’s ability to survive even in the most contested environments is of the utmost importance. Other Northrop Grumman projects would undoubtedly benefit from such a system, and who knows, maybe its already flying clandestinely on one of them. At this point in time it is totally uncertain when we will get more information on the B-21’s features and subsystems, yet alone seeing one in wild. But don’t be too surprised if a short-range missile defense system ends up being part of its package of survivability enhancing systems that will allow it to threaten pretty much any target anywhere in the world, at any time.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Soviet era’s enigmatic wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) “ekranoplans” are set to make a comeback according to various Russian media reports . In particular, a massive 600 ton design that is intended to carry out resupply and search and rescue missions in the Arctic is said to be in development, with flight testing planned for sometime in 2022 or 2023.Â The design, dubbed “Rescuer” is described as being be 305 feet long with a wingspan of 233 feet. Supposedly the craft’s large size was decided upon due to its ability to operate in rougher sea states than smaller alternatives and because it can fly over long distances, described by Russian sources as “several thousand kilometers.”Â Naval expert Alexander Mozgovoy told the Russian news paper Izvestia that “ekranoplans are much more economical than airplanes, it will be possible to quickly move more cargo for a longer distance… If they manage to equip their air-cushioned landing gear, they will be able to land even on snow ridges.” According to these claimed metrics, we are talking about a remake of the largest ekranoplan ever created, known commonly as the Caspian Sea Monster. That craft got its name from startled CIA image intelligence analysts who spotted the huge and mysterious craft in satellite imagery during the depth of the Cold War. Due to its strange configuration and the KM painted on its wings, it was first dubbed the “Kaspian Monster.” This later morphed into “Caspian Sea Monster,” a reference to the mythical Loch Ness Monster. In reality the KM stood for “Prototype Ship” in Russian.Â The Caspian Sea Monster flew in testing for 15 years, starting in 1965 until it crashed in 1980. Fast forward to today, and the once shadowy Soviet-era program has captured the imagination of the public, with the charismatic ekranoplans being fairly popular topics seen in everything from documentaries to technology blogs. But even with all the hype, the fact is that large wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) aircraft never caught on, albeit much smaller models have been produced for certain applications. Iran in particular has a pocket armada of small WIG aircraft.Â This undated photo released on September 28, 2010, by the Iranian Defense Ministry, allegedly shows the Bavar-2, or Confidence-2, radar-evading flying boats. Iran’s state TV says the country’s powerful Revolutionary Guard has received its first three squadrons of radar-evading flying boats., VAHID REZA ALAEI/AFP/Getty Images Supposedly the giant “Rescuer” will feature a wingspan more than 100 feet wider than the one found on Caspian Sea Monster, which actually makes sense considering it’s planned for the type to include traditional landing gear as well as its boat-shaped hull. This amphibian format would theoretically allow the aircraft to fly at higher altitudes, outside of ground effect, but with far less efficiency, while also giving it access to traditional airstrips. Many Soviet-era ekranoplans also had the goal of flying at higher altitudes as well as in their standard WIG mode.Â TASS reports that Central Design Bureau for SEC Alekseev will be executing the design part of the project on behalf of the Russian Navy.Â The image of a “Rescuer” model (top of post) shown to Russian officials and industry personnel at an arms expo looks more like the smaller but similar Lun class Ekranoplan than the Caspian Sea Monster. It’s possible that the Lun class design was sized up to meet certain requirements, and it’s not like the Lun class wasn’t a massive machine in its own right. Unlike its larger progenitor, the more modern Lun class actually saw limited served in the active fleet during the late 1980s and 1990s. The Lun class has the anti-ship missile tubes along its spine, it can be seen throughout this video, along with other Russian ekranoplans: https://youtube.com/watch?v=iINbB1Y5F4c Russia is said to also be actively developing a medium-sized ekranoplan for use in the Caspian and Baltic seas. Dubbed the A-050 “Seagull,” this WIG flying boat will have a displacement of approximately one tenth of the “Rescuer” design, or around 54 tons, and is slated to can carry 100 passengers. The interior of the 115 foot hybrid aircraft will look like an airliner and in total it can carry 18,000lbs.Â Its intended uses include passenger service, cargo hauling, environmental monitoring, and working for the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations. Most ekranoplans have the ability to access unimproved beach areas, which along with their high speed and heavy lifting ability, makes them pretty useful for disaster response. #Russia 's GEV aka ekranoplan Chaika A-050 project gets its design finalized, now capable of carrying 100 people, scheduled for 2020-22 pic.twitter.com/8Ocbe4mPiq — Russian Embassy in South Africa ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º (@EmbassyofRussia) August 23, 2017 The roughly 737-sized Seagull is in development now according to the Russian government, with a flight test scheduled for 2022. The Seagull is one thing, but many readers will have their doubts about Russia anteing up for a massive ekranoplan and the costs that go along with developing it. A high degree of skepticism is understandable, especially since Moscow is having troubling paying for updates on some of its existing ships and in funding other high-profile defense programs .Â But we do know that one place Russia seems willing to spend big money is in the Arcticâ€”a place Moscow views as a strategic stronghold that can be dominated early on for control of the region’s energy reserves and emerging shipping routes. In fact, the Russian Navy is building a specialized fleet just for this region , along with a massive Arctic “research” submarine . In addition, Russia is developing elaborate outposts and surveillance sites in the Arctic, and these are far from temporary emplacements. Constant Russian military drills have also occurred in the area since 2014. With an expanding footprint in the frigid arctic, logistics are likely a major hurdle, and a craft like an ekranoplan may be an ideal long-term solution worth investing in. Outside of its stated humanitarian and support missions, the “Rescuer” is a fast ski-skimming target (around 300mph) that is impervious to submarine torpedoes or mine warfare. In essence, this is an access weapon as much as anything else.Â Also keep in mind that literally decades of research, testing, and operations have already been accumulated on very similar designs. Add in modern engine and airframe manufacturing technology and such an endeavor would be far less expensive than starting from scratch. Russia may see opportunity in this fact alone. And it’s not like other major military powers haven’t Â procured “unique” transport capabilities to help satisfy their own extra territorial ambitions as of late. Whatever the case, it seems as if the ekranoplan is about to experience some sort of a renaissance in Russia in the coming years, even if ends up being of a smaller scale than that of the historic Caspian Sea Monster. It will be interesting to see if the concept finally pays off, or if this revival of sorts ends up being short lived.Â One thing that we do know for sure is that the world would be a more exciting place with ekranoplans skimming the seas.

Ranging from the hilarious squadron videos from the pre-Tailhook scandal era, to Cal’s Used Fighter Jet Emporium , to no-nonsense defense contractor promotional reels , box set documentaries, government instructional tapes, and just about everything in between. And by “in between” we mean this at first seemingly outright corny, but turns out to be actually pretty awesome instructional supplement video made by the software development firm known for their simulators, Spectrum HoloByte. This video in particular was made for their hugely popular FALCON 3.0 air combat simulator based around the F-16. The video is early 1990s nostalgia central—the set, the music, the serious tone, and make sure to stay tuned for the clunky Thrustmaster cockpit simulator bookend ad at the end. The very well cast F-16 instructor pilot and host, Pete “Boomer” Bonanni , does an outstanding job at describing Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) tactics, and he even uses that “cutting-edge” tele-illustrator in the process. The “students” in their flight suits are pretty hilarious looking, but they do help with filling out the presentation. Overall the entire time capsule of a video is really worth watching, both for nostalgic laughs and for brushing up on your BFM knowledge base. This second video—which is unrelated production-wise to the first but compliments it nicely—gives us a quick tour of the early F-16C (Block 25) cockpit configuration. It goes into some of the improvements over the earlier F-16A’s cockpit features, and also gives a run-down on the basic Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) pod concept which would find itself on the Block 40 variant of the USAF F-16C/D.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 12, 2018","No, B-2s Aren’t Deployed To The Pacific And They Didn’t Fly Near Near Korea","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lot’s of headlines today about B-2s deploying to the Pacific and even those implying they flew a deterrence missions near the Korean Peninsula. We cannot corroborate these claims. In fact, military plane trackers on the net have shown a very different story. From what we can tell, two B-2As, callsigns MYTEE51 and MYTEE52, left their home at Whiteman AFB in Missouri and headed toward Andersen AFB in Guam on October 28th. One of the B-2s appeared to turn back midway during its flight. This is not totally uncommon both for “air-spare” reasons or due to mechanical issues. The one B-2 continued on to its forward staging base at Andersen AFB, Guam and then returned very early the next day, October 29th, to Whiteman AFB. The chances the jet flew a deterrence mission in between are next to zero bordering on impossible. Although the flight did occur while Defense Secretary James Mattis was making a high profile visit to South Korea, it wasn’t publicized at the time and there isn’t any indication that it was intended to overtly “pressure” the leadership in Pyongyang. Just today it was officially disclosed to have occurred by U.S. Pacific Command, who said little about beyond posting a couple of pictures of it on its social media accounts. The reasons for such a mission are numerous and multi-fold. Even B-2 pilots, who aren’t known for racking up high hours in the type on a regular basis, need real mission training, as do the people on the ground who support the Spirit’s unique operational needs. Ultra long-range Global Power missions are the keystone of B-2 combat doctrine . Simulators help prepare B-2 crews for these flights but actually getting out there and executing them is very important, as is familiarizing crews with at least some of the B-2’s three remote operating locations—Fairford, Diego Garcia, and Guam. On the move in its element—the dark of night—a B-2 heads to Guam from Whiteman AFB., USAF More B-2 training flights to Guam could soon be underway as U.S. Strategic Command kicks off exercise “Global Thunder 2017.” Here’s how this year’s iteration of the exercise is described by a STRATCOM press release : “U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) will commence Global Thunder, an annual command and control and field training exercise, Oct. 30, 2017. The Global Thunder series is designed to exercise all USSTRATCOM mission areas and assess joint operational readiness. “These exercises achieve the vision of a unified team, integrating all the capabilities of U.S. Strategic Command across the globe wherever and whenever needed,” said U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of USSTRATCOM. “We need to integrate our strategic capabilities in order to deliver multi-domain effects against any adversary, anywhere in the world, at any time.” Headquarters staff, USSTRATCOM components and subordinate units are participating in Global Thunder 2018 to test readiness to confront uncertainty and ensure a safe, secure, effective and ready strategic deterrent force. One of nine DOD unified combatant commands, USSTRATCOM has global responsibilities assigned through the Unified Command Plan that include strategic deterrence, space operations, cyberspace operations, joint electronic warfare, global strike, missile defense and intelligence” It’s possible that last weekend’s flights could have also served double duty for repositioning Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to Guam as part of contingency preparations for an air campaign over North Korea. The 40,000lb super-bunker buster will be absolutely essential for any major air war aimed at wiping out North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, as well as for destroying key regime targets, many of which are buried under mountains. Short of nuclear weapons, no other penetrating munition on earth stands a chance at destroying these targets, with temporarily sealing their entrances being the only other possibly feasible option short of a commando raid. As we have discussed in detail before , the B-2 will be essential in any war plan against North Korea. It will serve to drop MOPs on key targets as well as executing destruction of enemy air defenses missions against North Korea’s fixed air defense system sites and airfields. MOPs can also be transported by heavy transports, like the C-17, but it may just be easier and more effective for training purposes to fly the munitions out to the island outpost on B-2 training flights, where the weapons would be downloaded from the jets and stored after they arrive. Once again, none of this is to say that the B-2 won’t soon take up station at Andersen AFB in Guam. The stealth bombers rotate in and out of the base, sharing the forward deployed bomber rotation mission with their B-52 and B-1 brethren. The B-1 has fulfilled this role for over a year, having returned to Andersen AFB for the first time in a decade in August of 2016. For a period after the B-1’s arrival, it, the B-2, and the B-52 were all present at Andersen AFB at the same time . B-2A “Spirit of Missouri” launches at night from Whiteman AFB on its way to Guam., USAF The B-1B has gone on to fly many so called “show of force” flights near North Korea, often being accompanied by various local fighter aircraft, including armed USMC F-35Bs on one especially provocative flight. The B-1B is not capable of carrying the MOP (nor nuclear weapons), and its ability survive over North Korea during the opening stages of an air war is highly doubtful, but they would lug stealthy cruise missiles near the peninsula for standoff attacks and possibly attack targets along the DMZ early on during an actual war. We’ll have to wait to see if the B-2 beds down on Guam in the near future, and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford has alluded to potential strategic shifts in the region in response to the growing threat faced by North Korea. But as of now this is simply not the case.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 20, 2017",Delivery Of Russia’s Refit Nuclear Battlecruiser Delayed But Progress Looks Impressive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Kirov class nuclear powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov has been in dry dock undergoing a deep refit for years now, with the promise being the ship would come out the other side basically new, with a whole host of new weapons and sensors. The Russian Navy’s plan is to eventually have two massive Kirov class ships operational at the same time, which will be a first in nearly two decades. Before that can happen Admiral Nakhimov’s refit needs to be completed, after which the Pyotr Veliky ( Peter the Great ), which soldiers on today with largely all its Soviet-era weapons and sensors , will replace it in dry dock. After the Pyotr Veliky is refit to the same standard as the Admiral Nakhimov the two battlecruisers could potentially roam the seas for decades to come. Executing a deep refit it on a severely dated, 28,000 ton nuclear battlecruiser that has sat idle for over a decade and a half years in the frigid White Sea is no small task. In fact, the Russian Navy’s initiative to refit the Admiral Nakhimov is a decade old, with work only really picking up steam in 2014. And now the news is that the ship’s delivery will be pushed back yet another year, to 2021. Admiral Nakhimov which was originally named Kalinin, photographed circa 1991, just three years after she was commissioned into service—The fall of the Soviet Union was not kind to the Russian Navy’s fleet, but Admiral Nakhimov has survived and is slated to return to the sea far more powerful than it ever was before. , DoD Originally the project was going to end in the latter part of this decade, around 2018. Then it was pushed back to 2019, and then 2020. Normally this would sound like the whimpering end to yet another over ambitious and under funded Russian weapons initiative , but in this case it appears to be quite the opposite. Images and video shot recently of the giant surface combatant show it receiving a lot of attention, with many portions of the vessel totally gutted, especially areas where new weapons and sensors will go in the place of old ones. Scaffolding encompasses almost the entire vessel, and even its red hull paint paint look fresh. The ship has been totally stripped and its green and red base coat definitely give it a Klingon-like vibe. , Youtube screencap There is no question that the ship’s refit is deeply underway and that it’s not just a cosmetic facelift and bolt-on remodel aimed to squeeze a few more years out of a tired old design, it’s a total rework of the vessel that is very unlikely to not come to fruition with so much momentum behind hit. And once Sevmash shipyard is finished, Admiral Nakhimov, which was launched in 1986 , is slated to bristle with modern weaponry. Once finished, the ship will be the pride of the Russian Navy., Youtube screencap The refit ship is slated to feature a whopping 174 vertical launch tubes—more than any other surface combatant or submarine in the world. 80 of these tubes will be filled with modern Russian cruise missiles, such as the subsonic Kalibr , supersonic Onix , and supposedly the hypersonic Zircon . Additionally, the ship’s air defense capability will be adapted from the S-400 system and will have the rest of its tubes stuffed with the family of missiles associated with it (40N6, 48N6, 9M96). In addition, pretty much every combat related system on the ship is supposedly going to be replaced with modern components and many of the ship’s other systems will also be overhauled. The work is being done by Sevmash shipbuilding. Video showing just how extensive the work on Admiral Nakhimov is (starts at 4:45): You can see just how huge the old SS-N-19 “Shipwreck” missile farm was in this still from the video above. VLS cells will fill this space where 20 angled SS-N-19 launch tubes were previously., Youtube screencap Once completed, both ships will serve as the centerpieces of Russian flotillas and will be the largest Russian fighting vessels in operation until—or if—the carrier Admiral Kuzetsov comes out of its own refit, which has supposedly been slashed in scope recently due to budgetary concerns. Some would argue that putting so much into these dinosaurs from the Cold War era is a waste of scarce funds that could be used to build smaller surface combatants and more submarines. But seeing how far along the Admiral Nakhimov is, the proverbial “ship has sailed” on that debate, and Pyotr Veliky will likely cost far less to modify because it is in good operational condition today and Admiral Nakhimov has already served as an experimental template for the refit. Project 23560 destroyer, also known as the Lider class, was seen as a potential replacement for the Kirov class. But that program has been set aside aside before it even got truely started due to budget concerns., Artem  Tkachenko/wikimedia With Russia’s long-hyped but now sidelined Lider class super destroyer no longer in potential competition with the Kirov class, at least not in the foreseeable future, these huge Russian surface combatants will continue on in a class of their own.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 18, 2018",We Finally Know Where Those Surplus Jordanian F-5 Tiger IIs Ended Up (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Private red air contractor TacAir is the purchaser of the ex-Jordanian F-5Es that we wrote about being pulled off a 747-400F in Florida last February. The aircraft were going to be overhauled by the Northrop Grumman plant located in St. Augustine that also supports the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-5Ns , and has upgraded other air arms’ aging Tiger IIs with structural and avionics enhancements over the years. These aircraft were the only four delivered from Jordan to the U.S. via air, with the other 17 examples being shipped via ocean freighter to the facility. In all, 21 ex-Jordanian F-5E/F airframes were purchased as part of the deal. These aircraft will drastically augment TacAir’s current F-5 fleet, which includes an F-5B and three CF-5D Freedom Fighters, the latter of which are license-built Canadian derivatives of Northrop’s first generation F-5. All four aircraft are two seat variants. More Project birds! Greg and the boys in Florida with TacAir and Cujo flying the mighty F-5 pic.twitter.com/kJNdnSCc7b — National Test Pilot School (@TheNTPS) November 9, 2016 Aviation Week’s James Drew notes that about half the Jordanian order have been delivered to TacAir, either conveniently to their St. Augustine satellite location or to their headquarters at Stead Field in Reno, Nevada. Half will wear the black, white, and gray “splinter” camouflage with the other half wearing a desert brown motif. As we have mentioned in the past, the F-5 may be a dated airframe, but it is a highly reliable and efficient one. With new sensor options that are available off the shelf, the type can offer 4th generation fighter-like capabilities at a fraction of the cost. TacAir writes in their platform description the following about their unique F-5s: “While the baseline F-5 flown by USN/USMC is widely considered a 3en Generation aircraft, TacAir’s existing and planned upgrades economically evolve this aircraft into an advanced tactical aircraft with sensor/system capabilities on par with current DoD 4th Generation fighter aircraft. TacAir F-5s are upgraded with HUD/HOTAS [Heads Up Display/Hands On Throttle And Stick], open architecture mission computers and tailored Operational Flight Programs that enable integration of advanced radar systems, IRST [ Infrared Search and Track ], EA [Electronic Attack], RWR [Radar Warning Receiver], datalinks, and HOBS [ High Off Boresight ] simulated weapons employment.” The main upgrade that would make these aircraft able to perform 4th generation fighter threat replication would be the inclusion of a modern radar system. TacAir’s website associates their aircraft with both the Grifo-200 and APG-66 pulse doppler radars, although it is unclear if these sets have actually replaced the AN/APG-153/159 radars originally installed in most F-5s or if new radar systems like the ones mentioned will be integrated into their F-5 fleet if the company wins a major adversary support contract. The company’s ex-Jordanian F-5E/Fs have been totally refreshed by Northrop Grumman., TACAIR It’s also worth noting that both radar sets are currently flying with TacAir’s competitor, Draken International—the Grifo on their L159s and the APG-66 on their A-4Ks . Other radar options for the F-5 exist as well, such as Israel’s modular and highly capable Elta EL/M-2032 radar set . TacAir has been around for quite some time. The company has been associated with many platforms over the years, but not in a large operational format. These have included L-29 “Vipers,” Super Tucanos, and even Su-27s which are prominently featured in their logo. They were the outfit that was originally tied to the procurement of two ex-Ukrainian Su-27s that were refurbished by Pride Aircraft before they were put up for sale only to disappear into the shadows of the classified world. During the late 2000s, a pair of the company L-29 “Viper” jets were shipped to Hawaii aboard USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD-6) for adversary support contract. The Navy uses its “commercial air services” providers to act as targets for its ships as well as aircraft, with aircraft often flying anti-ship missile profiles., USN The company’s website notes that they have current experience in operating “customer owned” Su-27s as well as F-16s. They also provide close air support/Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training. Above all else, the company is known for its consulting work on various projects and operations related to air combat, munitions, and adversary support duties. The company describes their deep bench of highly experienced aircrew and subject matter experts as such: “The TacAir team brings the strongest cadre of proven leaders and aviators paired with a modern, sustainable, safe and upgradeable fighter platform. This diverse staff consists of former Weapons School Instructors, Graduates, Adversaries, and Test Pilots including: a Former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff who is the Chairman of the Board, 4 former Air Wing/Group Commanders, 12 former US Air Force/US Marine Corps & US Navy Squadron Commanders,  a former Operational Test Squadron Commander, 4 Test Pilots, 3 former Weapons School Commanders, 52 Weapons School Graduates, 17 former Weapons School Instructors, and 2 Astronauts.” With the Navy and the USAF having large adversary support contracts up for grabs, and more to be had internationally, TacAir’s growing F-5 fleet strategy is an intriguing one. It represents a known and cost effective commodity for both the USAF and especially the USN and Marines. The type has served continuously as an adversary for over 40 years. For a good portion of that time it filled out the ranks of various USAF aggressor squadrons around the globe, and maybe most notably, it was a staple of the Navy’s Fighter Weapons School, better known as Topgun. It also starred in the movie by the same name as the “MiG-28.” You can read all about how the F-5 was employed by Topgun instructors as an adversary aircraft in this past War Zone feature. F-5s served at Nellis AFB as part of the 65th AGRS starting in 1974., USAF The F-5 has stood the test of time in adversary service, with three squadrons of the jets—two US Navy and one Marine—still going strong. And the USMC in particular is so happy with the type that they want more of them , which is a good sign for TacAir. The jet has other attributes going for it beyond being proven and reliable. It’s capable of supersonic speeds, is hard to spot, and agile in its own right. Overall it remains a credible adversary when flown by a highly experienced pilot. When paired with an upgraded pulse doppler radar and cockpit displays it could prove to be a very efficient platform that is capable of meeting the 4th generation adversary threshold requirements but at a far lower operating cost than more complex alternatives. And once again, its ability to travel at supersonic speeds gives it an edge over the handful of subsonic radar equipped tactical aircraft now flying in the contractor air services arena. Certain synergies could also potentially be had with the Navy and Marine Corps’ existing fleet of roughly 45 F-5N and F-5F aggressors, especially in terms of sustainment, upgrades, and tactics development. Also, training TacAir F-5 pilots would likely be easier and far less expensive than doing so with a foreign type as Navy and Naval Reserve pilots already flying the F-5 or who had done so previously could port directly over to TacAir ranks. Even USAF pilots have time in the T-38 Talon, which was the progenitor of the F-5 and shares many similarities with it. TACAIR On the other hand, if the services are willing to spend more on an operator that brings a true 4th generation aircraft to the table, such as via the F-16, TacAir may have a tough time competing with their F-5s. But this seems unlikely considering the whole idea of outsourcing some of a service’s adversary support needs is to increase capacity while saving money in the process. Additionally, one service’s needs aren’t the same as another’s, or that of an international air arm who may need a one-size-fits-all higher-end adversary support source, or just cheap supersonic target replication to challenge their 5th generation F-35s. With all this in mind, TacAir seems well suited to fulfill the lower-end supersonic 4th generation adversary support niche, and even if they aren’t selected for a contract, they could easily bolster the company that is with more capacity or be added on in additional future contracts. As I have been stating for many years —before many people recognized the looming contractor adversary air support industry boom—as F-35 comes online, the Pentagon and other air arms that operate it will have an insatiable appetite for commercial adversary support. This is due to the high operating costs of stealth fighters, the need to prolong their airframe life, the waste associated in using them to replicate rudimentary adversary capabilities in mock combat, and due to the fact that they will require greater numbers of adversaries to challenge their pilots. This means more targets in the arena at one time—a perfect job for the spritely and efficient F-5—especially one equipped with a decent radar and a datalink. UPDATE: We talked to TacAir’s Mick Guthals about their F-5s and their business plans related them and he confirmed pretty much everything in this article, but added a few additional bits of information. Beyond being a known and economical commodity with great manufacturer support, the F-5’s ease of upgrade is a major selling point for the jet. As we discussed earlier, many off-the-shelf upgrades exist for the F-5E/F and that means integration costs would be minimal. A foreign fighter like the Mirage F-1, which has deeply integrated avionics, would likely require more investment to reconfigure the aircraft with new technologies, especially ones not available from the OEM but from a third party supplier. As for if these aircraft will provide basic fighter maneuvers (BFM or dogfighting basically) training, Guthals noted that the services really haven’t fully developed the role of the commercial adversary. As I have reported in the past, a big misconception is that commercial adversary support providers basically dogfight with fleet pilots. That isn’t the case. By most accounts even aircraft armed with AIM-9M Sidewinder captive training rounds—a new development in this decade—are usually limited to 180 degree “turning” fight before having to “knock it off.” In other words, the hard turning “fur ball” dogfights are left for organic adversary support. But this could change as contractors become more deeply embedded into the Pentagon’s air combat training apparatus. The general target for contractor adversary providers is to provide an adversary aircraft at 60% of the cost of the fleet alternative. Basically, if intercept practice is needed by an F-15 squadron, using the contracted F-5 should cost 40% less than it would cost for the USAF to put up another F-15 for that role—which is common practice today and hugely wasteful. Using contractors will also allow for a more tailored and cost effective use of airframes to support adversary training. For instance, a USAF F-15 may get another F-15 as a sparring partner for BFM training, but the next day a contractor F-5 can be used instead of a fleet F-15 for radar intercept training. Additionally, these assets can be mixed and matched to provide a better training syllabus without busting the budget. Even different levels of contractor adversary aircraft, such as F-16 and F-5, can be used for different training objectives. Guthals also said that exactly what upgrades TacAir’s F-5s would receive, such as new radars and helmet mounted displays, will be based on what the customer wants. This will also be factored into the cost of supplying the aircraft for training. So at this point, the jet’s are freshened up, but not loaded with new sensors and such because the company wants to tailor the aircraft’s configuration to the customer’s needs. This makes sense as these types of upgrades are not cheap for air arms, yet alone private entities. We will keep you up to date as TacAir’s ambitious business plans unfold.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",South Korea Installing Thermal Sights On Its Vulcan Anti-Aircraft Guns For Good Reason,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Republic Of Korea (ROK) forces will begin having their decades old 20mm Vulcan anti-aircraft guns updated with thermal imaging sensors by 2019, and there is good reason for doing so. North Korea has multiple interdiction techniques that feature very low radar cross-section platforms that would fly at night and at very low altitude into South Korean airspace during a time of war—with some likely passing well within the engagement envelopes of South Korea’s M167A3 towed Vulcan Air Defense Systems (VADS) and K263A1 self-propelled derivative of the VADS, which is based on the K200 Korean Infantry Fighting Vehicle. These North Korean interdiction platforms include throngs of low-flying An-2 biplanes and paragliders . These aircraft would deliver hardened special operations soldiers, with some of them venturing deep into South Korean territory, on one-way missions. Here’s how we described this set of asymmetric tactics in a recent post on the An-2’s unique role within North Korea’s order of battle: “During the dark of night, as part of the opening throws of a battle royale between South Korea, the U.S. and North Korea, hundreds of these old radial engine biplanes will fly low over the ground at slow speed, penetrating deep into South Korean airspace. For the vast majority of their crews it will be a one-way mission—to deliver Kim Jong Un’s hardest shock troops deep behind enemy lines. This is done via low altitude air drop, as seen above, or by landing in short stretches of fields or roadways. The missions of these North Korean suicide assault teams are many fold, but generally they pertain to creating total havoc deep inside South Korean territory. This includes attacking key infrastructure and military installations, and generally sowing massive terror among the already frightened South Korean populace. This deep insertion tactic alone is one of the main reasons why installations like air bases in South Korea must be prepared for instant war, even on the foot soldier level.” There is also a growing threat from North Korean unmanned aircraft which have been penetrating into South Korean territory for years now on reconnaissance missions . North Korean drones are rudimentary, but they could also be launched in large quantities to crudely attack various locales in South Korea, or even potentially deliver chemical or biological agents . The ongoing nuisance of North Korean propaganda leaflet toting balloons landing in South Korea territory has also become more pronounced as of late. Various types of North Korean drones have crashed in South Korea over the last decade, with their capabilities slowly becoming more advanced over time., AP As you can see, the need is clear for short-range air defenses (SHORADs) that can detect, track, and engage small targets with tiny radar signatures and in the darkness of night. Fitting existing Vulcan Air Defense Systems with a thermal targeting system is at least a relatively inexpensive partial solution to the problem. ROK forces train with their M167 Vulcan Air Defense System. It’s a tight little package that has a range of up to a couple miles. , DoD Currently South Korean VADS have optical radar assisted targeting, with a dated AN/TVS-5 night vision scope being used for engaging targets after sundown. But compared to a thermal/infrared system, the very narrow field of view and non thermal imaging night vision sight is a poor, if not totally unworkable solution to problem. The telescope-like AN/TVS-5 was developed in the 1970s for low-light weapons targeting., FAS.org If the thermal targeting system is equipped with a boresighted laser rangefinder, M167A3 and K263A1 operators could know exactly when the target is within their cannon’s reach. It may be possible to use the VADS radar to do this as well if it is sensitive enough to lock onto the target once the thermal system gets in pointed in exactly the right position. The Vulcan Air Defense System (VADS) was introduced into US Army service 1967. The M167 is a self-contained trailer mounted anti-aircraft system based around the M61 Vulcan 20mm cannon that was already becoming the standard gun in fighter aircraft of the era. Earlier versions were optically guided by a crew of two, with a radar only used for ranging, but later versions included a fire control radar that actively assisted in targeting. A self propelled version of the VADS was also put into service. It used the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier as a chassis and was dubbed the M163. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wNxr5fJ4XUY VADS provided the lowest tier of air defense both for soldiers in the field and for high value installations. It can be rapidly redeployed with troops on the move and it had a max rate of fire of roughly 3,000 rounds per minute, which was de-rated from the aircraft version of the M61 Vulcan that could fire upwards of 6,000 rounds per minute. But still, even at 3,000 rounds per minute, VADS’ 1,000 round magazine would be depleted quickly during a multi-target engagement. Lower rates of fire down to about 1,000 rounds per minute are also available for operators to select. M163 VADS at Fort Irwin in 1988., US Army Beginning in 1994, VADS was replaced by AN/TWQ-1 Avenger system that soldiers on till this day. The VADS concept had something of a rebirth of sorts in the mid 2000s in the form of the Centurion counter rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) system, which itself was based on the sea-going Mk15 Phalanx close-in weapons system (CIWS). Centurion shared a similar 20mm Vulcan cannon but it was a much more cumbersome and complex system than VADS, and its mission was different, being used for defeating indirect fire attacks, not taking down aircraft. Even though VADS has been out of service with U.S. forces for many years, a bunch of these systems were exported around the globe with about a half dozen countries still using them today. Some of these systems are upgraded to include FLIR turrets, networking, and other enhancements. South Korea’s K263A1., Republic of Korea Armed Forces The ironic thing is that VADS is that it is becoming relevant once again, not just along the DMZ and near key installations in South Korea, but also in the ranks of the U.S. Army’s combat units that could find themselves undertaking expeditionary missions in contested territory in the not so distant future. We have detailed America’s gaping short-range air defense gap , and especially U.S. ground forces vulnerability to low-end drones . An upgraded VADS could be at least a temporary solution for providing formations of American troops with a quick-reacting and available form of close-in air defense. This type could also augment the aging Avenger, with its eight Stinger missiles and far less powerful .50 caliber gun, and do the same for new systems that are more focused on using expensive missiles for short-to-intermediate range air defense than relatively cheap and plentiful 20mm cartridges. South Korean VADS after use. , ROK With tensions at unprecedented levels on the Korean Peninsula, South Korea doesn’t need such a capability to counter a potential threat sometime in the future, they need this capability to counter a threat that could rear its ugly head tonight. And even though these systems won’t be able to take down anywhere near what the North could potentially throw at them, they can make a big dent in Pyongyang’s infiltration and drone attack plans. This alone could save a lot of lives and allow for ROK and US forces to better defend themselves from such an onslaught of semi-suicidal commandoes. Also, VADS could help provide a last line of aerial defense for high value installations and other key facilities that North Korea may specifically target using non-traditional means.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 22, 2019",The Pentagon Is Quietly Developing A Next Generation Long-Range Air-To-Air Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the latest and likely the last major iteration of the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the D model, spreads throughout the services and America’s allies’ weapons caches, there has been great speculation as to what will come next, and real concern that the Pentagon has not moved fast enough or in a consistent enough manner to field a next generation long-range air-to-air missile. Now it appears that a new initiative has been quietly underway for two years now to do just that. Our friend and Flightglobal.com Americas Bureau Chief Stephen Trimble posted a report today identifying a obscure line-item under the Office of the Secretary of Defense in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (the Pentagon’s budget) called “emerging capabilities technology development.” Trimble notes that this is usually attributed to small electronic warfare programs, not new air-to-air missile development. But in this case it included a program dubbed Long Range Engagement Weapon, or LREW for short. This program has worked as an exploratory initiative used to identify the overall concept, technologies, kill chain structure, and baseline requirements for a new long-range air-to-air missile or family of missiles. Officially the program is aimed at “maintaining America’s air dominance.” Now the classified results of the program are supposedly being funneled down to the services where they are likely to morph into a hardware development program of record. Trimble also included an official piece of concept art from the program in his post which clearly shows a two-stage missile design being launched from the weapons bay of an F-22 Raptor. Although we have no clear indication if this is the final LREW concept being passed down for further evaluation and development, the fact that it clearly shows a two-stage air-to-air weapon is interesting to say the least. Such a weapon could leverage a new family of small, hit-to-kill, intermediate to short-range air-to-air missiles as primary payload attached to a booster. This would maximize weight for propellant and the payload weapon could also be used without a booster for far shorter range engagements. Whether such a setup would fit into a weapons bay of an F-22 or F-35 isn’t known, although the artwork implies it would. But regardless, at the ranges it could potentially engage enemy targets, being fired from a low observability host platform has diminishing advantages. A Langley AFB based F-22A Raptor fires off an AIM-120 during training., USAF We have discussed small hit-to-kill missiles, long-range air-to-air missiles, and the tactics surrounding both of them before. This includes using an “arsenal ship” such as an F-15, to lug long-range missiles into a position well behind a flight of stealth fighters operating along or beyond the forward edges of the enemy’s airspace, and using their sensor “picture” for providing targeting for these weapons via data-link . The long-range air-to-air missile would then be launched remotely by the F-15 operating in safer airspace, with the networked weapon flying to a high altitude while being fed targeting updates from the stealth fighters via data link, before diving down on their targets at high speed. Alternatively, such a missile can give 4th generation fighters with large radar apertures and powerful AESA radar arrays, once again like the F-15C, a new lease on life, as it can take full advantage of the radar’s extreme range as well as an increasingly networked battlespace. If this new long-range missile, or a version of it, can fit into a F-35 or F-22’s weapons bay, it provide the types with a longer-range arrow to put in their quiver. Bottom line, there are many tactics that can be applied to such a weapon, and that’s an exciting thing to say the least. A long-range, two-stage missile would be especially useful at targeting strategic force multiplying assets, like airborne early warning and control aircraft, tankers, surveillance drones, and communication relay planes. For the Navy’s aircraft carriers, these weapons could give the air wing back its long-range engagement capability that was lost when the AIM-54C Phoenix missile was retired, and later its host platform, the F-14 Tomcat. And striking anti-ship cruise missile carrying bombers is becoming an issue once again with the rise of China’s bomber force and the awakening of the Russian Bear. The possibility of opting for a two stage missile configuration could mean that the DoD plans on skipping an evolutionary step by not moving forward with an air breathing, throttleable ramjet design like the one used on the BMDA Meteor . A two stage system could take better advantage of climbing up into the very thin upper atmosphere where friction and drag are minimized, which would result in longer range and enhanced end-game kinematic performance of the payload weapon. A steeper trajectory and higher speed could also make defending against such an attack more troublesome for the enemy. The U.S. hasn’t led the way in long-range air-to-air missile development over the last decade, at least not publicly or with a new production missile to show for it. Various programs have come and gone over the years, and some seem to continue on to this day, although they are shrouded in secrecy ( Triple Target Terminator for instance), but a clear new long-range or very long-range air-to-air missile strategy has not emerged. Meanwhile America’s peer state competitors, namely China, have moved their air-to-air missile capabilities forward at an alarming rate. Earlier this year, pictures emerged out of China showing what was clearly a very long-range air-to-air missile design being flown on a J-16 indigenous Flanker derivative. You can read all about this missile and our analysis on it here , but suffice it to say, China sees an opportunity in America’s lack of a bigger arrow and the vulnerability of American strategic aircraft during long-range expeditionary operations. Russia also has its own long range missile designs equipped with anti-radiation seekers that could potentially home in on airborne early warning and control aircraft like the E-3 Sentry E-2 Hawkeye. A year ago, images of China’s long-range air-to-air missile emerged, with the missile be flown under a J-16’s wing during a large exercise. , Chinese Internet Now we’ll have to see if the findings of the Long Range Engagement Weapon program result in a development program of record aimed at putting a new missile into production. Once again, this effort may be best paired with taking an existing shorter-ranged missile in development and pairing it with a specialized booster. We have discussed doing exactly that before with Israel’s Stunner surface-to-air missile which features a unique “dolphin” nose seeker head, housing a dual mode seeker installation. Currently Stunner is launched via booster from the ground, but the missile could also potentially fly as a stand-alone weapon on a fighter aircraft or its boosted version could possibly be adapted as well for the long-range air-to-air combat realm. As far as size, a notional LREW missile’s booster could potentially be sized up or down depending on the limitations of the aircraft carrying it. Going with this type of modular route would break the highly restrictive dimensional limitations that entire fighters were designed and built around—most notably the AIM-120’s dimensions for the F-35 and F-22—and would allow much larger future aircraft, like the B-21 Raider, to be able to carry extremely long-range versions of the same basic missile. The booster could also possibly be used for delivering air-to-ground precision strikes over very long ranges. Even the rendering of the LREW concept depicts what looks more like a boosted Excalibur guided artillery round than anything else, although this is likely just used as a placeholder. Still, an air-launched boosted guided artillery round traveling at very high speeds and altitudes for use against both ground targets and aerial ones alike is something to ponder isn’t it? Especially when applied to large strategic sensor aircraft and bomber formations. Whatever the payload weapon is, such a two-stage air-to-air missile concept is truly an exciting possibility, and could result in a common missile design with ranges from intermediate (no booster) to long-range, to very long-range, to extremely long-range with just the change of a booster section. The core missile and its autopilot, data-link, and seeker system could remain largely unchanged. With all this in mind, maybe America’s next generation long-range air-to-air missile will have been worth the wait.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 25, 2018",Watch The Navy Fire Its New Evolved Sea Sparrow Block II Missile For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The NATO Sea Sparrow Consortium is decades old and still going very strong. The highly maneuverable RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) has been protecting allied surface combatants and their escorts for nearly 15 years now around the globe and is seen as a huge success. Before that, the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, itself an adaptation of the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile, had served since the mid 1970s, protecting everything from American supercarriers to allied frigates from airborne threats and short to medium-ranges. Now the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block II is on the way, with its first test firings having occurred last Summer and the Navy just recently released video from these milestone events. The ESSM Block II’s first two test launches occurred aboard the Navy’s test ship, the modified Spruance class destroyer USS Paul F. Foster (DD-964) , last June off the coast of Southern California. Both tests appear to have been successful. The ESSM Block II has much in common with its progenitor, including its ability to be quad-packed into a single Mk41 vertical launch system cell. It can also make use of “legacy” launchers like the Mk29 box launcher that still adorns American supercarriers, amphibious flattops, and other allied vessels. The Block II uses the Block I’s rocket motor and thrust vectoring hot section, but its seeker is much more capable. A RIM-162 ESSM is seen fired from an aircraft carrier’s Mk29 launcher, below are the radar illuminators used to guide the missile to its target, USN Instead of relying on semi-active radar guidance, where one of the ship’s radar illuminators has to “paint” the target for the missile to guide toward and eventually detonate nearby, ESSM Block II features both active and semi-active radar seekers. This dual-mode seeker setup combined with a datalink allows the missile to be fired at targets without ever having the ship illuminate the target at all. The missile gets mid-course updates from the ship via a datalink for longer distance engagements, or it can be launched “fire and forget” for shorter engagements. Fire and forget mode can be used for longer-range shots too, with the missile flying out to its best guess of where the target will be on its own inertial guidance system before turning on its active radar seeker, but the chances of a successful intercept will decrease the farther the missile flies without the benefit of mid-course updates. The physical changes between the Block I and Block II ESSM are minima but the tactical impact that the Block II’s new guidance section will have will be major. Range will likely stay about the same on paper, about 30-45 miles depending on the source, but adjusted flight profiles due to the missile’s new terminal guidance system may allow for longer, more efficient engagements. , USN This dual mode setup solves a huge problem for the ESSM Block I, as ships have limited capacity to defend themselves due to a finite number of illuminators available to guide each individual missile through their separate terminal attacks. Even though ESSMs could be rippled off quickly at many targets, there simply isn’t enough illuminator guidance capacity to support them, even when illuminator time is tightly managed. This is no longer an issue with ESSM Block II, giving ships much greater capacity to defend themselves against a multi-missile swarm attack, and especially ones emanating from different vectors with missiles flying disparate attack profiles. Additionally, the Block II can still leverage the older style of guidance, using the ship’s illuminators to paint the target, which may be advantageous in some instances, and by using both seekers the probability of a kill would likely increase. The original RIM-7 Sea Sparrow Missile served for decades, with it being best known for providing the second to last layer of defense around American flattops. Here you can see one being launched out of the Mk29 box launcher. Note the missile’s folding fins, a major difference between it and its air-launched cousin., USN Also, in a networked battlespace, ESSM Block II can intercept sea skimming anti-ship missiles at greater distances, even when shipborne illuminators, or even radars of any type, are unable to detect or paint the low-flying targets. The ESSM Block II can leverage third party sensor tracks (from another ship, aircraft etc) under the Navy’s cooperative engagement initiatives and fly out towards its target at altitude, and then dive down on it from above, using its own active X-band radar seeker to lock up the target and destroy it. This will be especially useful when opening up the missile’s secondary surface attack functions in littoral environments. All told, RIM-162 ESSM Block II offers a lot of extra capability without having to redevelop the entire missile. And for the US Navy in particular, which fields large amounts of these missiles on its destroyers, cruisers, amphibious flattops, and aircraft carriers, this capability is badly needed. Not just that, but it’s also a real value. The ESSM program is funded cooperatively between the US and allied nations that are part of the consortium. The split is roughly 40% United States and 60% foreign partners. So the US Navy gets an updated ESSM with critical new capabilities for 40% of the cost of developing it alone. Considering the increasing threat of anti-ship missiles that is proliferating among peer state competitors and non-state actors alike , ESSM Block II presents an essential capability that couldn’t come soon enough. The missile is slated to go operational in 2020.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Canada May Buy AIM-120D Missiles That Outrange Its CF-18’s Radar’s Reach,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada’s wish to buy the latest version of the Advanced Medium Range Air-To-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the AIM-120D, has been granted by the US State Department. The only problem is that their current fleet of aging CF-18 Hornets would realize little from the missile’s most preeminent feature, its greatly enhanced range. The cost of Canada’s AIM-120D buy is no chump change. Set at $140M, it buys just 32 AIM-120Ds plus support equipment, captive training rounds, spares, training and so on. The DoD’s press release reads: “The Government of Canada has requested a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the procurement of up to thirty-two (32) AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to Air Missiles (AMRAAMs), up to eighteen (18) AMRAAM Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs); up to four (4) AMRAAM Non-Development Item – Airborne Instrumentation Unit (NDI-AIU); up to two (2) AMRAAM Instrumented Test Vehicles (ITV); up to seven (7) spare AMRAAM guidance units; up to four (4) spare AMRAAM control sections for use on their F/A-18 aircraft.  Included in the sale are containers; storage and preservation; transportation; aircrew and maintenance training; training aids and equipment, spares and repair parts; warranties; weapon system support and test equipment; publications and technical documentation; software development, integration, and support; system integration and testing; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support; and other related elements of logistics and program support.  The estimated total cost is $140 million.” The missile purchase seems to have been intended to coincide with the country’s planned interim purchase of 18 F/A-18 Super Hornets, an initiative that unfortunately has since abandoned due to a major trade dispute between Boeing and Canada’s Bombardier. But considering Canada had officially backed away from the Super Hornet deal nearly two months ago, the fact that the export process continued for the AIM-120D is a bit puzzling. A Canadian Hornet fires an AIM-120C., RCAF Canada could still execute the AIM-120D purchase in an attempt to update their air-to-air missile inventory and add capability to their old Hornets. The RCAF has been flying with the AIM-120C since 2003, when it made an initial order for 97 of the beyond visual range air-to-air missiles. Since dropping their Super Hornet ambitions, Canada has searched for surplus Hornets to supplement their current fleet. They finally decided that Australia was the best, if not the only, source of suitable and readily available legacy F/A-18s. We detailed this move by the Canadian Ministry of Defense in a recent article. Regardless, both the RCAF’s CF-18A/Bs and the RAAF’s F/A-18A/Bs feature the AN/APG-73 multi-mode pulse doppler radar which was received through upgrades over the years , replacing the less capable AN/APG-65. While AN/APG-73 radar set remains capable in terms of mechanically scanned array systems, it does not feature the air-to-air range that can take substantial advantage of the AIM-120D increased reach. Estimates on the AN/APG-73’s range vary, and true performance is dependent on many factors, most notably the target’s radar cross section and aspect in relation to the emitter. But generally, when it comes to fighter-sized targets the AN/APG-73 is thought to have a range of around 35 miles. AN/APG-73 radar on the F/A-18 Hornet., Raytheon The AIM-120D features substantially more range than the AIM-120C7 (I believe the RCAF still uses the C5) without breaking the classic AMRAAM mold line and dimensions. Claims vary as to how far the AIM-120D can reach as official performance numbers are classified, and a missile’s range all depends on the specifics of an engagement and especially the energy and altitude state of the launching aircraft, but some put it upwards of 100 miles, while others say it is more like 75 miles. The missile does feature other enhancements, like an improved two-way data-link system that can support third party targeting. Its navigation system now has embedded GPS, and the missile has better performance in electronic warfare environments, along with a home-on-jam capability which puts aircraft attempting to jam the missile and/or the launch aircraft at greater risk. Other refinements to its electronics make it more durable and adaptable for flying inside the weapons bays of 5th generation fighter aircraft (F-35 and F-22). RCAF You can read more about the AIM-120D and the tactics surrounding its employment in this past War Zone feature . But suffice it to say, the AIM-120D’s advantages relate more to high-end peer state conflicts than the coalition type operations Canada has been a part of since the Hornet’s entry into service in the early 1980s—ones where long beyond visual range shots are usually negated by the need to visually identify the target before firing. In order to take full advantage of the AIM-120D, the fighter carrying it needs a modern Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar set, like the AN/APG-79 found on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and other modern fighters. AESAs feature much farther search and track ranges, enhanced multi-target engagement capability, better performance in electronic warfare environments, and greater target discrimination, especially against low flying small targets like cruise missiles, among many other improvements (simultaneous air-to-ground modes, much better reliability, secondary electronic attack capability etc.). It is uncertain if not unlikely that Canada will upgrade their CF-18s with new radars, even if more are bought from Australia, as a replacement fighter project is on the horizon and will likely be executed sometime in the 2020s. AESA radars are expensive items and Investing millions in each 30 year old airframe for new radars alone is an expensive proposition, but upgrade options do exist. RCAF Both the Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar (RACR) and Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar (RACR) can be adapted to fit the confines of the Hornet’s nose section. SABR has been chosen to equip the F-16V and some Air National Guard F-16s , so there could be sustainment and training synergies between the US and Canada if they were to choose to do away with the AN/APG-73 and replace it with the RACR. But once again, this would require a large investment in aircraft that are supposedly in the twilight of their career with the RCAF. As of now, the CF-18A/B is supposed to stay on till roughly 2025 in CRAF service. If the decision is made to keep the CF-18 flying till 2032 as some have said is a possibility, than more substantial investments in improving their capabilities would be more logical. Such a plan would likely come at the cost of tens of millions per aircraft when you also factor in the structural upgrades needed to prolong the Hornet’s life another 15 years. RCAF A case could be made that that the AIM-120D would help engage bombers, which have large radar signatures, at longer ranges. Considering Russia’s much more aggressive foreign policy and its restart of long-range bomber flights, along with the fact that Canada has a lot of airspace to patrol along the country’s northern frontier, this seems like a valid argument. But the AIM-120D would still likely exceed the AN/APG-73 radar’s capabilities even against large targets, and buying a couple dozen more miles in engagement range against lumbering bombers really isn’t as big of an advantage as it sounds, especially considering Canada flies combat air patrols with limited AIM-120s onboard (usually two with two AIM-9s, but even AIM-7s are still seen loaded out on CF-18s instead of AIM-120s). During a time of conflict this could change of course. There is no doubt that the AIM-120D sports some impressive features, but is it really worth introducing a new missile at the cost of $140M, especially considering the missile’s key feature—it’s enhanced range—largely outpaces the targeting abilities of the Hornet’s own primary sensor, its radar? That’s a question the RCAF will now have to answer.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018","Missiles, Purges, And A Suspicious Crash: A Crazy Weekend In The Saudi Kingdom","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a crazy weekend of events in Saudi Arabia, which has included a missile attack on the heart of the Saudi capital, the arrest of some of The Kingdom’s most powerful men, and even a suspicious helicopter crash near the Saudi Yemeni border. News out of Saudi Arabia has been coming fast and furious over the last 48 hours. It started off with reports of a ballistic missile attack on Riyadh’s King Khaled International Airport on Saturday. The missile, which was launched from inside Yemeni territory, was intercepted by a PAC-3 Patriot surface-to-air missile battery located near the airport. No less than four Patriots were fired at the incoming target, which swatted the ballistic missile out of the sky, with debris falling on one of the runways at the sprawling airport. The missile fired was supposedly a Burkan 2H, which is claimed to have nearly double the range (800-1000km) of the original Burkan missile. Houthi rebels are said to have acquired this capability through their Iranian supporters, and some reports state that the missiles were partially developed with North Korean know-how. Houthi rebels have been lobbing ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia since shortly after the war began. There is no tactical reasoning behind these attacks. Instead they are used like the V2 rocket of World War II—as strategic weapons to bring the pain of war to the Saudi populous and especially Saudi royalty. Over the last two years, Houthi missile technology has steadily increased in capability, with the rebel force first targeting the Saudi capital in early February of 2017 , with follow up attacks occurring in March and May. Other attacks have been centered on the Holy City of Mecca and other locales. Last time the Houthis attacked Riyadh they targeted King Salman Air Base which sits in the center of the Capital. In most cases these missiles were either shot down by Saudi Patriot batteries or they landed in uninhabited areas, but clearly the Houthi rebels’ targeting capabilities are improving. Just hours after the missile attack, some of the most prominent players in Saudi government and business, including billionaire prince Alwaleed bin Talal—one of Saudi Arabia’s most recognizable faces who has large investments in Fox News, Citibank, Four Season Hotels, and Twitter, among many others—along with a slew of other royal power players and high-up government administers were arrested on corruption charges. Alwaleed was an especially vocal critic of the Donald Trump, with the two having exchanged insults on Twitter: What can largely be viewed as a purge against Saudi Arabia’s business and ruling elite occurred as the 80 year old King Salman has moved to consolidate power and set his son, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, up for succession. Mohammad bin Salman ran the Ministry of Defense before becoming crown Prince in June, and also happens to be the person in charge of the recently created Saudi “anti-corruption force.” Included in the arrests was Saudi National Guard chief Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced with a prince with close strategic ties to Salman. The National Guard is a powerful para military apparatus with deep tribal ties within the Kingdom. It is the country’s Pretorian Guard of sorts, primarily tasked with protecting the House of Saud, Mecca and Medina, and the country’s oil infrastructure. Such a force would have been a crucial instrument for executing a coup against King Salman. The 65 year old Miteb bin Abdullah was seen as one of the largest potential rivals for the crown. Crown Prince Muhammad Salman with President Donald Trump., AP The idea of corruption and the concept of Saudi Arabia’s government and leadership architecture go hand-in-hand. You can read a good synopsis on how the Saudis rule, and how they have more in common with an organized crime syndicate than with a modern state, in this excellent piece by Sarah Chayes and Alex De Waal, and there are plenty of other in-depth studies on the subject available as well. Seeing as King Salman has been pushing some fairly large and culturally impactful reforms, arresting many Saudi elites is likely more about consolidating power, eliminating potential usurpers, and guaranteeing the security of his own regime than about ending systemic corruption in a country literally built on corruption. Prince Alwaleed with Bill Gates. Alwaleed, one of the world’s richest men, is probably the most visible Saudi face to the west., AP Then just hours ago, a Saudi UH-60 Black Hawk carrying eight Saudi power players, including Prince Mansour Bin Muqrin , crashed near the southwestern Saudi border with Yemen, killing all onboard. To call the crash suspicious in understandable. Muqrin was a deputy governor of a Saudi province and helped oversee some of of Saudi Arabia’s most holy sites, among managing other projects, but his family affiliation is of special interest. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4-T8qO63d8I Mansur bin Muqrin is the son of Muqrin Bin Abdulaziz. The father had a storied career largely free of accusations over corruption, which included running the Al Mukhabarat Al A’amah (Saudi Intelligence Agency) from 2005 to 2012, and later holding some of the most powerful positions in the Kingdom and being a close confidant of King Abdullah during his reign. This culminated in being named crown prince of Saudi Arabia briefly, from January to April of 2015, following the death of King Abdullah. He was quickly unseated as the first in line for succession by the then newly crowned King Salman, a position King Salman’s son now holds. It remains unclear what the relationship was like between either Mansur Bin Muqrin or his father and the ruling family at the time the helicopter went down. But on a weekend of purges, the incident is somewhat suspicious. The helicopter was supposedly on a tour of project sites when it went crashed. Mansur Bin Muqrin’s father was a highly experienced aviator and was briefly the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, meaning he was the designated successor to the crown, before Salman was made king. , Saudi government via al Arabiya. Considering Salman’s ambitious reform agenda, which is largely being headed up by the 32 year old crown prince, and includes liberalization of state enforced cultural norms, such as allowing women to drive and a more open posture to foreign visitors, as well as major cuts to state spending and a selloff of government assets, the arrests and power consolidation could be aimed at staving off a future coup attempt. While Saudi youth have embraced these changes, it is no secret that these initiatives have enraged many within the Saudi elite caste for all types of reasons, and unusual alliances based on disparate grievances are certainly not uncommon in the region. Salman’s reforms may sound fairly small, but considering how slow the ship of Saudi government changes course, they are viewed as downright radical by many traditionalists. Maybe more troubling for this group is that these changes are just the start of what some say will be a number of much bolder reforms that will occur over the coming decade—that is if Salman and his son get their way. And considering that the Saudi Kingdom runs on exchanging guaranteed wealth for obedience among the royal and ruling class, major fissures among its membership could be seen as a sign of looming instability on the horizon. The Crown Prince headed the Defense Ministry before being named heir. He is largely seen as the architect of Saudi Arabia’s military campaign in Yemen and is the driving force behind many of King Salman’s reforms., AP It’s worth noting that Jared Kushner made a sudden and unannounced visit to Saudi Arabia last week. Politico describes the trip as such: “The White House official would not say who Kushner met with in Saudi Arabia. But he has cultivated a relationship with the crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, who, like Kushner, is in his 30s. Kushner arrived back in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night in time for a surprise birthday dinner for his wife, Ivanka Trump, at the Trump International Hotel. “The Senior Advisor to the President, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, and the Special Representative for International Negotiations recently returned from Saudi Arabia,” the White House official said in a statement to POLITICO.” It remains unclear if the White House knew about the looming power play and/or if they approved of it. The Trump administration has a very tight relationship with The Kingdom, with President Trump making his first foreign stop of his presidency there and agreeing to sell the country a massive weapons package with a price tag approaching 100 billion dollars. Considering Kushner’s close ties with the crown prince, it’s logical that the White House would have an interest in seeing him become king, or at least in keeping his father in power. Egyptian President El Sisi, King Salman, and Donald Trump in the now famous or handling photo., AP With all this in mind, and considering King Salman is 80, it could be possible that he intends to pass his crown to his son in the not so distant future. In order to do so reliably, the step taken over the weekend make sense, but they could also backfire. Ruling the Saudi elite with an iron fist instead of the promise of great wealth represents a massive shift in the Kingdom’s political apparatus, and it could result in just more instability and royal infighting, and that instability could have major consequences on the region as a whole. We’ll have to wait and see how this pans out, but if anything, this weekends series of events stands a stark reminder that Saudi Arabia, even with all its wealth and military might , is far less stable than many would care to imagine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Take A Rare Peek Inside China’s Expansive Joint Battle Command Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We at the The War Zone take a high interest in anything related to strategic command and control , especially when it comes to America’s potential adversaries. We have seen inside Russia’s massive command centers housed in the remodeled Ministry of Defense building in Moscow and now, thanks to newly released video, we get our best look into the Chinese Military Commission’s Joint Battle Center. The center was supposedly established around 2014-2015 as part of a series of reforms aimed at making the Chinese military more capable of unified operations and to facilitate more streamlined command and control at the highest rungs of China’s leadership. Sitting atop that command structure is President Xi Jinping, who is not only the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, but also the chairman of the Chinese Military Commission. Recently he has also adopted the name “Commander In Chief,” emulating the moniker assigned to American Presidents and has continued executing a series of consolidation of power plays that have given him tighter control over the military and less competition among China’s political leadership. Xi Jinping, China’s “Command In Chief,” presides from his special desk at the center of the Joint Battle Command Center, Youtube Screengrab We have seen glimpses of the command center before, most notably in early 2016 (top video) when a fatigue-clad Xi Jinping visited the facility. The most recent video, posted just days ago on November 3rd, 2017, gives us a less redacted, wider and more complete view of the installation (bottom video). The command center is replete with rows of work stations, lots flat screen displays and plenty of red phones, not to mention a special throne-like desk for Xi Jinping. A huge map display system in located in the center of the room. It is unclear exactly what the capability of this map is or how it is really meant to be viewed. Logically it would be a situational map of the region, where the locations of units, ships and vessels could be displayed and particular areas could be zoomed in upon, but then again it could just be a big ass map in an awkward position. The whole place has something of a “set piece” or staged feel to it, similar to Russia’s largest command center that was built around the same time. During Xi Jinping’s recent visit to the facility, he stressed readiness and improving the military’s combat capability as well as the ability for the CMC to fight and win wars—pretty boilerplate stuff—but he also teleconferenced with deployed units, including troops stationed at China’s new base in Djibouti which itself is more than meets the eye . The Horn of Africa outpost largely represents China’s future military ambitions, which have morphed from regional to global in scale . Youtube Screengrab Who knows how effective this elaborate facility actually would be during a time of conflict, but maybe that’s not the point.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 11, 2017",Document Confirms B-21 To Be Delivered Optionally Manned And Nuclear Capable,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USAF has kept the details surrounding their new Long-Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B), now known as the B-21 Raider , tightly under wraps even two years after the contract to build the stealth jet was officially awarded to Northrop Grumman. Often times reports on the aircraft’s basic capabilities are contradicting, and we can only speculate as to the possible cutting edge technologies being integrated into the design —ones that will be needed to keep the aircraft relevant over many decades of service. Now, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, The War Zone has received documentation that can put speculation to rest over two of the aircraft’s most prominent features. We received document DODIG-2015-170 , “Audit of the Acquisition of the Long Range Strike Bomber,” dated September 8th, 2015, as well as other documents in a heavily redacted form, but amongst the sea of black are two highly relevant official confirmations as to the aircraft’s baseline requirements. The document clearly states that the LRS-B will indeed be optionally manned as a core requirement. FOIA document The requirement for unmanned operations is reiterated again by a directive letter from the Secretary of Defense that is also included in the FOIA documents. It reads: “I direct the Air Force to develop an acquisition program that delivers a survivable long range penetrating bomber capable of manned and unmanned operations where range, payload, and survivability are balanced with production cost to provide an…” FOIA documents With the LRS-B’s core design requirements largely frozen since early in the decade, it would seem that this is the clearest proof yet that the aircraft will be built from the outset for optionally manned operations. This has been something of a debatable topic in recent years, with various reports stating that the aircraft will not have unmanned capabilities until possibly far later on in its service life, to essays about why the aircraft should have an unmanned capability from day one. According to this audit, the aircraft is being designed around an unmanned capability, which indicates it will be capable of unmanned operations far earlier in its career. The USAF could choose not to take advantage of this capability initially, but an unmanned LRS-B is a highly attractive proposition. In fact its more attractive now than it was years before. The LRS-B, now the B-21 Raider, will be much more than a bomber. That designation is probably viewed best as more of a function of heritage than anything else. Beyond its deep strike role, the B-21 will be a multi-functional intelligence gathering and networking platform. And due to what is very likely to be its high operating altitude , its ability to execute non-kinetic functions will probably become as important as anything else. The USAF is already looking at moving away from traditional manned discreet intelligence gathering platforms to unmanned systems that can do multiple things in a more persistent manner, and in higher risk environments than their manned counterparts. The JSTARs replacement program is a prime example of this, where the flying service is now stepping away from a manned, more traditional solution and looking towards unmanned aircraft and modular tactical options to fulfill its mission set. A high-flying optionally manned B-21, which will be equipped with powerful sensors, including high fidelity and long-range radar systems, advanced communications, and myriad electronic intelligence gathering capabilities, would be able to penetrate into an enemy’s anti-access “bubble” to garner information on their ground and sea movements. A manned solution, like one based around a business jet platform or airliner, or even an unstealthy high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft like the RQ-4 Global Hawk, would be relegated to standoff surveillance duties which may keep their sensors out of the effective range of their target area altogether. Aspects of Northrop Grumman’s work and experience on developing secretive high-altitude stealthy drones, namely the so called RQ-180 that has supposedly been flying for the better part of a decade now, is surely being rolled into the B-21 design. As such, the USAF is likely trying to kill multiple birds with a single stone by mass producing the B-21 with similar unmanned surveillance capabilities in addition to its manned strike role and nuclear attack roles. The ability to loiter above tactical assets operating below, and for very long periods of time, is likely also critical to B-21’s networking mission. It would offer data fusion and rebroadcasting abilities for stealth assets, like F-22s and F-35s, and especially unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVS) , drastically increasing each platforms’ situational awareness, battlefield cooperation abilities, and the ability for operators and commanders to monitor and control the forward battle space from thousands of miles away. We discussed this capability in a past feature regarding the B-21’s high altitude design, stating: “It also means the B-21 will be able to loiter above the tactical aircraft air combat environment below. As such it could act as a communications and data link connectivity node, sucking up information from the F-35’s, F-22’s, and one unmanned combat air vehicle’s proprietary and stealthy data links. It can then connect these aircraft below by rebroadcasting updates of a “fused” common battlefield picture on each of their individual waveforms. They could also convey the battlefield information from stealthy assets below up to satellites above where it can be pushed around the theater and beyond for real time exploitation. In essence, this will allow the B-21 to act in a similar role as a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) for stealthy assets whose sensor information will be among the most critical as these assets will be deployed the farthest forward over the battlefield. This concept, which has been cryptically touted in multiple organizational concept charts in recent years, solves a number of problems and fits in with two high priority USAF initiatives. Those include focusing on networks and information sharing, as well as morphing from a platform-centric fires and intelligence gathering strategy to a “distributed” one.” Lockheed Martin The nice thing about having an optionally manned multi-role platform for these tasks is that testing and early mission capability can be conducted with a crew in the cockpit, before turning over those missions to the unmanned concept of operations. This equates to less risk early on and a quicker developmental timelines as unmanned aircraft capability usually pays off in the back half of an aircraft’s testing/developmental curve. In other words, it is easier to get the capability into the field rapidly with pilots in the cockpit, and then transitioning to unmanned operations for the same missions once testing has occurred and various systems have been troubleshot and proven mission effective. Another part of the B-21 program where there has been much speculation is on the aircraft’s nuclear mission. The answer as to when or even if the aircraft will have this capability seems to be different depending on who you ask. The FOIA documents clearly lay out the requirements for the nuclear mission and its activation timeline, stating: “Nuclear Capability. According to the acquisition strategy, the baseline capability will include all hardware and software necessary to make the LRS-B capable of carrying (i.e. loading, carrying, releasing, initializing, authorizing, and pre-arming) the B61-12 nuclear weapon.” FOIA Documents The document goes on to detail exactly when the LRS-B will be required to field these capabilities: “Secretary of Defense Requirements. Additionally, in the FY 2013 Nation Defense Authorization Act, Congress mandated that the LRS-B be: -Capable of carrying nuclear weapons at initiation operating capability; and -Certified to employ nuclear weapons two years after initial operating capability. Nuclear certification activities will occur in a follow-on increment.” FOIA Dcuments So once again, according to these documents, the B-21 is being built and will be delivered with full nuclear capabilities and within two years of initial operating capability it will be certified to use that capability operationally. In other words, operational testing, training, and tactics development will be what holds the B-21 back from being nuclear capable on day one of IOC. But two years is pretty quick in terms of modern advanced aircraft development timelines. So at the very least these documents clean up the record on two of the B-21’s primary capability sets. And considering how few details we have on America’s next stealthy strategic weapons and sensor platform, that’s a good thing. It would be nice to see the USAF will begin releasing more details about their new bomber in the near term. The lack of public information is seen in retrospect as a contributing factor that led the early doom of the B-2 Spirit’s production line. Although the need to do so seems to be less pressing now that Donald Trump is in office. His administration has taken up “rebuilding” the armed services as a key policy pillar, with a special emphasis on revamping America’s nuclear capabilities . Still, key congressional figures, including Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Senator John McCain, have been very critical of the USAF’s unwillingness to open the program up to more scrutiny. During a hearing with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein in June of 2017, this particularly heated exchange occurred: “It’s understandable to keep the B-21 specific warfighting capabilities classified, but it’s difficult to understand why you should keep other aspects of the program under the veil of secrecy… Don’t the American people deserve to understand more about what their dollars are being spent, such as $2 billion in RND money requested in this year’s budget?… Wilson replied: “Senator, we are very open with the appropriate committees and the Congress about exactly what we’re doing and what we’re spending it on…” McCain swatted down her claim: “That’s not true, Madame Secretary. That is simply not true. The American people need to know if what’s going to spend $2 billion on what, an R&D? Does the Air Force plan on releasing any further details on the program? If so, when will you do so?” He didn’t get a clear answer back, with the two Pentagon leaders saying that they require 100 B-21s and a total force of 165 bombers. But in March of 2017, Defensetech.org reported that Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the USAF’s attache to the Assistant Secretary of Acquisition at the DoD stated the following: “With where we’re at today, I don’t see releasing anymore details for a period of time. We’ve been very open so far…It’s a balance of transparency so that people understand what we’re trying to do with making sure we don’t release too much information so that potential adversaries could get an advantage.” With this in mind, and seeing how tight lipped the top Air Force brass are even towards the SASC Chairman about their new stealth jet, I wouldn’t bet on an avalanche of new information relating to the B-21 program anytime soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Check Out The B-2 Stealth Bomber’s First Visit To Edwards AFB’s Massive Anechoic Chamber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-2A Spirit , the world’s only operational stealth bomber , has made its first visit to Edwards AFB’s giant Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) this week. We have talked a bit about the sprawling and wildly elaborate infrastructure that supports America’s weapons development programs lately, including how some of these sites look more like something out of Close Encounters of The Third Kind than real life, and the BAF certainly fits this bill. The War Zone did a short profile on the BAF when the B-1B was rolled inside its electromagnetically silent interior for a series of tests in the summer of 2016, in it we described the facility and its mission as such: “The BAF was actually designed during the Reagan era, primarily to support the B-1 and its faltering electronic self-defense suite. Since then, it has serviced aircraft from around the globe. The facility is even named after Rockwell chief test pilot Tommie “Doug” Benefield, who perished on August 29th, 1984, in a crash of a B-1A—the faster Carter-era progenitor of the B-1B. The DoD has many unique and elaborate soundstage-like testing facilities. Some develop missile seekers , others test airplanes and other equipment under extreme temperatures . Even Edwards AFB’s BAF is just one of multiple anechoic chambers available for military testing, although its massive size, able to accommodate any aircraft in the Pentagon’s inventory, makes it unique. The other-worldly interior of the BAF is described by the USAF: “The chamber is filled with polyurethane and polyethylene pyramids, radar absorbing material designed to stop reflections of electromagnetic waves. The size of the pyramids, which are painted dark blue or black, varies depending on the particular frequency and test procedure being conducted. Aircraft systems can be tested and verified that they work properly prior to actual flight test. A big part of the tests that BAF and other anechoic chambers do regards how the aircraft’s electronic systems and emissions interact with one another, and with those from the outside world. For aircraft with advanced electronic warfare suites, like the B-1B or the EA-18G, getting the aircraft to not jam itself can be a major undertaking.” B-2A being rolled into the giant BAF. The facility is big enough to accept any aircraft in the Pentagon’s portfolio., U.S. Air Force photo by Christopher Okula The B-2’s visit to the BAF is supposedly for environmental control checks as the facility’s staff spent a year installing upgrades to accommodate the B-2’s unique needs. According to an Edwards AFB press release, the flying wing bomber will be visiting the chamber again in the future for “electronic warfare testing.” The B-2 continues to receive a series of planned upgrades, including those to its avionics, communications, and sensor systems—namely to the aircraft’s AN/APQ-181 low-probability of intercept (LPI) radar, which features two massive arrays. Originally these were passive electronically scanned arrays (PESAs), but under the B-2’s upgrade roadmap, they are replaced with much more capable active electronically scanned array (AESA) sets. This gives them a host of advantages in terms of range, fidelity, and quick scanning ability, and also likely gives them a secondary electronic warfare and communications capability as well. The original radar system operated on the narrow Ku band, the same as modern airborne satellite communications systems that the Defense Department and the commercial industry like to use. The new radars still operate in the wider J band, of which the Ku band represents the very top of, but they are likely better de-conflicted with these communications systems. The interaction of various electronic systems installed on an aircraft is exactly the type of thing the BAF was built to identify and quantify. Other upgrades to the B-2, such as to its Defensive Management System , will also have to be tested for negative interactions and anomalies caused by the aircraft’s other systems. An F-16 looks like a small toy inside the giant BAF. People have told me that it is so silent inside that it is almost distracting and takes some getting use to. “You hear your own body’s mechanics in surround sound” as one individual who has experience in these types of facilities put it., USAF What isn’t clear is exactly why the B-2 hasn’t needed the BAF’s services in the past as the aircraft has been flying for nearly 30 years, and in operational service for 20 years. Regardless, it’s possible that the BAF has been upgraded to support the B-2 because it will also have to support the B-21 Raider in the not so distant future. Either way, the B-2 now has one of the USAF’s best developmental resources behind it, which is a good thing as the fleet of 20 Spirits is slated to serve into the next half of the century.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America’s oldest active aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) is currently sailing in the Pacific region where she will soon join two other American supercarriers and their strike groups for a massive training evolution and show of force. But beneath the headlines is the reality that in order to make such a grand display of American might happen, everyone has to do their job. For the Nimitz this means each of her 5,500 sailors needs to do their part in keeping the 45 year old, 100,000 ton ship for action. When thinking of an aircraft carrier’s crew its air wing personnel, deck crew, and “island dwellers” usually come first to mind, but keeping a small floating fortress city humming along takes an army of workers who have far less glamorous jobs which largely go unrecognized . The Nimitz’s Executive Officer, Commander J.W. David Kurtz , a Naval Flight Officer with a background in electronic warfare and the EA-6Bs and E/A-18Gs, along with the carrier’s media department, are doing something creative about this by creating their own version of Mike Rowe’s cult classic  reality television show Dirty Jobs. USS Nimitz traverses the Arabian Sea on October 1st. The ship is now located in the 7th Fleet area of operations., USS Nimitz Facebook page So far there have been seven episodes of the homemade—or should I say ship-made—show—the better part of a season in today’s truncated television production runs—and they keep getting better with every episode.  Not only is it fun to see one of the carrier’s head honchos getting down and dirty deep below decks with the lower ranks, but it also gives us a great view inside the workings of a modern supercarrier. The XO has done everything from climbing the carrier’s island to clean communications arrays, to grinding welds on the ship’s steam catapult piping, to servicing a weapons elevator with some nasty chemicals. So on this Veterans Day, give a little appreciation to the little guys that work so damn hard making America’s most powerful war machines tick by checking out some episodes of Nimitz Dirty Jobs : A big thanks to our good friend and contributor Joe “Smokin” Ruzicka for the heads up on the videos.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 21, 2017",The Navy’s Rationale For Not Reactivating Perry Class Frigates Doesn’t Float,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An internal Navy memo recommends that the ten remaining Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates shouldn’t be returned to service due to cost considerations and other priorities. Moving forward with the initiative would supposedly cost the Navy $4.32B over ten years, which includes restoring and operating the regenerated Perry class fleet, or roughly $432M per ship. The seven hulls that are in the best condition would cost the Navy $3B over the same amount of time. The move to return the Perry class frigates the Navy still has, as dozens have been sold off to allies or sunk for training purposes , comes as the seafaring force struggles to figure out ways to obtain its goal of maintaining a 355 ship Navy in the coming decades. The idea was that at least seven Perry class frigates sitting in mothballs would be able to be returned to service, and at the very least they could do so with minimal upgrades and take on the lower-end, lower threat environment missions such as drug and smuggling interdiction and possibly anti-piracy operations. These missions have to be fulfilled by higher-end surface combatants today which would be far better utilized executing more demanding tasks. USN At first glance that $432M figure seems troubling, but when you dig deeper, it actually represents a real value for the Navy. According to the Congressional Research Office’s October 3rd, 2017 report on the Littoral Combat Ship program, the unit acquisition cost per vessel along with just a single mission package averages a combined $658.2M: Sea Frames: The Navy’s proposed FY2018 budget, as amended on May 24, 2017, is requesting the procurement of two LCSs at a combined cost of $1,177.1 million, or an average of about $588.6 million each. Certain LCS sea frames that were procured in prior years were subject to an LCS program unit procurement cost cap. Mission Packages: A March 2017 GAO report states that the total estimated acquisition cost of 64 LCS mission packages is $7,100.7 million (i.e., about $7.1 billion) in constant FY2017 dollars (an average of about $110.9 million per package), including $2,611.6 million (i.e., about $2.6 billion) in research and development costs and $4,456.3 million (i.e., about $4.5 billion) in procurement costs (an average of about $69.6 each in procurement cost). Once again, at first glance the $658.2M per Littoral Combat Ship number seems like a fairly good deal over the Perry class frigate’s regeneration costs, but remember, the Perry class ship cost of $432M is not just for regenerating it back to the fleet but also for operating it for a decade. In a 2014 report on the LCS program by the General Accountability Office (GAO), the annual estimated cost of operation for the Navy’s surface combatants are clearly displayed. The Perry class frigate cost $54M per year to operate. Although that number would likely be drastically reduced largely because the regenerated Perry class ship would be used for simple missions, and would not require the investment in training, manning, or even keeping many of its combat system online for their reduced role. They would also likely stay close to home, and would not deploy for long stretches as part of a carrier strike group. We don’t know what this new figure would but we can guess based on available information. USN Admiral Richardson, the current Chief of Naval Operations, has said that he has seen Perry class frigates returned to service by allies for extremely small sums of money. As we stated in a previous report on the issue: …Under the plan that SECNAV Spencer is talking about, these ships wouldn’t get any combat system upgrades at all. Instead they would be seaworthy and navigation ready only. USNI News reports Spencer mentioned that other navies have gotten retired Perry class frigates back out to sea for as little as $35,000, which is about one sixth the price of a full tank of gas for the type. With no combat system upgrades, a reintroduced Perry class would primarily be tasked with supporting the highly controversial war on drugs—sailing in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to interdict contraband shipments. Basically they would work as counter-narcotics platforms for operations in very low threat environments. In doing so, the plan would relieve higher-end assets of the mission, including Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Littoral Combat Ships. Spencer stated the following regarding bringing back what’s left of the Perry class: “Is a DDG the thing to put for drug interdictions down in the Caribbean? I don’t think so… Do we actually have something in the portfolio right now? One of the things we might look at is bringing the Perry class to do a limited drug interdiction mode… No combat systems, but sea-ready, navigation ready, radar ready out the door… That’s a pretty inexpensive proven platform right there…Can you arm it up with Tomahawks? No.” The nice thing about turning the last of the Perry class frigates into an adaptable low-cost “platforms” of sorts is that you can leverage how well built these ships are and take advantage of more of their service life while bolting on modular systems as needed. Specialized personnel would only have to be deployed to operate certain systems when needed. Helicopters and drones can make use of the ship’s flight deck and hangar spaces, and overall you get a ship that is only as capable as you need it to be, and fairly affordable to operate as well. The Navy’s afloat forward staging base USS Ponce was put to use around a similar concept and was highly successful in doing so. USN So instead of the $35,000 figure Richardson highlights, let’s just be generous and say it will cost $32M per ship to regenerate them in so called “navigation and radar ready” form. That leaves $400M for operations over 10 years, or $40M per year. Now take the LCS, which is fulfilling counter narcotics missions today (even worse, Arleigh Burke class destroyers are being wasted on this type of tasking), and according to the GAO report the Navy spends $64M per year operating each vessel, and another $15M to keep up its mission modules. In total that equals $79M per year per LCS. A destroyer isn’t all that much more expensive at $88M per year. And LCS operational costs are unlikely to have gone down drastically over the last couple of years as the program has been restructured with more manpower, training, and ship enhancements. So an LCS’s cost of acquisition and operation over a decade is $1.45B. That is 3.35 times the cost of the regenerated Oliver Hazard Perry class ships, and this is for all ten frigates, not just the best seven of the bunch. If just seven were regenerated, that cost would drop. Yes the LCS has more capabilities than regenerated Perry class ships would, but once again, for the counter-narcotics and other mundane missions the Navy is going to execute one way or another, their capabilities are excessive. Freedom class LCS, USN What all this shows is that the Navy is playing number games in an attempt to not have to sacrifice a penny for the new toys it wants even if polishing up the old toys it already owns is an outstanding financial opportunity, which it clearly is. And, according to Defense News , the Navy pretty much says exactly that in their memo—they don’t want to invest a dime into these ships if it means sacrificing any existing procurement programs funds, including the failed LCS: “…Absent any external source of funding, these costs would likely come at the expense of other readiness, modernization or shipbuilding programs… Funding for [frigate] reactivation should not come at the expense of Cruiser and Destroyer modernization, Littoral Combat Ship procurement, and FFG(X) procurement… If additional funding were made available, recommend funding the service life extension of Cruisers before funding FFG-7 reactivation as Cruisers would not require additional combat systems modernization and would provide much greater warfighting capability.” The last of the Perry class FFGs in USN service, the USS Simpson, was retired just a couple years ago in 2015. , USN The Navy is also playing somewhat of a capabilities and mission set shell game in this memo. The idea is not to create a high-end surface combatant out of the surviving Perry class ships, but to free up higher-end surface combatants for more challenging missions that could be done by far more cost effective Perry class frigates. The fact that the Navy even brings up modernizing its cruiser fleet as a priority over regenerating a handful of Perry class frigates for very little money is laughable. In the end they are basically telling congress if they want to pay for it, have at it, but we don’t want to make it priority no matter how much sense it makes. This is sadly unsurprising but it is troubling as far more expensive Littoral Combat Ships and destroyers will continue executing these missions when an incredibly cheap alternative is sitting silent on the Navy’s own piers. In the end shipbuilding and all its politics and special interest influences that go along with, as well as the Pentagon leadership’s obsession with new shiny objects, always wins out, even as our allies have shown us how capable and cost effective our old Perry class throwaways can be. In the meantime the Navy will continue to complain that it doesn’t have enough ships to meet its requirements and how it needs 355 hulls, while its Littoral Combat Ships, which aren’t all that cheap at all it turns out, and its multi-billion dollar destroyers are being used to catch guys in tiny speedboats carrying bundles of pot and cocaine. So U.S. Navy, after years of bad procurement decisions , let logic prevail for once and bring back the Perry class. It’s the right thing to do. And enough with the loaded and misleading statements that don’t even attempt to compare apples to apples when making a force structure and procurement case on fiscal grounds, because clearly it doesn’t have one here.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Photos have emerged of an heavily wrapped F-117 fuselage being hauled on a flatbed truck. The sighting occurred yesterday, near Creech AFB, alongside the Veterans Memorial Highway (U.S. Route 95). The highway directly connects Tonopah and Las Vegas. Tonopah Test Range Airport is where the F-117 program lived during its near decade-long period of secret seclusion , and where the aircraft have since returned for their post official retirement phase of their lives. The airframe appears to be in a similar state as how most of the F-117s are stored at Tonopah, with their wing sections removed, and in this case, the aircraft’s twin “v” tails appear to be absent as well. Both sections are likely stored under the aircraft for transport. Courtesy of Randy and Brett Courtesy of Randy and Brett Although we can’t say with absolute certainty where the aircraft is headed, we can speculate with confidence that this will be its final voyage. I n accordance with last year’s Pentagon budget, the F-117 fleet is now slowly being taken off Type-1000 reserve storage status and permanently retired of—a process that will take over a decade to finish. The F-117s may end up at the Pentagon’s boneyard (AMARG) adjacent to Davis Monthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona or they could be destroyed, it isn’t clear at this time. Four aircraft per year will pulled from Tonopah to be permanently retired or disposed of under the plan. F-117s stored in the “canyon” hangars at Tonopah Test Range Airport. , USAF The F-117’s airframe was sensitive enough at the time of their retirement from front-line service a decade ago to necessitate their storage in climate controlled hangars at Tonopah Test Range Airport, and by the photos released of the aircraft entombed in their hangars at the secretive base, they still were adorned with radar absorbent material. Although the coatings are likely dated by now , they still may pose a security and even a health risk . As such, any aircraft that will be put to pasture, cut up, or possibly sent to a museum, would require some serious work. It’s possible this work is being done at AMARG or possibly by Lockheed at Plant 42 or at another site before the jet continues on to its final resting place. It is worth noting that Lockheed and the USAF destroyed a developmental F-117 airframe (Article #784) around the time of the type’s official retirement due to the lack of a place to store it and as a test as to how to dispose of the jets. Since then rumors have circulated that some of the “Black Jets” have been ripped apart and buried at Tonopah Test Range Airport as well. 2008 ACC History/Official USAF documents 2008 ACC History/Official USAF documents USAF With all this in mind, it isn’t likely the last time we will see an F-117 being trucked south like this one, which represents a bitter-sweet end to such an iconic piece of American ingenuity. But at the same time the fact that the F-117, a tiny handful of which were still flying as late as 2016, requires this level of care just to meet its final end is a testament to just how far ahead of its time the airframe was when it first took to the skies. And with the F-35A coming online, finally replacing the F-117’s 2,000lb class precision weapons delivery capability in a stealthy tactical package, and who knows what else exists in the classified world, the Nighthawk’s legendary career is about to become a prominent page in the annals of aviation and warfare history.

Local news outlets are reporting that pilots from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island—the home of the Navy’s fleet of EA-18G Growlers , as well as larger maritime patrol aircraft—drew a massive male genitalia in the sky with their contrails. The phallic sky art occurred near the town of Omak, which is located in north-central Washington, on the western edge of the Colville Indian Reservation. The area lays under the expansive Okanagan Military Operating Area (MOA). This restricted airspace is used regularly by Growler crews from NAS Whidbey Island and by other military pilots visiting the area for training purposes. VFR sectional chart KREM 2 (more pictures at the link), a local CBS affiliate out of Spokane, said a local mother took pictures of the wind-borne wiener and complained to the station that it was inappropriate and that she doesn’t want to have to explain it to her children. The good folks over at KREM 2 News inquired about the racy sky art with the Navy, and got the following response: “The Navy holds its aircrew to the highest standards and we find this absolutely unacceptable, of zero training value and we are holding the crew accountable.” The FAA told the station that there was nothing they could do unless there was a safety risk and that they “couldn’t police morality.” It’s not like this type of controversy hasn’t happened before ,  but I sure wouldn’t want to be taken out of an EA-18G Growler cockpit and put into a C-130 cockpit “hauling rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong” for this unique aerial display of self expression.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 19, 2017",Frantic Search Underway For Missing Argentine Submarine (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Santa Cruz class diesel electric submarine ARA San Juan (S-42) belonging to the Argentine Navy has gone missing. The boat’s last known position was sent on November 15th, 2017 from roughly 240 miles off the Gulfo San Jorge, or about 920 miles from Buenos Aires. The vessel had been transiting from a naval base in Argentina’s southern littoral reaches, on the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, to the city of Mar del Plate, which is over a thousand miles to the north. 44 sailors are said to be onboard and an air and sea search is currently underway to locate the submarine. Enrique Balbi, an Argentine Navy spokesman, told reporters : “The submarine knows that if it does not have communication with land for this long, it has to surface.” Bad weather conditions are supposedly hampering search efforts, which are likely to grow in scope to an international affair in the coming hours. The 216 foot long Santa Cruz class is made up of two TR-1700 class submarines imported from Germany in the mid 1980s. At the time they were the largest submarines Germany had constructed since the end of WWII, displacing 2,265 tons. ARA San Juan , Martin Otero/wikicommons These attack boats are particularly fast for diesel electric submarines of their size and era, being able to hit 25 knots. They are also designed for long-endurance patrols, and run missions that last over four weeks, which can be extended up to eight weeks if required. Both boats have seen major upgrades in the last decade, with the San Juan coming out of refit just four years ago. Originally, six of the class were going to be procured, but this was cut to just two due to the country’s economic turmoil of the late 1980s. The final four boats of the class were to be license-built by Astillero Domecq Garcia in Argentina, with the ARA Sante Fe being largely completed when the order to stop work was received. Although the submarine was largely picked over for parts to keep her two operational sister ships running, there is talk that Argentina could complete its construction, bolstering the country’s submarine fleet, which only consists of one other smaller Salta class (German Type 209) boat. Of particular importance under the circumstances is that these vessels are configured to accept assistance from a deep sea rescue vehicle should the crew be trapped deep beneath the ocean’s surface. Multiple countries possess DSRV capabilities, with the U.S. being able to quickly deploy its Submarine Rescue Diving Recompression System on short notice by airlifter and can attempt a rescue at depths as deep as 2,000 feet. SRDRS seen during a training evolution., USN There haven’t been any reports of a rescue vehicle being forward deployed just yet, but this could happen as a cautionary measure at any time in hopes that the submarine can be found intact even if it has sunk to the sea floor. We will live update this post over the next 12 hours as more information becomes available. UPDATE 2:55pm PST— There isn’t a whole lot of new news, but there are a couple pieces of information worth adding. First, based on multiple reports the weather around the area of the submarine’s last known position remains poor, hampering the search effort. NASA’s P-3B aircraft used for antarctic surveillance missions—we have detailed the type’s use for this unique role in this past article —is now actively taking part of the search effort. In addition, Argentine Navy vessels, including c orvettes ARA Rosales (P-42) and ARA Drummond (P-31), as well as destroyer ARA Sarandí (D-13) are executing a surface search plan. NASA’s P-3B., NASA We also have confirmation that the U.S. military is working on additional options to assist in the search for the submarine and, just as predicted, to execute a possible submerged rescue operation, including activating the Navy’s undersea rescue capabilities out of San Diego. USNI News states : “SOUTHCOM was in communication with the State Department and preparing options for a response in case a formal request for assistance were made. Outside of the NASA aircraft, the U.S. has not been asked to contribute assets to the search but is preparing specialized submarine rescue equipment in anticipation of a request from Buenos Aries, USNI News has learned. U.S. Navy Undersea Rescue Command is mobilizing the specialized submarine rescue equipment and personnel in San Diego to crew the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS), two defense officials confirmed to USNI News. The system can be transported via cargo aircraft and loaded onto a surface ship for rescue operations.” These options will likely also include the rapid deployment of U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft to the area of interest. The type represents the most capable maritime surveillance asset in the world, one that is especially adept at search and rescue operations and finding surfaced submarines. The aircraft’s jet speed transit capability means that it can be on station and flying missions in just a matter of hours. The British and Chilean governments have also offered to help . A Chilean aircraft equipped with a FLIR system, and thus capable of searching at night, has already been dispatched to Argentina to help in the effort.

The calls, which were made via satellite, came between 10:52am and 3:42pm and lasted from as short as four seconds to as long as 36 seconds. A connection was never made but communications companies from the U.S. are working to try to geolocate the position from where the calls were made. Learn about the ARA San Juan and what it was doing when it went missing by reading our previous post linked here. This revelation comes as a much needed glimmer of hope in what has become an increasingly dire international rescue effort. No contact with the 30 year old diesel electric submarine has been made for over three days and fears have been growing that the vessel sunk while operating below the surface. Though the attempted contacted is seemingly a good sign, there is always a chance that it could be an anomaly or it could have possibly come from a different vessel.

The Navy detailed their undersea rescue deployment plans in a statement, stating in part: “URC is deploying two independent rescue assets based on a number of factors, including the varying depth of ocean waters near South America’s southeastern coast and the differing safe operating depths of the two rescue systems. Three U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III and one U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy aircraft will transport the first rescue system, the Submarine Rescue Chamber (SRC) and underwater intervention Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) from Miramar to Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina. The four aircraft are scheduled to depart Miramar Nov. 18 and arrive in Argentina Nov. 19. The second rescue system, the Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM) and supporting equipment will be transported via additional flights and is scheduled to arrive in Argentina early next week. The SRC is a McCann rescue chamber designed during World War II and still used today. SRC can rescue up to six persons at a time and reach a bottomed submarine at depths of 850 feet. The PRM can submerge up to 2,000 feet for docking and mating, with a submarine settled on the ocean floor up to 45-degree angle in both pitch and roll. The PRM can rescue up to 16 personnel at a time. Both assets are operated by two crewmembers and mate with the submarine by sealing over the submarine’s hatch allowing Sailors to safely transfer to the rescue chamber. The URC Sailors deploying with the rescue systems are highly trained on its use and routinely exercise employing the advanced technology in submarine rescue scenarios.” A growing armada of aircraft and surface vessels are taking part in the search and rescue effort, many of which come from other countries that were looking to help. Chile, Uruguay, Peru and Brazil are providing assets for the cause, and the UK, Argentina’s old foe, was one of the first countries that offered to join the hunt for the San Juan and her 44 sailors, with the country’s polar exploration vessel HMS Protector slated to arrive on the scene within hours. But even with a growing list of assets available, bad weather in some of the areas where the search is being focused has hampered the overall effort. The HMS Protector will bring a wide range of capabilities to the search effort. , Royal Navy/Crown Copywright One of the main search areas seems to be about 150 miles east of the San Juan’s home port of Mar del Plata, in an area where the Atlantic Shelf begins to drop off. If the submarine had traveled east of the shelf and sunk, the depth could complicate both search and rescue efforts, and frankly, it could be catastrophic for the submarine’s hull. Hopefully this isn’t the case and the supposed satellite contact attempts are a good sign that the vessel is surfaced—that is if those transmissions really came from the San Juan .

As you can see below, the search area is absolutely huge. There is also growing talk that the search effort, even four days after the submarine went missing, is largely uncoordinated.

Authorities have mainly been scanning the sea from above as waves of up to 8 meters (26 feet) and winds of up to 40 knots made the search difficult for boats, Gonzalez told reporters. “Unfortunately these conditions are expected to remain for the next 48 hours,” Gonzalez said from the Mar del Plata naval base, about 420 km (240 miles) south of Buenos Aires where the submarine had been heading toward before vanishing.” High seas make finding the submarine especially difficult as it has a very small profile while surfaced and is basically painted to blend in with the sea. Riding out such a storm in that size of submarine while surfaced would be a very uncomfortable, if not dangerous encounter according to one submariner we talked to.

Alternatively, it is possible that it could be a helicopter or even MV-22 Osprey. The USMC has MV-22s based in Okinawa and they have supported the Ronald Reagan in the past. It’s also not unheard of for USMC aircraft to be initially referred to as belonging to the Navy following mishaps. A USMC MV-22 seen on the fantail of the USS Ronald Reagan recently. , USN The Ronald Reagan just completed a highly publicized training evolution with two other American Carrier Strike Groups and a Japanese helicopter carrier and its escorts.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 5, 2018",Take A Very Rare Look Inside The Secretive Tonopah Test Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Located in the northern reaches of the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) , which consists of the Nellis Range Complex, the Department of Energy’s legendary nuclear test site, Area 51, and other secluded areas, is Tonopah Test Range (TTR). The land mass, which covers hundreds of square miles, has been used extensively for testing military technologies, especially those related to aerial nuclear weapons delivery, dating back to the 1960s. But it’s probably best known for nearby Tonopah Test Range Airport, where the F-117 Nighthawk lived in total secrecy during the first decade of its operational service, and the airstrip was also home to foreign MiGs being flown under the highly classified Constant Peg program . Just like its associated air base, the nearby range, which is ran by Sandia Labs, continues to be an active place and has recently received a number of state of the art upgrades which are already being used to support America’s nuclear arsenal modernization initiative as well as other programs. On November 15th, 2017 Sandia Labs released a video that gives rare insight into the range and its capabilities. The video offers up a basic idea of what the range is used for, although other customers also use it and the airspace over it, including major defense contractors, the USAF, and especially Special Operations Command and their fleet of clandestine surveillance and support aircraft. Snow covered desolate Tonopah Test Range., Sandia Labs The description of TTR on Sandia Labs website reads: Tonopah Test Range (TTR) is the testing range of choice for all national security missions. Sandia conducts operations at TTR in support of the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration’s weapons programs. Principal DOE activities at TTR include stockpile reliability testing; arming, fusing, and firing systems testing; and the testing of nuclear weapon delivery systems. The range also offers a unique test environment for use by other U.S. government agencies and their contractors. Located about 160 miles northwest of Las Vegas, TTR is an immense area of flat terrain ideal for rockets and low-altitude, high-speed aircraft operations. Situated between two mountain ranges, TTR’s remote location and restricted airspace ensure that tests can be conducted with a high degree of safety and security. One of the primary facilities at TTR is a large airfield, consisting of a 12,000-foot (3,700-m) runway and numerous hangars. TTR offers a wide array of signal-tracking equipment, including video, high-speed cameras, and radar-tracking devices. This equipment is used to characterize ballistics, aerodynamics, and parachute performance for artillery shells, bomb drops, missiles, and rockets. In recent years, specific test activities at TTR have included the following: Trajectory studies of simulated weapons Air drops Gun firings Ground-launched rockets Air-launched rockets Explosives testing Static rocket tests Ground penetrator tests A rough looking B-2 Spirit drops an inert B61 nuclear bomb during a test over TTR., Sandia Labs What’s most interesting is that even though technology has definitely changed over the last years, Tonopah Test Range’s mission really hasn’t. Check out the recently produced video in comparison to one produced over 50 years ago: With the B61 tactical nuclear bomb (which is heavily featured in the video) being updated , a new stealth bomber with nuclear capability on the way, and a nuclear-tipped long-range air launched cruise missile in the works , not to mention a new ICBM , strategic arsenal related testing at TTR is set to balloon in the coming years. This doesn’t even include conventional weapons and capabilities testing and training. Not to mention what is going on out at Tonopah Test Range Airport beyond the storing of F-117s and supporting known (albeit very shy) test platforms and range assets. Considering the base continues to receive multiple “Janet” flights a day, speculation as to what is going on there in the classified realm is a whole other story entirely.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 30, 2018",Portland’s 142nd Fighter Wing Launches 13 F-15C/Ds Eagles In Rare Snap Readiness Drill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over a dozen F-15C/D Eagles belonging to the 142nd Fighter Wing/123rd Fighter Squadron “Redhawks” lined up for departure at Portland International Airport this morning as part of a short-notice combat readiness drill. The idea behind the exercise was to challenge the wing to generate as many available aircraft as fast as possible in just 24 hours. The goal for the exercise was 12 aircraft, but of course the Redhawks—one of the world’s finest Eagle squadrons—put up 13. The 142nd FW has a total of 21 F-15C/Ds in its inventory. These types of exercises, often referred to as “elephant walks,” are somewhat common at bases abroad, such as at Osan Air Base South Korea and Kadena Air Base in Japan , and at master fighter bases here in the U.S.. But for Air National Guard units that are often based alone at major civilian airports, they are a far rarer happening. In fact, to my knowledge and to that of long-serving personnel with the 142nd Fighter Wing, this type of drill is indeed unprecedented for the unit, at least in the last couple of decades. Three divisions of F-15s overflew PDX before landing, along with a single F-15 that followed the formation. The aircraft flew under Eagle, Pistol, Rage, and Blade callsigns—all of which are often used by the 142nd FW for daily training over the Pacific Northwest.  , Mike Swaja Just hours before the drill occurred, the 142nd FW put out the follow announcement: “The 142nd Fighter Wing is currently conducting a combat readiness exercise until tomorrow afternoon. This exercise tests the wing’s ability to generate air power within roughly 24 hours after being notified. This allows the wing commander to evaluate the wing’s ability to respond with minimal notice and meet or exceed the tasking timelines. The exercise will end after 12 F-15’s take off on the morning of November 22nd.” It remains unclear why the uncommon drill was executed, although the defense posture of American air power has steadily become more rigid since Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Other peer state competitors, like China, not to mention rogue regimes, in particular North Korea, would also be the targeted consumers of such a show of force. It’s worth noting that many Americans still have a distorted view of the Air National Guard’s tactical aircraft units. What once were units with dated gear and second priority funding are now front line squadrons with upgraded aircraft that would likely be deployed if any form of large scale combat operations were launched. This is a product of the shrinking USAF which has just a fraction of the squadrons it had during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the service’s force structure at that time was just a shadow of what it was during Desert Storm. In fact, there are just three active duty F-15C/D squadrons left, all of which are based overseas (Kadena Air Base and RAF Lakenheath) and that number will be pared down further in the not so distant future. APG-63V3 AESA installed in a 142nd FW F-15C., Tyler Rogoway/Author The 142nd FW, which is one of just five F-15 squadrons tasked with homeland air sovereignty along America’s sea borders, has F-15s equipped with the world’s most capable air-to-air radar, the APG-63V3 AESA, and the unit has also recently received Sniper advanced targeting pods. The Sniper ATP is widely used for air-to-ground targeting by aircraft ranging from Canadian CF-18 Hornets to B-52H bombers, but the Air National Guard has adapted the sensor system for long-range visual identification and tracking of aircraft. In this role the pod is primarily used for identifying and surveying aircraft during homeland air defense missions at long ranges and at night, but it can also be used overseas to get beyond-visual-range visual identification of targets before engaging said targets under tight rules of engagement. Roughly 179 Air Guard F-15C/Ds, dubbed “Golden Eagles” are slated to continue to get upgrades in the coming years, including a new electronic warfare system, infrared search and track pods, and even possibly a new glass cockpit. That is if the aircraft aren’t retired in exchange for upgraded F-16s . Originally these “Golden Eagles” were slated to serve well into the 2030s and possibly beyond. A division of Redhawks enter the overhead break for landing at the conclusion of the drill., Mike Swaja Maybe most notably, the 142nd Fighter Wing was recently involved with a highly peculiar incident involving a still unidentified aircraft flying over southern Oregon, a story The War Zone broke last week . Who knows, maybe this sudden drill had something to do with that strange series of events, although that would be unlikely. Regardless, one thing abundantly crystal clear: The Redhawks remain a force to be reckoned with.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 23, 2018",Trump Just Provided More Evidence That He Thinks The F-35 Is Actually Invisible,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Thanksgiving Day, Commander In Chief Donald Trump visited U.S. Coast Guard Lake Worth Inlet Station located nearby his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach where he is vacationing . While there, Trump made a series of meandering remarks, which included touting his administration’s accomplishments and thanking the Coast Guard members for their hard work. At one point his speech strayed into a familiar but chronically erroneous subject matter for the President—the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The President has a long and inconsistent relationship with the F-35 program, which we have documented in detail. He went from being a vocal critic of the program to being one of its biggest cheerleaders, having proclaiming that he alone “fixed it” after negotiating down its price—a claim that is dubious at best . More recently, the President strayed into the F-35 realm when talking about relief efforts with Puerto Rican officials while visiting the storm ravaged island, and just as in this latest instance, for some reason he brought the program up while addressing the U.S. Coast Guard, stating : “Amazing job, and amazing job. So amazing that we’re ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. Do you like the F-35? I said how does it do it in fights, and how do they do in fights with the F-35. He says we do very well, you can’t see it. Literally you can’t see. It’s hard to fight a plane you can’t see right? But that’s an expensive plane you can’t see. And as you probably heard we cut the price very substantially, something other administrations would never have done, that I can tell you.” F-35.com The statement was puzzling, not just because it was astonishingly off topic and inappropriate considering the setting and audience, but it doubled down on previous comments that alluded to the possibility that Trump has a very poor understanding of the aircraft’s capabilities, and may even think the aircraft is actually invisible, not just low observable in terms of its radar return and low-probability of intercept electronic emissions. But what he told the Coasties in Florida on Thursday seems to further underscore the possibility that he does indeed think the controversial jet is invisible: “With the Air Force we’re ordering a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is almost you know like an invisible fighter. I was asking the Air Force guys how good is this plane, and they said ‘well sir you can’t see it,’ I said yeah but in a fight, you know a fight, like I watch on the movies, the fight, they’re fighting, how good is it? ‘Well it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if it’s right next to it, it can’t see it.’ I said that helps, that’s a good thing. But we have equipment that nobody has the equipment that we have. It’s sad when we are selling our equipment to other countries but we’re not buying it ourself ok. But now that’s all changed. And I said the stuff that we have is always a little better too. You know when we sell to other countries, even if they’re allies, you never know about an ally an ally can turn, you’re going to find that out. But I always say make ours a little bit better, give it that extra speed, a little bit—keep a little bit—keep about ten percent in the bag. Because what he have nobody has like we have, and uh that’s what we’re doing.” Trump’s comments on weapons exports are also interesting to say the least, as they show a basic misunderstanding of export controls, including those surrounding the F-35. The F-35s being sold to America’s allies have not been downgraded for export as was rumored for years as the program began to mature. Israel is the only country that will have special ability to alter the F-35’s capabilities for their own needs. In some cases other fighter aircraft and weapon systems are exported with tailored capabilities intended to reduce risk and to help keep U.S. regional policy and balance of power in check. For instance, Iraqi F-16s were not delivered with AIM-120 capability, and Saudi Arabia received their F-15S aircraft with downgraded radar and electronic warfare capabilities. Taiwan is maybe the best example of this, with the Obama administration banning them from buying new F-16s, so instead they had to upgrade their older F-16s to a similar standard. In recent years, 4th generation aircraft like the F-16 and F-15, have been exported in far more potent form than older examples still serving with America’s air arms. But as far as the F-35 goes, a USAF F-35A and one delivered to the Netherlands will have the same capabilities and radar cross-section, that is unless Trump has let slip that this has changed—something international customers won’t be happy about to say the least. Regardless, having ten percent more speed is not a major tactical factor anyways. Saudis received their F-15S jets with downgraded capabilities largely meant to maintain Israel’s qualitative air combat edge in the region. Today the Saudis operate the most advanced F-15 in the world, the F-15SA. , Tyler Rogoway/author The President has seemingly made more incorrect statements about weapon systems and their capabilities than correct ones since being inaugurated , and sometimes these factually wrong declarations have been eschewed during very high-profile and strategically impactful events. Most recently, Trump incorrectly touted America’s ballistic missile defense capabilities while fielding question with Japanese Prime Minster Abe during a visiting to Japan. The fact is America’s enemies are watching and listening, and seeing a Commander in Chief that is so bombastic about a topic he clearly doesn’t have much understanding of hurts American credibility. His almost child-like view of tactical aircraft capabilities in particular is also a massive blessing for U.S. defense contractors who are in increasingly close orbit with the White House. Someone with this level of comprehension about complex weapon systems does not represent a good negotiator or strategist when it comes to procurement decisions and setting up America’s military capabilities mix. Instead they represent an easily persuadable mark with the power to make or break major defense deals worth billions of dollars. And those defense contractors are playing ball when it comes to feeding the President’s ego with great results to show for it. As I noted last May : It is pretty clear Trump has been personally spoon-fed the F-35 brochure from LockMart and the program office. Without any point of reference, it all must seem pretty wondrous. Oh and the program he was so critical of during his campaign is now magically fixed because he made a phone call. Totally ridiculous to the point that its downright insulting. And really, nothing of this has to do with the jet itself, just a new slathering of politics that surrounds it. To be honest, I had high hopes that Trump could spur systemic change within the DoD’s procurement process. Those hopes have faded rapidly over the last three months. It seems that he is far more interested in selectively intervening in a few high-profile programs he has interest in so that he can claim fake victories and gloat about them endlessly to the press, and the defense industry is happy to oblige him if it means funding certainty and a strong order book. As Trump would put it: “sad.” None of this would be much of an issue if Trump didn’t inject himself directly into major Pentagon procurement issues or insist in talking in detail about particular weapon systems that he has a poor working knowledge of even on a conceptual level. Instead he could leave these types of statements to others and just paint in broad strategic strokes. As for what about talking to the Coast Guard seems to trigger a Trump speech about the F-35’s abilities, there is no clear answer for that.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 22, 2022",Rare IRST Pod Toting “Ghost” F-16D Likely Based At Area 51 Spotted In Star Wars Canyon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Jedi Transition has become a Mecca for aviation photographers from around the globe, with all types of aircraft being snapped while maneuvering dynamically through Rainbow Canyon, also commonly referred to as “Star Wars Canyon.” And sometimes rare aircraft make an appearance , but in the case of photographer David Atkinson, he didn’t just catch an atypical type of aircraft, he caught a flying ghost of sorts. At first glance the Block 30 F-16D pictured above, serial number 86-0052, may look like any other F-16, but upon closer examination its registration and the unique equipment it carries makes it clear that it is anything but. On the right intake “chin” station, the F-16 carries an infrared search and track (IRST) pod. You can learn all about what an IRST is and how they are being introduced onto American fighter aircraft in this past in-depth post of mine . But in summary, they have the ability to detect and discriminate enemy aircraft targets at relatively long ranges in a passive in manner. In other words, they don’t emit detectable electromagnetic energy like radar waves in order to detect an aircraft from afar, instead they do so by sensing the aircraft’s infrared signature, which is especially tough to hide for fast-flying, high-performance fighters—even stealthy ones. The F-14D was the last American tactical aircraft to fly with an operational IRST. Modern iterations of the system reemerged six years after the Tomcat’s retirement, appearing only one time , mounted on an F-16C belonging to the 64th Aggressor Squadron during a Red Flag exercise. Since then the Super Hornet program has added an IRST to their upgrade pathway which is now underway . New production Strike Eagle export variants also feature the “Tiger Eyes” IRST mounted above their targeting pod. The USAF is slated to equip some of its “Golden Eagle” F-15Cs with a podded IRST system, with both Lockheed’s Legion Pod and Northrop Grumman’s similar offering competing for the contract. In the end the Legion Pod won . The F-15C/D’s Talon Hate communications node pod program also includes an IRST in its forward bay. What all these initiatives and systems have in common is that they all feature the same IRST sensor— Lockheed’s IRST21 based on an upgraded version of the AN/AAS-42 IRST that equipped the F-14D. So what is this random F-16 doing carrying an IRST pod that doesn’t really exist in the USAF’s inventory? That has to do with where it is likely based. 86-0052 is more or less a ghost. It has not been traced to a base for nearly a decade according to F-16.net and no photos of it have been taken for quite some time, at least as far as we can tell, yet the airframe is active. Block 30 “big inlet” F-16Ds are known to fly without any base markings out of Groom Lake , otherwise known as Area 51. These aircraft are clearly seen in satellite photos and have even been photographed flying around the Nellis Range Complex, often carrying a white instrumentation pod on its wing rail along with other pods, including electronic warfare systems. They have been seen sparing with Su-27s flown by the highly secretive Red Hats squadron , but their primary use is likely to chase test articles and document their flights, and to provide a sensor platform for evaluating different aspects on new and exotic designs. F-16s on their ramp at Groom Lake. Usually between one and four F-16s can be seen parked here at any given time. The ramp was totally refurbished in the middle of the last decade. , Google Earth Larger aircraft carry out this mission as well, including the grotesquely modified NT-43A, which often uses the callsign “Rat55,” but the F-16 with a podded sensor system offers testers a less expensive and far more nimble platform for evaluating the infrared signatures of various clandestine aircraft and modifications. Amazingly, just days ago, what is likely this same exact F-16 was photographed doing just that near Area 51. In this case it was chasing an F-117 Nighthawk , with what appears to be its IRST pod attached. I have long posited that a handful of F-117s still flying are being used to evaluate new low observable applications and radar attenuating structures. As I wrote in 2014 : “At the time of the F-117s official retirement, and its subsequent banishment to tomb-like hangars deep in the Nevada Desert, the aircraft was the most understood low observable platform in the history of aeronautics. Hundreds of thousands of hours were flown on the fleet of 64 aircraft (including pre-production versions), crashes were deeply investigated and improvements on the effectiveness of the aircraft were constantly being made. In other words, the F-117 is a known commodity to the DoD and the USAF, and this is especially true when it comes to the aircraft’s unique radar, radio and infrared signature. In fact, I would not be surprised if the F-117 represents the most studied aircraft “signature” of all time. With this in mind, the F-117 could be theoretically used as something of a “flying measuring stick” for evaluating a radar system’s ability to detect and track low-observable flying objects. Or conversely, it could be used as a surrogate to test new radar absorbent materials and coatings applied to its flat, facet like structure that was originally built to accept such applications. By specifically utilizing the F-117 for such-real life tests and evaluations, defense program managers could have a control variable, in this case the F-117′s well documented radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature, and an independent variable for which to test upon it. That independent variable being an experimental radar absorbent material or other signature control application. Testers of new signature control applications, such as an innovative new version of radar absorbent material (RAM), could leverage highly accurate real-life metrics and historical data collected throughout the life and development of the F-117. They can then fly their new application on the jet so that new data can be collected for which to compare and help judge the effectiveness of the experimental capability being tested. On the radar and infrared tracking side of argument, the F-117 is also a near-perfect and highly available low observable aircraft to test everything from ground based radars and SAM systems, both foreign and domestic, AWACS modifications, fighter radars and even infrared search and track systems. By doing so, testers can come up with a clear idea of what the capabilities of the system being tested are against a hard to detect target. In doing so, tacticians can work on solutions for defeating any weaknesses in the system while at the same time working on emphasizing its unique strengths. Even keeping a couple “sterile” F-117s available for calibrating and improving the DYCOMS array at Groom Lake, used for measuring the radar cross sections of aircraft flying under real world conditions, may be in itself an entirely necessary and worthwhile reason to keep a small cadre of F-117s operational.” So there you have it, this seems to be a rare sighting of a specially equipped F-16 that lives its life out in the most highly classified flight test center in the world. Clearly American stealthy aircraft designs’ weakness when it comes to IRST capabilities is and should be a serious concern as these systems are a staple of Russian and Chinese designs and are seen as one key way to negate the advantage of a combat aircraft that possesses a tiny radar cross-section. It is also possible if not probable that these Groom Lake based F-16s visit Edwards AFB from time to time, as the flight test unit out of Area 51 is a detachment of the greater USAF flight test establishment based at Edwards, and especially key elements based at Edwards’ shadowy North Base installation. Shooting aircraft in the Jedi Transition is often related to fishing—you simply never know what you are going to get, if anything at all. But in this case David Atkinson caught himself a rare specimen indeed. Update : Theaviationist.com just posted a good spot on a photograph we didn’t have at the time of publishing, noting the pilots are indeed wearing a Red Hats and a Red Eagles patch—both of which have long histories when it comes to foreign materiel exploitation (FME) programs—flying foreign aircraft to learn their strengths and weaknesses and to train against them. So basically this confirms the aircraft’s home base and at least one or possibly two units that get to fly these aircraft out of Groom Lake. Once again, read all about the Red Hats here . If you zoom in you can see the patches each crewman wears are those of two secretive units, the Red Hats and Red Eagles. , David Atkinson Update: Photographer Alan Chadwick got an incredible shot of this same aircraft, clearly showing the pilots wearing Red Hats and Red Eagles patches.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 10, 2017",Russia Scooped Up Wrecks Of Its Crashed Naval Fighters Off The Seafloor Near Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Roughly a year ago, two Russian Navy fighters ended crashing into the ocean during recovery operations aboard the carrier Kuznetsov while it was sailing off the coast of Syria. The mishaps occurred during the vessel’s very high profile cruise, which started from its base on the frigid Barents Sea, to support what at the time was a wide-scale operation to crush the anti-Assad resistance in Aleppo, Syria. Now it is reported that Russia’s “oceanographic research vessel” Yantar located the wrecks and worked to quickly recover or destroy any sensitive systems still intact on the fighters. One Su-33 and one Mig-29KR were lost in the separate incidents. The Su-33s did receive some upgrades before their last cruise, although overall their systems are dated. The MiG-29KR is another story. It represents one of the most modern fighters in Russia’s inventory. On October 10th, 2016, before the Kuznetsov’s cruise The War Zone wrote : “The much-touted deployment of the Admiral Kuznetsov will include a newly configured air wing with more advanced air combat capabilities than in the past. Originally it seemed as if Russia’s new MiG-29KR (well kind of new) multi-role fighters would be the carrier’s lone fixed-wing fighter for the deployment, with the ship’s massive and antiquated Su-33s being put to pasture. This is now clearly not the case. Russia has executed a light upgrade of a portion of the tiny Su-33 fleet, which includes some modernized avionics and possibly the addition of the SVP-24 system , which helps improve accuracy of dumb bombs–the vast majority of air-to-ground weapons used on Syrian targets by Russian aircraft. While it’s an improvement on previous targeting systems, this new-found accuracy is not even remotely comparable to any modern guided air-to-ground munitions. These Su-33s also appear to have been overhauled mechanically and feature new paint. Admiral Kuznetsov will likely sail with examples of both the Su-33 and the MiG-29KR stuffed into its tight hangar deck.” With this in mind, you can see how quickly locating these aircraft on the seafloor and either extracting them, parts of them, or destroying them entirely would be a worthwhile cause for the Kremlin, especially considering the U.S. has craft capable of extracting parts of aircraft and missiles without even being noticed. Russian news outlets recently reported that Yantar was sent to the area Kuznetsov was operating in at the time of the incidents on December 10th, just five days after the Su-33 crashed there, and that the mission occurred with the help of underwater unmanned vehicles, writing: The Russian Navy conducted a unique deep-sea operation. With the help of underwater unmanned vehicles and the oceanographic research vessel Yantar , the Su-33 and MiG-29K deck fighter aircraft, lost in air crashes in the Mediterranean, were discovered and inspected. This was reported to Izvestia at the headquarters of the Northern Fleet. UAVs were able to remove some aircraft equipment from aircraft… …According to Izvestia, the operation was carried out by the oceanographic research vessel (OIS) Yantar . The robots surveyed both planes, picked up the debris from the bottom and even removed some elements of the onboard equipment MiG-29 and Su-33. Yantar , or “Amber” in Russian. Notice the huge doors that cover the submersibles and their elaborate crane system., Almaz Design Bureau Yantar , which is a known spy ship, was delivered to the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet in 2015 and is specifically equipped for underwater missions, with the ability to reach depths of 18,000 feet. These can include sensitive salvage operations, as in this instance, or manipulating—or even cutting during wartime —key underwater communications cables. The ship is 354 feet long and displaces 5,735 tons. It is equipped with modern azipods for precision station keeping during operations. The vessel carries submersibles that can operate many thousands of feet below the waterline, including the Konsul class deep-diving manned submersible, as well as various unmanned types. Although Yantar is often found snooping around major underwater communications cables, it can also assist in locating stricken submarines and other sunken objects at incredible depths. With that in mind, just last week Russia ordered Yantar to the waters off Argentina to help in locating the ARA San Juan which went missing nearly 11 days ago. The ship is slated to begin search operations in the area during the first week of December. The quick move by Russia to scoop up any sensitive material remaining on its dunked fighters is just another reminder of how active the spy game under the waves remains to this very day, one in which one country’s tragedy can turn into another country’s treasure. And these clandestine “treasure hunters” of sorts are incredibly well equipped and can be actively on the hunt at a moment’s notice.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Test pilots are truly a breed of their own and some have seen and done amazing things that they will never be able to talk about. USAF Lt. Col. Norman “Ken” Dyson is one of these men, but luckily he can talk about flying two of the most game-changing top secret experimental aircraft of the second half of the 20th Century. Metaphorically speaking, Dyson wasn’t just part of the stealth revolution, he was one of two pilots who actually took that revelation into the air for the first time, and the only one who followed up and did it again with a second generation of stealth aircraft design. Dyson flew F-100s and F-4s in Vietnam and went on to become a test pilot. He was part of the F-15A test team when America’s iconic air superiority fighter was still in its infancy, before he faded into the dark world of classified flight testing. There he would work on projects that would later become legendary once they were declassified and changed the future of aerial warfare forever. The Skunk Works' revolutionary Have Blue technology demonstrator took to the skies over Groom Lake for the first time 39 years ago today. pic.twitter.com/PHWU8Gqjua — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 1, 2016 Dyson describes his amazing and unexpected journey into the classified world of early stealth aerospace technology in what is an absolutely fascinating recorded presentation that is on record with the National Museum of the United States Air Force. It offers an unprecedented insight into the flight test program of Have Blue—Lockheed Skunk Works’ radically exotic faceted test aircraft that was based on the company’s “Hopeless Diamond” design—a software generated (ECHO 1) concept that looked totally un-flyable at the time of its creation in the mid 1970s. Ken Dyson and Have Blue, Texas A&M University/Lockheed/USAF In order to reach the flight test stage, Lockheed’s Have Blue design won out against Northrop’s concept under the XST program, which you can read all about in this past feature of mine . Although both Have Blue demonstrators crashed, the work done with them quietly gave birth to the F-117 Nighthawk . But not long after the Have Blue program wrapped up later, Northrop, along with Ken Dyson, would get its shot at testing a more advanced stealth technology than what Have Blue offered—one that featured continuously curving rounded structures instead of flat faceted ones. This of course was Northrop’s Tacit Blue , also known as The Whale, or by the overreaching program it was used for, the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental, or BSAX for short. You can also read all about this program and its massive implications on everything from how the USAF does reconnaissance to future stealth aircraft design to unmanned aircraft by reading this other past feature of mine . Ken Dyson is the only pilot that flew both aircraft that are largely credited with giving birth to and validating the long brewing idea of stealth aircraft that could leave many radars blind as to their presence nearby. Listen to the entire presentation by clicking here. Some of the highlights include: Dyson calls the Have Blue a “small fella” and recounts how it could almost taxi underneath a F-117 Nighthawk’s wing. The Have Blue aircraft not only used the F-16’s fly-by-wire system but also its side-stick controller. These technologies were extremely young at the time, even for the F16 to use yet alone a exotic flying technology demonstrator. Dyson and his Lockheed counterpart Bill Park were among the first pilots who also flew the F-16—in a two seat B model in their case—to get accustomed to the flight control concepts and side-stick controller they would be using when flying Have Blue. They also flew in the T-Bird variable stability aircraft that could mimic Have Blue’s projected flight characteristics. The crash of the first Have Blue was wrongly described in most literature. After the crash Lockheed test pilot Bill Park, who was injured fairly severely, was half jokingly told that he was only allowed to eject from four aircraft and he wouldn’t be flying another with an ejection seat. That’s right, four ejections and he lived to talk about them all. Ken Dyson was the only pilot to fly Have Blue 2. The Skunk Works team proved stealth could work with Have Blue 2. As Dyson put it: “We flew it as much as we could against everything we could.” The crash of Have Blue 2 occurred during a test against an F-15 and its powerful radar. Ken experienced seven negative Gs while trying to escape from the flailing experimental jet and his chute opened as he was ejecting. He was only up for ten minutes before he ejected at 20,000 feet. It would take another ten minutes before he hit the ground. The cause of the crash was a loose engine clasp that allowed hot gasses to damage the aircraft’s hydraulics. Have Blue had a variable geometry platypus tail kind of like the one on the B-2. It was called the “Platy” by the test team. Tacit Blue was only flown by five pilots. Its notoriously ugly looks made for some great one liners, including “they forgot to take it out of the box!” It was technically more unstable than Have Blue. It used the F/A-18 Hornet’s all digital fly-by-wire system and an elaborate array of conformal pressure sensors to stay pointed in the right direction while aloft. Tacit Blue’s tail had a span of 24 feet, two feet wider than the entire wingspan of Have Blue. The aircraft had bad hydraulic problems before its first flight, with the system finally working on the 19th ground engine test run. The closely spaced engines that shared a common air inlet could only be started at nearly the same time because after one was running the other wouldn’t get enough air. Along with tons of simulator training, Whale pilots also flew in a variable stability trainer, this time in the far more ungainly NC-131H TIFS. After leaving the USAF not long after flying Tacit Blue, Ken Dyson went on to have an awesome career with Rockwell. There he worked on multiple flight test programs, including flying the B-1B through its teething years and the ultra-maneuverable thrust-vectoring X-31. He retired from Rockwell as the company’s chief test pilot in 1993. Here are some pics of Have Blue and Tacit Blue.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been since September 15th that Pyongyang fired off a ballistic missile—that is until today. The nighttime test launch sent a projectile on a very steep parabolic flight profile over the Korean Peninsula and the Sea of Japan, with the missile splashing down 600 miles from its launch point. Although the metrics are likely to change, at this time South Korea’s Yonhap News reports that the missile reached an altitude of 2,800 miles. If true, this would be the most advanced and longest-range missile test North Korea has ever executed. The missile flew for nearly an hour, 50 minutes to be exact, and originated from Sain Ni, North Korea. The Pentagon’s initial assessment also states that it was an ICBM, and President Trump was supposedly briefed while the missile was still in flight. Kim Jong Un inspects the HS-14 ICBM before a previous launch of the missile., North Korea State Media The last time North Korea conducted an ICBM test, one of only two launches so far, the missile traveled roughly 620 miles laterally and reached an altitude of 2,300 miles. With this in mind, this latest launch would represent a massive leap in capability, adding nearly 500 miles in altitude which translates into far greater range when fired on a downrange optimized attack profile. The July 28th Hwasong-14 launch profile resulted in an estimated range of over 6,000 miles. This latest launch would likely signify a range increase of roughly 20 to 25 percent, or an estimated range of roughly 7,200 miles. Such reach would put almost anywhere in the Continental US within striking distance for Pyongyang, including Washington DC and New York City. Once again, these metrics will likely change somewhat as more telemetry and tracking information is released and studied. The launch also smacks down ridiculous theories that the Trump Administration’s bellicose rhetoric , constant and growing displays of force , and demands for total and unconditional denuclearization (in other words total capitulation ) by North Korea have somehow changed the rogue regime’s immediate behavior or long-term nuclear strategy. We will keep this post updated over the next 12 hours as more information becomes available. Update 1:25pm PST: The President addressed the launch by saying simply that “well handle it” and “we’ll take care of it.” Secretary of Defense Mattis had a little more to say and noted that the missile indeed had greater performance than what has been seen in any previous test. Full video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZewAchm-xiA Update 7:30pm PST: Perfectly predictable and on cue, ROK forces fired some short-range ballistic missiles following North Korea’s ICBM launch. A consistently lame , pointless, wasteful and childish reactionary display of force. North Korea claims the missile is a “Hwasong-15,” which is a new designation, and that it can hit the entire US. This concurs with our initial estimate. North Korean state media says Kim Jong Un personally oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-15. We are still waiting on pictures and video from the launch site. The Hwasong-15, or HS-15, could be an evolutionary upgrade and refinement of the HS-14 ICBM.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday served as an unwanted reminder for many that North Korea is indeed still hurtling headlong toward their strategic endgame. Not only was it another launch of an ICBM by the rogue regime, the third so far, but it also featured a huge increase in range. North Korea can now theoretically hit any target in the United States. What wasn’t clear at the time of the launch was if the missile was an evolved variant of the existing Hwasong-14 or some new design. But hours after the launch, North Korea state media said that it was indeed a new design—it’s designation being Hwasong-15. Now we have pictures of this new missile and they are terrifying as they are impressive. There is no denying it, the HS-15 is a huge missile that dwarfs the HS-14 in girth and likely in length as well. Upon quick examination, the HS-15 looks like it uses two main engine nozzles instead of the one found on the HS-14. It also features a full diameter second stage as opposed to the tapered one on the HS-14. The nose cone design is of special interest. It is much broader than its predecessor and features the blunt nose shape that North Korea has been showing for years but has never test flown—until now. The missile seems large enough to potentially be able to accommodate multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) or one large nuclear device. Finally, the transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) is something new as well. This version features nine axles, one more than any other TEL we have ever seen in North Korea’s possession. Everything appears up-sized as well, including its hydraulic actuators that raise the massive missile into firing position, its transport collar, and its launch stand. If anything, I would venture to say that this missile has more performance to give than what we have already seen. Additionally, we still don’t know what fuel it is leveraging, especially for its second stage. North Korea has made some big leaps in various missile technologies as of late, including those surrounding the production of solid rocket fuel and light-weight structures. Many analysts are pouring over these photos as this is being written and surely more revelations as to this new missile design will quickly come to light.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During a failed coup attempt by Hugo Chavez’s Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 in 1992, the second in that year, anti-government forces included commandeered OV-10 Broncos and other tactical aircraft seized at Venezuelan Air Force bases. This led to the crazy close-in, low-level engagement between one of those Broncos and a M61 cannon-slinging F-16A pilot loyal to the Venezuelan government. This incident can be seen the relatively astonishing video below. The footage is remarkable as it is shot by a bystander on the ground and shows the F-16 turning into the OV-10 before popping its speed brakes and letting loose a burst of 20mm cannon shells. The OV-10E stood little chance against the marauding Viper, and its shattered airframe burst into flames before careening into the ground. The whole engagement appears to have occurred just a couple hundred feet in the air. It was one of three kills by two F-16 pilots, including one more Bronco and a AT-27 Tucano, that occurred during the coup attempt. Venezuelan Air Force Venezuelan F-16s are something of an oddity as they originally were the first Vipers exported to South America. In 1982 a deal was signed between Venezuela and the U.S. government for 18 Block 15 F-16As and six F-16B models. The jets would replace aging Mirage IIIs that made up the backbone of the country’s tactical air arm. Originally Venezuela was slated to received downgraded J79 turbojet powered F-16/79s , but Reagan opened up export restrictions killing that program and allowing for F-16A/Bs to be exported to second tier allies. By the mid 2000s, under then firebrand President Hugo Chavez, the U.S. embargoed all arms sales to Venezuela. As a result, the country’s F-16s would be useless within a matter of months—or at least that was the plan. Instead the Venezuelan Air Force kept their F-16s flyable outside of OEM support—a major undertaking to say the least. At one time in his turbulent relationship with the U.S., Chavez, who was livid over the embargo, said he would sell the jets and their sensitive systems to Iran. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PKU2P8aB6dA In the end Venezuela turned more heavily toward Russia and other sources for their military technology and weaponry needs. Eventually the Venezuelan Air Force took delivery of two dozen Russian Su-30MK2s to augment their F-16s in the high-end multi-role fighter role. A Venezuelan SU-30MK2 sits idle under its shelter. The type serves alongside the F-16 as Venezuela’s top-line fighter force. , André Du-pont/Wikicommons Some sources state that Venezuela’s remaining F-16s have received upgrades and support from Israel, including the addition of Python IV air-to-air missiles and laser targeting pods. Also there had been rumors that Venezuela supplied Iran with an F-16 for technical exploitation, although this has never been proven . What we do know is that Venezuela has kept its Vipers viable in some part via leveraging the black market for parts. Considering nearly 5,000 F-16s have been built, and many A/B models have since been retired, the ability to obtain critical components is likely less challenging than one would think. A Venezuelan F-16B seen with a Python training round., Rob Schleiffert /Wikicommons Also of note, American-built F-16s have been involved in other coup attempts, most notably the one that occurred in Turkey in July of 2016. During the failed power-grab, F-16s flown by anti-Erdogan aligned pilots played a major role, including flying down streets at high-speed in afterburner and assaulting key targets. F-16 pilots loyal to the sitting administration also played a role and even protected the President’s aircraft . The historic event that has had massive impacts on Turkish society offered its own incredible imagery of F-16s in action, but nothing as dynamic as what was recorded in Venezuela on November 27th, 1992. Update: Our friend Thomas Newdick offered up a picture of a Venezuelan Viper toting a LITENING targeting pod of Israeli origin as suspected. Update: Here is video supposedly showing the second Bronco being shot down. Amazing that both engagements were caught on tape like this if this isn’t another angle of the first video.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 11, 2021",Pentagon Flight Testers Now Have Their Own Mock Air War Called “Orange Flag”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just weeks ago, the 412th Operations Group at Edwards AFB managed a little-known, multi-service training event called “Orange Flag.” The name is a play on other large force employment (LFE) exercises that use the term flag, like Red Flag, and the color orange, which is the traditional color of the flight testing community. 28 aircraft from bases that make up the DoD’s flight test mecca in southwest California and southern Nevada—namely Edwards AFB, NAWS China Lake, Nellis AFB, and NAWS Point Mugu, took to the skies for a corporative training and developmental event that would stress-test a multitude of existing systems and push ongoing programs farther toward maturity. Even testers at Eglin AFB in Florida took part in the event. Principally, the event tests the ability for America’s fighter, command and control aircraft, bombers, and other support aircraft to operate seamlessly, or as near seamlessly as possible. This included drawing aircraft, aircrews, and testers from both the Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT) sides of the testing community. Whereas DT is more focused on the development of new technologies and systems, OT works to refine these systems into a more mature state, validate them, and create tactics for operational use. F-35s and F-16s taxi for a Orange Flag mission., USAF In a USAF press release , Lt. Col. Richard Turner, deputy commander of the 412th Operations Group and an F-35 test pilot, described how executing Orange Flag required collaboration with units from across the country and across the sometimes rigid boundaries placed between the services: The ‘developmental’ objectives were developed by the 412th Test Wing here, the 96th Test Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida, and the Navy’s VX-31 Test Squadron at NAWS China Lake. The ‘operational’ objectives came from the 53rd Test Wing at Nellis, and the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Operational Test Team at Edwards… This was an important advance in how we vet our weapon systems in DT and OT… Orange Flag required a huge team effort and I look forward to seeing it impact the warfighter in the future.” The idea behind Orange Flag is to move from more limited cross-platform and cross-service testing, such as between just two discreet aircraft types, to a more inclusive model that is more representative of the total force. By doing so, systems in development and operational testing can mature faster as problems and opportunities to improve these systems can be identified earlier. There are other synergistic effects as well. Bringing disparate parts of the flight test and flying communities together to achieve an overreaching goal means the sharing of ideas and expertise, and learning to operate in a far more dynamic test environment. Test engineer Kristofer Peterson noted how useful this approach can be: “The dataset will allow us to quickly identify issues across multiple platforms and even uncover issues we previously didn’t know about… However, to do this we require new analysis methods and we plan on leveraging the lessons learned from a data analytics innovation project funded by the test wing this past year.” Engineer Matt Smerk, who works specifically on interoperability between systems, also noted how testing early on like American forces actually fight is hugely beneficial: “We must be able to integrate and interoperate our joint forces across a wide range of mission areas. OFEs enable the test community to capture data to assess the military utility of integrating and interoperating multiple platforms in an environment not done via traditional DT.” The diverse list of aircraft that were flown during Orange Flag is impressive and includes F-35A/B, F-22, F-15E, F-15C, F-16C/D, F/A-18E, EA-18G, E-2C, and B-1B. Putting over two dozen aircraft, many of which are dissimilar in nature, into the same airspace also presents its challenges and learning opportunities. Edwards AFB’s resident B-1B takes off. , USAF Lt. Col. Chris Buckley, who is responsible for the mishmash of restricted airspace used for testing over the Mojave Desert, describes how different this approach is for controllers who support the testers and how even executing Orange Flag was a major sea change in how they traditionally do business: “The airspace was designed to test 1950’s technology… We’ve made spectacular headway turning it into a place we can test modern systems, but only one at a time. The sheer volume of aircraft working together was a real concern. This event really tested the environment we need to do large-scale interoperability testing. This was the day our restricted airspace grew up and entered the 21st century.” The prospect that testers are now working on interoperability far earlier on in a system’s development cycle compared to in the past is exciting on multiple levels. It could mean that systems will reach the field faster and in a more mature state than they would have by executing this type of validation exercise far later in their development cycles. It also fits neatly with the USAF’s increasing focus on networking and interoperability—an initiative that has been turbocharged by Air Force Chief Of Staff David Goldfein. The F-117 pilot has made revolutionizing the way the Air Force and its partner services are connected the priority of his time as the highest ranking USAF officer. The connectivity focused Goldfein, who seems to see be more platform agnostic than anyone that has held his position in the past, summed up this viewpoint while talking to a group of defense writers last February, stating : “As we look at the 21st century, perhaps it’s time to focus less on the trucks and the cargo and more on the highway they ride on… Because traditionally, we’ve built weapons systems and procured munitions and sensors, and then looked at the way to connect them… In the future, we need to ask what is the network we will ride on and then what are the apps we’ll need to ride on that network…Some of those roll, walk, steam, fly and orbit and it is only as we can connect them as a family that we get multiple dilemmas for an enemy in multiple domains, where 1 plus 1 equals 3 or more.” Goldfein constantly talks about this subject during high-profile engagements. The top video below is just a taste of how the general sees the future of air combat in terms of networks and families of systems facing off against one another instead of the antiquated platform vs platform mentality (starts at the 41 minute mark). This is something I have pushed for years and have tried to convey consistently in my writing, and that’s why you don’t see any lame “F-15C vs Su-30: Who wins?” articles on any of my sites. The second video is of Goldfein talking about networking in terms of multi-domain battle concept: Networking is likely just a prominent focus for Orange Flag. Other ways in which various platforms integrate in a real flying environment, and even some of the tactics they leverage are also likely evaluated. Even though we are just now hearing about Orange Flag it is clearly a massive success and it looks as if it is going to become a staple within the military’s flight test community with iterations of the exercise planned every quarter starting in February of 2018.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Once in a while we are be blessed with an awesome video or picture taken from the Nellis Range Complex. Sometimes it is of secretive aircraft undergoing testing, or a B-1B screaming through the mountainous terrain at low level. But in this case it’s something really special—watch the world’s most capable fighter run down a diminutive A-4 Skyhawk as it turns and burns at very low-level in an attempt to save itself from seemingly certain death. This video may look like a “found footage” reel from Top Gun, but it also has a real wildlife documentary feel to it. These jets could just as well be a sparrow and a falcon, a mongoose and a viper, or a cheetah and a zebra, going about their life and death business in the animal kingdom. It’s candid and ultra aggressive and intoxicatingly exciting. The second that A-4 breaks the ridge, it really is a real-world holy shit moment. The A-4 shown is an ex-Kiwi A-4K now flown by Draken International. The A-4 is a classic adversary aircraft (read all about how they were flown against U.S. Navy fighter crews back in the ’80s in this special feature ), but the A-4Ks are among the most advanced “Scooters” ever built. They feature a version of the F-16A/B’s AN/APG-66 pulse doppler radar, mutli-function displays, radar warning receiver, modern weapons and stores interfaces, as well as a HUD and a hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) cockpit arrangement. Draken International has become deeply embedded into the adversary program at Nellis AFB, and are often seen flying out on Weapons School, Red Flag, or other missions toting AIM-9L/M Sidewinder captive training rounds and electronic warfare pods. You can read all about Draken’s A-4Ks and their role at Nellis AFB in this past article of mine. Draken’s gorgeous A-4Ks. , Draken International /Frank Crebas-Bluelife Aviatio n Back to the video: It’s not entirely clear if one Raptor was orbiting waiting as another F-22 drove the fleeing A-4 towards his wingman—a classic predatory trap—or just one F-22 was present and it waited for the Skyhawk to come into range before dropping behind him and killing him. Of special note is the F-22 can be seen opening its Sidewinder bay doors briefly at around the :27 mark. This wasn’t for a shot, so it may have been testing to make sure they are ready to go when the time comes. If anything, the video acts as a reminder that the F-22 community is willing and able to get down and dirty if the opportunity presents itself, and no, their mission is not all about long-range, beyond visual range volleys off missiles.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Japan May Turn Its F-15J Eagles Into Cruise Missile Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japan is at a strategic crossroads of sorts. The days of strict adherence to Article Nine of the country’s constitution are coming to an end as threats both new and old grow and evolve. Tokyo seems to be willing and able to move beyond the strategic confines of its post WWII past to become a more capable and longer-reaching military force that can project power well beyond its own territory and even its region. But considering what seems like an exponentially expanding threat posed by North Korea, as well as an increasingly hostile dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands , Japan finds itself in need of the ability to quickly strike deep into the heart of a contested territory on relatively short notice. Our own Joseph Trevithick detailed Japan’s emerging hunt for an advanced air-launched cruise missile. As we suspected, The Japan News now says this missile will likely be America’s highly capable and stealthy Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range, otherwise known as JASSM-ER. But what’s new in this report is that Japan would likely look toward its F-15J fleet to become the launch platform for this 2,000lb class weapon. Japan has roughly 200 license-built F-15s in service, with about a quarter of those being two seat F-15DJs. Currently all these aircraft fulfill the classic Eagle mission set of air superiority and air sovereignty, but they could be adapted to become Japan’s go-to long-range cruise missile trucks. The D models in particular, with its two crew stations, could be especially useful in this role. The F-15J has a long range for a tactical aircraft, which can greatly increase the range of an air launched cruise missile, especially when combined with aerial refueling., USAF Adapting the air superiority-focused F-15A/B/C/D into an attack platform is nothing new. In fact the F-15A/B was flying long-range strike missions operationally well before the air-to-ground optimized F-15E Strike Eagle entered service. This capability was pioneered by the Israeli Air Force, and was just the first step in decades of evolution that has seen IAF Eagles turned into multi-role fighter, networking, reconnaissance, and forward command and control platforms. You can read all about this fascinating history in this past feature of mine . Although it’s an untraditional pairing, JASSM-ER, which is capable of obliterating hardened targets in highly defended territory with a range in excess of 500 miles, would be an ideal fit for Japan’s Eagles. The F-15J has long legs for a tactical fighter and would have no problem lugging JASSM-ERs over relatively long distances. This gives JASSM-ER far more range than its static range capability, and the F-15’s range can be further extended with the help of aerial refueling by Japan’s KC-767s. All combined, such a concept would give Japan hard-hitting and survivable long-range striking power thousands of miles from Japanese territory. A KC-767A with a F-15J in tow. , Hunini/Wkicommons Such a capability would be very useful in striking against targets located deep in North Korean territory or even for deterring a possible marine landing operation on the Senkaku Islands or other potentially contested locales by Chinese forces. There are conflicting reports that Japan would like its new air-launched cruise missile to also be able to strike ships hundreds of miles away. It is possible that Japan could field the JASSM-ER land attack capability initiatively and then work with Lockheed to develop a follow-on deal to introduce robust anti-ship capability into the JASSM-ER design, likely pulling heavily from its Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM ) cousin. Alternatively, Japan could develop its own multi-role cruise missile in the coming years to augment the already fielded and higher-end JASSM-ER. We’ll see how this all pans out. With the Japanese Self Defense Force’s F-35s coming online in the near future, and with more F-35 purchases likely after Tokyo put its ambitious indigenous 5th generation fighter program on hold , JASSM-ER could give Japan’s aging F-15s added utility. F-15Js over the USS Carl Vinson. , USN Any air-launched cruise missile capability could very well also be bolstered by the introduction of a sea and shore-based long-range cruise missile capability, likely that of the latest iteration of the American Tomahawk cruise missile ( Block IV TACTOM ). The well proven design that now has both land attack and anti-ship capabilities can be fired from the vertical launch systems found on Japan’s high-end surface combatants as well as its upcoming Aegis Ashore anti-ballistic missile sites. We have written about this potential purchase in this past article . B-52 testing the AGM-109 air-launched version of the Tomahawk. The A-6 also did some testing with it but it never entered into an operational state. , Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images The Tomahawk can be air launched. At one time this was a capability that was looked at heavily by the US Navy and the USAF in the form of the AGM-109. But today there is no aerial platform that is capable of deploying the missile, nor are the Tomahawks in production optimized for such a delivery method. The F-15 is large and powerful enough to potentially accommodate the Tomahawk, which would provide even longer-range strike capabilities against both ships and ground targets, but the type is not as survivable of the very stealthy JASSM-ER. Still, going all Tomahawk could be the most flexible option and Raytheon would probably love to finally get the air launched version into service. Japan has been training heavily with US forces for contingency operations against North Korea. Having the ability to hit highly guarded targets at standoff ranges would be a huge plus to Japan’s capabilities in a Korean wartime scenario. Here F-15Js escort USAF B-1Bs and USMC F-35Bs on a training mission very near North Korea’s maritime border. , USAF We’ll keep you up to date as to Japan’s continuing search for a new strategic posture, and the weapons to make it happen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 14, 2017",Famous Nuclear Submarine That Starred In “Hunt For Red October” Has Been Retired,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Talk about things that make you feel old, the storied Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Dallas (SSN-700) was decommissioned by the U.S. Navy on December 5th, 2017 at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor. “The Big D” as it was lovingly called was best known for its starring role in the 1990 blockbuster Hunt For Red October. The movie and the Tom Clancy novel that it was adapted from were such a big deal that the ship’s unofficial motto has been “The Hunt Is On” ever since. Elaborate sets that articulated on dynamic platforms of the star submarines’ interiors were built for the movie, including one for Dallas . Other submarines were used for most of the exterior shots seen in the film, but it was Dallas that was being represented on the silver screen. The boat has also been featured in a number of other media releases, including other novels, video games, and various television shows, adding to its unique mystique and lore. Dallas was originally commissioned in July of 1981 and was just the 13th of 62 boats that make up the Los Angeles class. The submarine was somewhat unique at the time of her acceptance into the fleet as she was the first fast attack submarine to feature an all digital combat systems suite, making her a force to be reckoned with during the waning years of the Cold War. She was based her entire life on the east coast and executed 14 major deployments over her lifespan, traveling over a million miles in the process and visiting 30 countries. USS Dallas seen in 1982 not long after her commissioning., USN In 1998, Dallas went through a complex overhaul and refueling process, where she received new upgrades. The sub and her crew would have a greater focus on special operations support during the second half of her service, as she was fitted with a modular Dry Dock Shelter behind her sail that housed Swimmer Delivery Vehicles and other gear used by Navy SEALs. Dallas was also used to haul around the Navy’s now retired Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle , which also featured in Hunt For Red October , during a number of high-profile drills and exercises. USN The famous submarine was supposed to be retired in 2014 but that date was extended three years to 2017 after a dry dock fire badly damaged the far younger USS Miami (SSN-755). In all, the submarine has served for over 36 years, with thousands of submariners having walked her halls, slept in her bunks, and manned her stations. December 5th, 2017 Decommissioning ceremony for the Big D., USN The Dallas Maritime Museum Foundation wants to feature artifacts and components from the USS Dallas at a purpose-built facility located on the banks of the Trinity River in her namesake city. Originally it was hoped that the entire submarine could be displayed there, but the issues and cost surrounding denuclearizing it and removing its sensitive systems, not to mention a daunting proposed process of disassembling the 362 foot vessel, trucking it to Dallas and then reassembling it, are unlikely to be overcome. No other American nuclear submarine, aside from the first one ever, the USS Nautilus , serves as a museum attraction. USS Dallas is slated to begin the recycling process in 2023.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 11, 2023","Turkey Is Interested in Buying Surplus USMC AV-8B Harriers, Others Likely To Follow","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With F-35B production ramping up, the AV8 Harrier is entering into the twilight of its service with the United States Marine Corps. By most accounts, America’s Harrier fleet has quite a bit of life left in it, especially considering Pentagon picked up the UK’s entire fleet of 74 Harriers, many of which were very young, and all the spare parts that went with them, for cost of roughly 1.35 F-35Bs at today’s prices, or a paltry $177M. As a result, large quantities of surplus Harriers and ample stocks of spare parts are likely to be put up for sale by the DoD in the coming years. Considering the jet’s unique short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) abilities and its most recent upgrades—in the AV-8B+’s case this includes the ability to execute beyond-visual range air-to-air combat by employing the AIM-120 AMRAAM with their APG-65 radar sets—they represent an attractive and affordable acquisition opportunity for foreign air arms. Tyler Rogoway/Author According to Jane’s , Turkey is interested in purchasing a number of these soon to be surplus jump-jets to serve as an interim capability before possibly executing an F-35B purchase. This would be in addition to their already sizable F-35A order of 100 airframes. Supposedly Ankara is eyeing somewhere around 20 F-35Bs, so procuring a similar amount of second-hand AV-8Bs makes sense, although we don’t know the exact number they are interested in at this time. US Navy Turkey won’t likely be the last country interested in America’s Harriers. The type could also offer a relatively cheap option for countries wanting to acquire more potent amphibious capabilities, yet alone a proven ground attack platform with rudimentary air-to-air capability as well. Some countries even have amphibious assault ships that may be able to accommodate Harriers. Australia even has their license-built Canberra class , which is based on a Spanish design , that features a ski jump, but they have no fixed-wing STOVL aircraft capable of using it. Other countries that put a high value on dispersed and austere operations could also be Harrier bargain hunters. Taiwan in particular could benefit from the Harrier’s capabilities and some cash-flush Middle Eastern air arms could also become interested in them in an attempt to reduce their reliance of massive airstrips that would become targets for ballistic missiles and other types of attack in the opening stages of any sort of major conflict. Tyler Rogoway/Author Countries that have island holdings in disputed areas—namely the South China Sea— like say Vietnam —could make good use of the Harrier’s unique capabilities as well. Other air arms that just want a super competent close air support and interdiction platform could jump on these jump jets too if the price is right. Even sales opportunities in South America are possible. We’ll keep an eye on where this Turkish initiative goes. If it does come to fruition it could be just the start of the international haggling for the rest of the fleet that will come fully available in the coming decade.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The US Navy Wants Its EA-18G Growlers to Drop Canisters With Drones Tucked Inside,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Northrop Grumman says the U.S. Navy is interested in giving its EA-18G Growler jamming aircraft the ability to use modified cluster bomb canisters to deploy and control their own drone swarms to launch broader electronic attacks and collect signals intelligence data. Any fighter jet or bomber could conceivably carry the disposable unmanned aircraft, referred to both as Dash X and Remedy, as well, which might be able to take on covert surveillance and even strike duties in the future. On Oct. 26, 2017, Northrop Grumman conducted a flight test of the drone at Foothills Regional Airport in Morganton, North Carolina, but launched it from the ground rather than a canister attached to another aircraft. Once the Dash X was in flight, a modified de Havilland Dash-8 twin engine turboprop then successfully established a link to the drone, directing its activities and processing electronic signal information the unmanned aircraft was collecting. The next phase of the project will be to demonstrate the complete airdrop concept, which involves a cluster bomb-like shell containing one of the pilotless planes. The Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Air Systems Command’s F/A-18 and EA-18G program office, and the Office of Secretary of Defense are supporting the Virginia-headquartered defense contractor’s work on the Dash X, which has a wingspan of 12 feet, a top speed of just 70 miles per hour, and can fly for approximately 10 hours. The small aviation firm VX Aerospace , which specializes in composite materials and is also involved in the program, initially developed the drone in partnership with North Carolina State University and the University of South Carolina as part of an earlier ONR-funded project. The Navy appears most interested in adding this drone “bomb” to its Block II upgrade program for the EA-18G, John Thompson, Northrop Grumman’s campaign director for the company’s airborne command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) division, told reporters during a tour of a facility near Baltimore, Maryland. “I think that long-range teaming is where the highest probability of fielding this is going to go,” he added. A US Navy EA-18G Growler, which could carry and then team up with air-dropped Dash X drones., USN Though Thompson did not elaborate on exactly how the Navy was considering blending the Growlers and Dash X together, it’s not hard to imagine the two aircraft working as a manned-unmanned team . The drone could extend the range and breadth of EA-18G’s capabilities, fanning out and searching for enemy radars, communication nodes, and other electronic signal emitters. The goal is obviously to feed at least basic information back to the controlling aircraft to help the crew find and prioritize targets and just give them a better sense of the overall battlefield environment and its electronic order of battle. Depending on the equipment that can fit inside a single Dash X, it might be able to act as a decoy , generating signals that make it look like a larger threat to air defense systems, or even conduct their own distributed electronic or cyber attacks , as well. “We did a demonstration where these [the Dash X] flew forward, looked for an unlocated RF [radio frequency] object, they went out and they found that vehicle,” Thompson told the assembled journalists . “They listened for the whispering and they pulled it back to this test airframe and they were able to detect, identify, and geolocate.” And though Northrop Grumman hasn’t yet settled on a final design, the company provided a picture of a mockup of the bomb-like shell looks almost identical to the U.S. military’s standardized SUU-64/B, -65/B and -66/B Tactical Munitions Dispensers, which can hold variety of different cluster munitions . According to Northrop Grumman, after release from the aircraft, whatever the eventual container used will be, it will break open and the Dash X will fall out, slowed by a parachute before its wings unfold and its motor starts. A Tactical Munition Dispenser, a modified version of which might be able to hold a single Dash X drone., US Army Using a modified cluster munition would make it relatively easy to load the system onto existing aircraft such as the EA-18G. It also means that a single aircraft would be able to carry more than one Dash X at a time, deploying swarms of unmanned aircraft that would be able to better monitor a certain zone for threats or faster search for particular points of interest across a broader area. “We’ll send in these as a swarm,” Thompson explained. “They’ll begin to do search patterns for where we believe — in this general area is — this object that we are searching for. Could be [searching for] theatre ballistic missile, long range engagement radar, short-range engagement radar.” Northrop Grumman is also pitching the air-dropped Dash X concept as a way for aircraft, such as the non-stealthy F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets and EA-18Gs in the Navy’s carrier air wings, to conduct electronic warfare and intelligence gathering missions deep into denied territory full of networked air defenses. There’s no reason a low-observable aircraft, such as the F-35 with its already potentially impressive ability to vacuum up electronic signal data, couldn’t carry them, as well. Thompson said that the drone’s small size and slow speed mean it has reduced radar and acoustic signatures that make it hard for opponents to spot on radar and difficult to quickly identify as a military drone. Even if they did see it on their radar screens, they might be inclined to dismiss the slow moving drone as something else entirely non-threatening. Below is video of another air-launched drone swarm test that the Department of Defense conducted in 2016, which you can read about in more detail here . “How does a company go from making B-21s to this?” Thompson posed to reporters. “It is actually survivable because it is absolutely so slow and so small, when you think about how military systems are designed, they’re designed to shoot down tactical jets and you actually build into radars gates that take away things just as birds.” Dash X is supposed to be able to fly high enough to be out of sight and earshot of personnel on the ground, but still low and slow enough as to not attract attention on radar. In additional to the electronic warfare systems, Thompson said it could carry electro-optical cameras, which could send a video feed back to a controlling aircraft or other friendly personnel in near real time. It might also be able to do so on the cheap, especially compared to more advanced manned and unmanned stealth aircraft, something Northrop Grumman already has significant experience with. In addition to the present B-2 Spirit and future B-21 Raider stealth bombers , the firm has also reportedly built a high-flying, long range intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone, the RQ-180 , specifically to covertly gather information deep inside denied regions, and other classified projects . Unfortunately, the small size of the Dash X drone also limits how far it can fly and how long it can loiter over a particular area. The air-dropped “bomb” is supposed to help mitigate this issue, since a manned aircraft could carry it closer to the target area. A US Air Force F-16 carrying a pair of Tactical Munition Dispensers, another platform that could potentially launch and pair up with Dash X drones., Lockheed Martin Taken together, these capabilities open up the possibility for the Dash X taking on additional mission sets beyond just supporting the Navy’s Growlers. In particular, the system could help give carrier air wings some semblance of capability they might have otherwise gained from the Navy’s now cancelled Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike, or UCLASS , program. This effort sought to develop a stealthy, deep penetrating drone capable of both intelligence gathering and strike missions in denied areas that could take off and land from an aircraft carrier. The US Navy had extensively tested a pair of experimental Northrop Grumman X-47B drones as part of an initial technology demonstration program that was supposed to lead into the larger UCLASS project. The service is now looking to buy a tanker drone with a limited, secondary surveillance capability , to extend the range of its Super Hornets instead. The air-dropped Dash X is significantly smaller and less capable, but could offer the Navy a different kind of tool for penetrating into heavily defended regions. The Northrop Grumman’s X-47B carrier-launched drone technology demonstrator., USN The complete system might be able to take on more novel roles in the future, too. Thompson said that the Navy’s present plan was to focus on a drone that could carry electronic warfare systems and other sensors, but that it might be possible to arm Dash X in the future to be able to attack targets on its own. It might even make sense to morph the drone into a covert loitering munition. Manned aircraft could then drop swarms of Dash X drones with explosive payloads to fly orbits around certain areas, unbeknownst to the enemy, ready to strike at exactly the right moment, whether the target was the crew of a road-mobile ballistic missile transporter-erector-launcher or a terrorist leader in their car . American special operations forces have already reportedly stepped up their use of man-portable loitering munitions, such as AeroVironment’s Switchblade . Northrop Grumman’s proposal isn’t without potential pitfalls, though. Regardless of whether Thompson’s comments about the potential for Dash X to slip by enemy radars unnoticed are accurate, many countries, the United States included, are becoming increasingly more aware of the threat of small drones . In turn, there has been a surge in development of new radars and associated short-range air defense systems . Small unmanned aircraft, including types readily available commercially, are only becoming more popular and common tools in conflicts around the world both for state security forces and insurgents and terrorists . The drones also may not be entirely invisible to the naked eye . Depending on how low it has to fly in order to best use its sensor package, enemy troops may be able to readily see it during the day. Only exceptionally large birds, such as the California condor , have anything approaching a 12-foot wingspan. They don’t dangle from parachutes, even briefly, either, but the idea is probably to launch this well outside of the target area. A modified Bradley Fighting Vehicle, festooned with radars, jammers, and surface-to-air missiles, that BAE Systems is pitching to the US Army as a new short-range air-defense system., Joseph Trevithick And unless the launching aircraft is also a low observable design, it may have to release the drones from safely outside an enemy air defense net. Depending on how far inside the denied area the target or targets might be this could then significant limit Dash X’s ability to offer persistent coverage of a particular point or reduce the time it has to search around. Still, as a disposable system, Dash X could be relatively low cost in its final form, which might help mitigate some of these issues. Replacing the air-dropped “bomb” idea with a dispenser containing a drone fitted inside an air- or surface-launched cruise missile or glide weapon could give the concept extra stand-off distance. Even if they detect the drone swarm, an enemy force might find themselves overwhelmed and unable to shoot down some or all of the unmanned aircraft before they can grab any important imagery or other intelligence information. This is one the main benefits of a swarming concept to begin with. There’s no guarantee that the Navy or any other service will even decide to turn the experiment into a fully fledged acquisition effort. ONR has already been experimenting with swarms of small, disposable drones for some time . The Office of the Secretary of Defense’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are also heavily invested in researching the potential applications of swarms and manned-unmanned teaming more broadly. The results of the Dash X tests could end up as part of that growing corpus of basic research data to support future developments. As it stands now, Northrop Grumman still has to prove its basic concept works and it can drop the Dash X out of a modified cluster bomb.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Could Microwave Cruise Missiles or F-35s Really Stop North Korean Missile Tests?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The world is still reeling from North Korea’s latest and highly impressive missile test . It isn’t surprising that everyone seems to have a take on the issue, but that doesn’t mean all those takes are really based in reality. Two stories that have been parroted extensively in both defense media and the mainstream media this week have to do with supposedly innovative ways the U.S. could destroy or disable North Korean ballistic missiles during or before entering their boost phase. One has to do with the use of a cruise missile armed with a microwave pulse emitter that would zap a missile’s electronics and the other has to do with a fighter jet, namely an F-35, actually shooting down a missile with an AIM-120 AMRAAM as it rises towards the heavens. Although both stories make for great headlines, they are in many ways detached from reality. North Korean missile mitigation like a CHAMP? This story seems to have originated on the NBC Nightly News and from an associated print report that appeared online on December 4th. It describes how a relatively new technology could be used to zap North Korean missiles in a non-kinetic attack—one that wouldn’t kill any human beings in the process. The report states that the capability came up last August in a White House meeting on what to do about North Korea and their ongoing missile and nuclear development programs. The story states in part: Could a high-power microwave weapon actually be used against North Korea? Deptula said he believed the U.S. could use an HPM to disable a ballistic missile on a North Korean launch pad, and that there are many advantages to using microwave weapons in a North Korean scenario. They work in all weather, said Deptula, which helps in the Korean climate, and “they’re employed at the speed of light. You can’t get much faster than that in terms of achieving desired effects.” Of course microwave weaponry isn’t really anything new. The Counter-Electronics High-Power Advanced Microwave Project (CHAMP) has been ongoing for many years now, and I did a detailed feature on the program back in 2015. The original NBC report is right in describing the weapons basic concept. This is how I described it previously: The whole idea behind CHAMP is to be able to destroy an enemy’s command, control, communication and computing, surveillance and intelligence (C4SI) capabilities without doing any damage to the people or traditional infrastructure in and around it. In other words, it can eliminate a facility’s effectiveness by destroying the electronics within it alone, via a microwave pulse, without kinetically attacking the facility itself. Think of it as the mother of all less than lethal weapons. The effects of a CHAMP are very similar to what would happen during an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) caused by a high-altitude nuclear detonation or by a powerful solar storm, just on a much smaller, more focused scale. Unlike an EMP bomb, which are area weapons and indiscriminate as to who they target within their blast area, CHAMP is really an EMP assassin that comes in and surgically eliminates an enemy’s war enabling technology, barely leaving a fingerprint it was ever even there… … CHAMP will be a ‘first day of war’ standoff weapon that can be launched outside an enemy’s area-denial/anti-access capabilities, and fly a route over known C4SI facilities, zapping them along its way, before destroying itself at the end of its mission. Because of its stealth design, long-range and is expendable, it will fly where no other assets could and because it does not blow anything up, its use does not necessarily give away the fact that the enemy is under direct attack in the first place. In that sense, it is a psychological weapon, capable of at least partially blinding an enemy before they even know that a larger-scale attack is coming. CHAMP may have trouble knocking out the most hardened enemy electronic systems, but their sensors are possibly another story. Command and control components and sensors used at surface-to-air missile sites and for integrated air defense system connectivity could be put at great risk… A few years ago, CHAMP was supposedly migrating from its previous platform, an AGM-86 Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), to the Air Force’s newest tactical cruise missile, the stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), as well as moving from a analogue architecture to a more capable, compact, and flexible digital one. It isn’t clear exactly how far along that program has gotten with either initiative, but suffice it to say, CHAMP is a real capability that could potentially be deployed in low volume if need be. What followed that NBC report were an avalanche of repostings on the topic, many which featured dubious claims and totally sensational titles. But even the original report raises some eyebrows as to its plausibility. In order to use CHAMP, or a similar system, the U.S. would still have to fire a cruise missile at North Korea. Whereas having surveillance aircraft and unarmed drones entering a foe’s airspace may be provocative, firing a cruise missile at a high-value target will surely be seen as an act of war. If everything goes as planned, that missile could splash down in international waters after its payload causes its electrical mayhem, but there are no guarantees that this will occur. Cruise missiles have become more reliable in over the last few decades, but they still go awry at a substantial rate. Additionally, as even the NBC report points out, the missile would likely have fly very close to the missile for it to have its desired effect. Considering that security is at its very highest, and all eyes are on the missile prior to launch, it’s not as if the screaming sound of a jet powered cruise missile flying just dozens of feet off the ground and right over the focus of everyone’s attention won’t go unnoticed. This is especially true when the lights turn off and key electronic systems fail or go totally haywire immediately following the missile’s pass. AGM-86 CALCM being loaded onto a B-52., USAF There is also the question of when to hit the missile with CHAMP’s microwave pulse. The idea presented is that it would be struck when the missile is on its launch table. This would require time sensitive targeting and a very truncated kill chain to accomplish. Detecting the missile’s position pre-launch is one thing , and even surveilling it visually prior to being fired is a shadowy but established capability . But surveillance and strike are two different things. Having an aircraft loaded with this exotic weapon and timing the cruise missile launch so that it makes it to its target at subsonic speeds before the missile is fired is problematic and rife with unknowns. Not to mention hitting the missile with a massive electronic pulse while it is being fueled or is fueled could possibly result in just as disastrous an explosion than if it were attacked directly via more traditional “kinetic” means. AGM-86 ALCM being moved for maintenance. , USAF All this adds up to what is clearly an unattractive, if not somewhat implausible, option for dealing with North Korea’s missile tests. Standoff jamming and cyber attacks, especially targeting the data-links and radar that provide North Korean scientists with missile telemetry, onboard diagnostic information, and video seems like a much more attractive option when it comes to applying a non-invasive tactic aimed at slowing the rogue state’s missile development momentum. Another option could exist that would make use of a high-powered microwave weapon less risky and more plausible. If this technology has been adapted clandestinely by the USAF or the CIA to be placed on an unmanned aircraft—especially one that can penetrate and loiter over enemy airspace undetected for long periods of time—most of the tactical and operational issues related to CHAMP could be overcome. Of course both the USAF and the CIA have an aircraft that can do just that in the RQ-170 Sentinel , which has supposedly been deployed to the Pacific and supposedly to the Korean Peninsula in the past. And really, gathering intelligence of nuclear and missile proliferation and monitoring rogue regimes are all part of the flying wing’s core mission set. So it is more likely than not that it has flown sorties over North Korea and likely continues to do so. An RQ-170 at Andersen AFB, Guam., USAF via FOIA Watching missile development sites and tests at close range is also right up the RQ-170’s alley, and we know that the US has had “eyes on” these events in the past as we me mentioned earlier. We have also written about reports of exotic electromagnetic weapons being used on battlefields in the Middle East and Africa for similar purposes. If a similar microwave pulse capability, maybe even one using a more flexible AESA array as an emitter, has been miniaturized and adapted as a payload for unmanned aircraft, then it would represent a far more attractive non-kinetic solution for sabotaging North Korea’s missile launched than using CHAMP. And considering an RQ-170, or similar stealthy drone would possibly be already overhead, putting such a payload to use seems like a logical and less risky step. Such a capability could be factored into North Korea’s launch plans though, as they have been testing their missiles just outside of Pyongyang as of late, instead of at various remote locations around the country as in the past. The North Korean capital’s airspace is the most heavily defended in all of North Korea, with the country’s most potent fighter aircraft—aging MiG-29s—and surface-to-air missiles being based there. Still, heavily defended airspace hasn’t stopped the RQ-170 from operating before, as it was used to survey some of Iran’s most sensitive nuclear sites as well as infiltrate deep into Pakistani airspace to watch Bin Laden pace around in his courtyard. And we do know that there is a discreet test site based in the highly secured Nevada Test and Training Range for exotic unmanned aircraft payload testing. Adapting a highly directional microwave weapon, even one that doesn’t possess CHAMP’s power, to be used on a reusable and hard to detect unmanned aircraft would likely be at the top of the CIA and/or the Pentagon’s wishlist. And there is undoubtedly major clandestine initiatives regarding similar capabilities underway. But still, we can’t be certain if anything like this is fielded in an operational form. Eventually a laser toting, high-flying drone should be able to knock North Korea’s missiles out of the sky during their boost stage, but that capability won’t be ready for half a decade or more at the very least. It may be possible to put a much lower-power laser on a penetrating drone before then—one that is capable of disabling or destroying a North Korean missile on the pad or during launch, albeit at much closer range—but even that is likely outside the realm of possibility at this time. Regardless of these other theoretical possibilities, the idea that a CHAMP wielding cruise missile is some new panacea for North Korea’s missile program doesn’t hold water, and it’s frustrating seeing so many outlets depicting it otherwise without giving it any critical thought whatsoever. Swatting down North Korean missiles like Lightning? Another idea that has been gaining surprising traction in the media involves using F-35 Joint Strike Fighters armed with regular AIM-120 air-to-air missiles to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles during their boost phase right after launch. It’s attractive idea, in theory, since it would neutralize the missiles at their most vulnerable point, when they are still moving relatively slowly and the rocket motor is burning steadily, making them inherently easier to track and intercept. In November 2017, Duncan Hunter, a Republican Representative from California, highlighted the concept of using F-35s and AIM-120s, also known as the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile or AMRAAM, as a potential near-term solution to the North Korean missile threat, citing unspecified studies from the U.S. government’s Los Alamos National Laboratories and other groups. On Dec. 5, 2017, Northrop Grumman disclosed the results of one such test, known as FTX-20, to a group of journalists at the firm’s offices in Linthicum, Maryland. “It’s like an act of God,” Hunter had said at a missile-defense conference in Washington, D.C., in November. “You have F-35s, you have AMRAAMs, and you can shoot these things down as they go up.” USAF On Oct. 16, 2014, Northrop Grumman and the Missile Defense Agency demonstrated the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System, or DAS, ability to detect and track a ballistic missile immediately after launch using a surrogate aircraft with the same equipment. DAS consists of six cameras positioned around the Joint Strike Fighter that give the pilot 360 degrees of situation awareness and project an image on their helmet-mounted display that allows them to “see” in all directions, even “through” the aircraft itself. The system, with its always watching “stitched together” panoptic sphere of vision, also can detect potential threats and can even identify targets autonomously, cueing the jet’s higher fidelity sensors to those objects. During the experiment, the test aircraft then shared its information with other sensor nodes to accurately show the ballistic missile’s most likely trajectory. According to the Virginia-headquarters defense contractor, this data could then aid space-based assets in tracking the missile as it continued on its way or help cue interceptors on the ground or at sea. “You can give that information to a shooter,” John Montgomery, a business development manager with Northrop’s Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance & Targeting Division, told reporters, according to Defense One . “That shooter now has information to go and put his information in the right place. Thus the radar doesn’t have to search. It goes, ‘I know where it is, it’s right there.’” One logical extension of the concept would be to simply have the F-35 use that data itself to cue up its own AIM-120s or future air-to-air missiles. The up-coming AIM-120D—and likely any similar weapon going forward—will feature a two-way data link that will allow pilots, and even third party sensor sources, to feed it course-corrections and keep an eye on its progress during the engagement, thus further improving the probability of scoring a kill. But despite what Representative Hunter and other supporters of this idea might hope, this concept is still very far away from ever being a reliable method of intercepting a ballistic missile. Northrop Grumman itself said that they had waited so long to disclose the results of the FTX-20 experiment because they weren’t entirely sure the outcome was actually significant. “We wanted to get our understanding of how this could change the battlefield,” Montgomery said. “We’ve since done a series of modeling and [simulation] events and teamed with other governmental partners and industry.” This particular ballistic missile defense scheme might work well in a laboratory environment, but that’s no guarantee it will work under real world conditions. At present, the concept Northrop Grumman described requires a significant number of assets to be well situated near the launch site in advance. For one, the plan requires two F-35s, not one, to be within range to use the DAS. The pair is necessary in order to actually fix the likely trajectory, something one of the stealthy fighter jets can’t do on its own. In 2012, testing did demonstrate a single Joint Strike Fighter’s basic ability to use the system to spot and track a moving ballistic missile, which could help cue the a single jet’s radar onto the target in an attempt to track it three dimensionally. If the planes were to engage the target themselves, they would similarly have to be close enough to fire their own missiles at it. Depending on the launch site, this could require getting deep into the range of North Korea’s dense air defense networks, which aren’t entirely as dated as many believe . The F-35 is low observable, but that doesn’t mean it is invisible to radar—especially from its rear aspect. SAM systems operating on longer wave lengths could potentially detect the stealth jets orbiting overhead waiting for a launch to occur. The boost phase window varies from missile to missile, but its typically less than five minutes, and the opportunity for a successful engagement will be far shorter than that. This could require pairs of F-35s to be in the air, or at least on very short notice alert, to have even a chance to strike, a potentially demanding and costly proposition. Just locating where the launch would occur would have to happen fairly rapidly via the ornate menagerie of reconnaissance platforms that keep an eye on North Korea day in and day out. F-35Bs carried live AIM-120s when escorting a B-1 on a show of force mission very near the North Korean border. , USMC “You’d have to get very lucky,” Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on missiles and nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California told Motherboard . The overall idea is “cray cray,” he added. The reality is that an AIM-120 has a fairly short burn time before it relies on its inertia to cruise to its target, meaning that it hits peak speed and altitude quickly and then it’s all downhill from there. On the other hand, a ballistic missile does the opposite. It’s like a freight train getting up to speed, starting out very slowly and building in speed and altitude as time ticks on. As such, an F-35 would have to be nearby and able to get a track on the missile right as it begins its ascent for an AIM-120 to have any shot at actually catching it on its way up into the upper atmosphere. It might be more feasible to use the F-35 and the capability offered by the DAS to act as a sensor node feeding additional information to Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships or Ground-based Midcourse Defense interceptors. It still wouldn’t necessarily help if those assets weren’t already properly positioned to intercept the missile as it flew toward its final target, and the U.S. has spaced-based assets to quickly detect and track missiles in their boost stages anyways. So this just isn’t that feasible. Future air-to-air weapons, such as the very long-range boosted variety , or even MBDA’s Meteor with its throttleable ramjet engine to small degree, would have a better shot of executing such a demanding task. And we are just talking about intercepting test launches of immature missile systems here, not of operational road mobile ones, or even those that feature feature solid fuel and can be setup and launched within a matter of minutes, not hours. So even the thought of using this type of idea as an operational counter to a North Korean ballistic missile barrage is laughable. USAF Beyond that, there’s just a political dimension. As noted, a boost-phase intercept over North Korea could involve flying over the country in most cases. Kim Jong Un and his regime in Pyongyang already routinely accusing the United States and its allies of plotting invade the country and assassinate him and other leadership figures. Not to mention that Chinese and Russian governments already complain about American ballistic missile defenses sprouting up near their borders. More worryingly, a pair of F-35s, or more, shooting down a ballistic missile would be a powerful statement, but it is also one the North Koreans could interpret as an act of war, touching off what almost everyone agrees would be a disastrous conflict for everyone involved. If nothing else it would vindicate the regime’s defiant and belligerent position and could give them a propaganda victory, especially if innocent civilians find themselves caught in the crossfire, injured or killed by falling missile parts. And what if the F-35s miss? Even if the launch was just a test, it would be humiliating for the United States to have its most advanced aircraft appear impotent in the face of North Korea’s rapidly advancing ballistic missile technology. It would be another blow to an already rickety ballistic missile defense “shield” that has yet to conclusively prove itself in anything approaching a real world situation, as well. So, while it might not be impossible, the idea of using F-35s to shoot down North Korea’s ballistic missiles isn’t that plausible. It also relies heavily on having right pieces in the right places at the right time, and there is significant risk in doing that even before a trigger is pulled. And even if the plan worked as intended, the backlash could easily make a bad situation far, far worse.

When most people think of a the Panavia Tornado today the interdiction/strike (IDS) or electronic countermeasures/reconnaissance (ECR) variants come to mind. But the air defense variant (ADV) of the swing-wing Cold War era combat jet lived an entirely different life than its non air-to-air focused cousins. These jets were interceptors optimized primarily to efficiently hunt down and destroy Soviet bombers over long ranges, and their maneuverability was notoriously lacking when compared to fighters of the same era. But after some major developmental hurdles, the jet’s straight line performance, Foxhunter radars, and Skyflash missiles proved to be a deadly combination, especially when paired with a very well trained aircrew. Phil Keeble was a pilot flying the Tornado ADV F3 during the waning days of the Cold War.

The F125’s large silhouette features two pyramid-like superstructures that were designed with survivability in mind. For instance, they both carry components of the ship’s primary combat radar system, so if one structure is damaged the ship won’t be completely “blinded.” The low-observable sensor masts are modular in nature and can be reconfigured with new communications gear and sensors fairly easily. The overall design is based around a requirement for reduced radar cross-section and acoustic signature. There are also areas for two containerized mission packages amidships as well. This concept has failed America’s Littoral Combat Ships , but the F125’s modules will likely be less heavily integrated into the ship, and as a result they may be less potent, especially for high-end combat missions. But that’s really not what this vessel is all about—a key detail which we will get to in a moment. Baden-Wurttemberg under construction., Dirtsc/wikicommons For such a large combat vessel, its crew complement is very small. Even though the F125s have twice the displacement of the F122s they replace, they have a core complement of just half the size, or 110-120 sailors. As mentioned earlier, a huge focus of the F125’s design has been on automation that will supposedly allow such a tiny crew to safely operate the ship. America’s Littoral Combat Ships were also designed around the same idea, but the U.S. Navy has had to add a sizable number of crew to their complements due to the inability for the ship to be operated and sustained by such a small force. There is room for at least 50 additional personnel on the F125s even after a small air wing component is also added. This extra space is intended for special operations forces, should they be needed, or mission specialists, or other temporarily deployed personnel. But this extra space could end up being used at least partially by additional core crewmen if the current complement can’t keep up with the extreme endurance operations the ship is intended for. The driving operational concept for the ship, which dictated its large design, is based around the idea that the vessel could deploy far from home for two years at a time—yes you read that right—and persist even in taxing hot tropical conditions. A target of 208 days at sea a year, or 5,000 hours, is what the German Navy can supposedly squeeze out of these giant frigates. Eight crews will be spread across a fleet of four ships and would be swapped out every four months, with those the relieving crew meeting the ships wherever they may be forward deployed to around the globe. The Type 122 Bremen class (F122) that the F125 will replace, at least partially., USN The F125 is intended to call on far less ports, far less often, than its predecessor, with long stretches of sea time between pier-side resupply and maintenance. In other words, these vessels are supposed to run very reliably and the crews are need to be highly self sufficient and efficient for the concept to actually pay off. For its large size, the F125s pack a very soft bite. Originally the vessels were slated to bristle with a version of the German Army’s M270 multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) and a PzH-2000 155mm howitzer . These weapons were eventually passed over due to integration costs. Now the ships are armed with eight aging RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, a 127mm lightweight Otobreda deck gun with guided VULCANO ammunition for shore and land attack. The gun’s guided shells can supposedly reach out to about 60 miles. Seven remote-controlled gun stations are also present. Two are 27mm MLG27 auto-cannons, and five are .50 caliber machine guns on Hitrole-NT mounts. Two other .50 caliber machine guns can be setup for force protection needs, but they are manually operated. Four deployable small boats can be launched via gantries that extend out from bay doors located between the ship’s island superstructures. Finally, air defense comes in the form of two 21 cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile close-in weapons system (CIWS) turrets. Aside from their ability to knock down incoming missiles, drones, and aircraft at close range, the RIM-116 can also be used against maneuvering surface threats in most conditions. MASS decoy launchers are also installed fore and aft, but we still don’t have a clear idea as to what electronic warfare systems the ship has for self protection, if any. A pair of NH-90 Sea Lion multi-purpose twin-engine helicopters can be carried. Presumably unmanned aircraft can also be deployed and recovered from the F125’s flight deck as well. Ein Dahmer/wikicommons What’s critically lacking here is any sort of area air defense capability. Not to mention any organic anti-submarine weaponry beyond the two potentially embarked helicopters. The ship lacks any type of anti-submarine sonar as well. For such a large surface combatant, lacking some sort of air defense capability beyond close-in weapon systems seems outright bizarre, especially considering the ship’s capable sensor suite. The latest Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) would be especially well suited for this design as they could use the ship’s radar and data-links, instead of discreet target illuminators, to engage targets well beyond visual range. This is especially concerning because non-state actors are increasingly getting their hands on anti-ship missiles. Even a top-of-the-line U.S. destroyer fired two SM-2s and an ESSM, as well as launching decoys and activating its very capable electronic warfare suite, at an incoming missile fired from Yemeni shores and they still don’t know if these systems took it down or if it crashed on its own accord. And this occurred in a relatively a low-threat combat environment. In the case of the F125, just watching a missile approach before it can be engaged just a couple miles away at best by a RIM-116 seems almost reckless, especially for such a prominent target. Once again, the F125’s lack of area air defense is a similar controversy that plagued the Littoral Combat Ship , and they are half the size and roughly half the cost of the F125. They are also far more nimble. Its predecessor, the F122 class, had an eight cell RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile launcher for medium-range air defense, as well as multiple torpedo tubes and sonar for anti-submarine warfare. In addition to its traditional weaponry, special emphasis was put on equipping these ships with “less-than-lethal” defensive systems, such as diver detection sensors, powerful water cannons, blinding spot lights, acoustic access denial devices and other systems. So you are probably asking yourself by now “what the hell is this ship intended for?” You wouldn’t be the first wonder. The German Navy has a somewhat controversial mission set defined for these vessels. The Baden-Wurttemberg class is supposed to be used to countering “asymmetric” threats and to perform “stabilization, crisis management, conflict prevention, and international intervention” operations. In other words, these ships are meant to be used in low-threat environments against enemies with rudimentary combat capabilities at best. Disaster relief and emergency aid are also at the center of their intended uses. So think special operations support nearby very poor countries or counter-terror and counter-piracy operations in remote regions of the world. The ships could be integrated into a coalition flotilla in higher-threat combat arenas, but that’s not its primary operational format and what use they could be such instances is debatable. Although those missions do matter, does building destroyer-sized ships to focus on them alone really make sense, especially considering these ships are replacing more plentiful and more traditional multi-role surface combatants? And that’s the multi-billion dollar question here. On one hand Germany could be seen as just being realistic about the low-end missions they will need to fulfill for decades to come. On the other hand they sure went above and beyond to satisfy those limited mission sets. And does building four of these large but limited capability ships even make sense for a navy that has only roughly a dozen major surface combatants (and about a half dozen corvettes) in all? Additionally, the whole automation and minimally manned crew concept is a risky one, especially for a ship that is supposed to operate so far from home for such long stretches of time. If anything, the latest incidents aboard America’s top-of-the-line Arleigh Burke class destroyers underlines the personnel and readiness issues that can exist even on constantly deployed ships that are traditionally staffed and have extensive support infrastructure in their operating region. Keeping a ship up while also operating it with a skeleton crew on a daily basis far from home, even if all the automation works as advertised, is a highly challenging if not questionable proposition. And if the F125 frigates require more in-port time to sustain their high-operations tempo, either abroad or at home, this will degrade the reasoning behind the entire design. What’s even more concerning is that there are already issues with this class of ships that could have massive impact on their ability to carry out their mission and to evolve over time. A chronic list of 1.3 degrees to starboard has been documented, but another issue with these vessels will likely have a much larger impact on their relevance over time—they are severely over weight. A Reuters report from May of 2017 details how the ships are heavy by 178 tonnes—or 356,000 pounds. Not only will this impact the vessel’s performance and increase its operating costs, but it will also severely limit future upgrades, and may even impact its ability to field containerized mission modules as it was originally designed to do. Above all else, this issue could preclude the ship from ever receiving enhancements that will add to its lethality and survivability—namely the addition of an area air defense capability. Matthias Süßen/wikicommons But that may not even be possible as it currently stands. There doesn’t seem to be enough internal volume to add a vertical launch system in back of the ship’s main gun. Some sort of containerized version could possibly be used where the mission modules are intended to be placed, but it isn’t clear if doing so would be complicated by the ship’s structure and menagerie of antennas and masts. A Mk48 or Mk56 modular vertical launch system installation is another option in this area, but once again, with little reserve mass left, this may not be feasible without other major alternations that would sacrifice established capabilities. And this would likely mean at least one mission module would be eliminated. MK48 Mod4 VLS seen installed on the Japanese destroyer Ikazuch (DD-107)., Yasu Osugi/wikicommons With the Baden-Wurttemberg class being the largest surface combatant in the German Navy, even dwarfing the far more capable F124 Sachsen class , of which only three of the planned four ships were procured, it can be argued that the funds used on the F125s could have been better suited procuring more F124s which aren’t all that much more expensive. Then again, the fact that Germany is dedicating roughly one third of its surface combatant fleet to a low-end and even non-combative mission says a lot as to what the country sees as to their future role on the high seas and on the national security world stage. But still, it seems like the size of these vessels may be a mismatch to that need. And if it turns out they cannot deploy for the huge stretches of time, a key factor that dictated their unique design, and their crew size ends up being too small to actually sustain its intended operational concept, than the expenditure to buy and the operating costs of these vessels may be tough to justify. So what do you think? Are the F125s visionary ships designed around the realities of our times, or are they oversized and toothless vessels with a questionable mission set?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 16, 2017",Boeing Defense Teases Mystery Aircraft Unveiling By Hiding It Under A Black Sheet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing Defense posted a provocative Tweet today showing what appears to be a new aircraft design under a big black sheet with the teaser “Robust? Check. Ready? Check. Changing future air power? Check it out! See the reveal 12/19! # PhantomWorks” on their Twitter account. Phantom Works is the company’s secretive leading-edge design house that is modeled roughly on Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works. New military aircraft unveils can come with all the glitz and glamour of a new car model unveil, but what’s different here is there seems to be nothing definitively known about this new aircraft or its origins at this time. At first glance, this aircraft looks like a derivative of Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Dreamchaser orbiter—a space faring aircraft design that has roots dating back to the dawn of manned spaceflight (make sure to read all about bizarre lineage in this past feature of mine). But Boeing isn’t part of that program and it would seem somewhat odd to shoehorn a similar program into the defense space alone, although it is possible. Boeing has a very unique past with reusable orbiter type space vehicles, having brought the X-37B to life for the Pentagon, and the company has an even longer history with the Space Shuttle. Boeing acquired the Space Shuttle’s original manufacturer Rockwell in 1996. Maybe Boeing is going to attempt to field a very similar product aimed solely at the defense sector. Boeing has also been chosen by the Pentagon’s “bleeding edge” research and development arm DARPA to build a new revolutionary spaceplane-like system called the XS-1 . It is possible that this aircraft has something to do with this program, even if it is just in a scaled down risk-reduction or technology demonstrator form. The thing is that this could be something totally unrelated to space as well. We are viewing the aircraft from behind, and although its canted wings/control surfaces look very thick, they could be all maneuvering. Also its twin nose wheel front gear and relatively heavy looking main gear could also be a tell as to its intended mission. Boeing blazed major trails in the early to mid 2000s proving the advanced unmanned combat air vehicle concept with the company’s X-45 demonstrators. They followed up with their promising X-45C Phantom Ray UCAV prototype, which was by all accounts very capable and stealthy. Boeing appeared to be pioneering the biggest revolution in air combat since the jet engine—that is until the USAF’s interest in the groundbreaking capability seemed to evaporate suddenly. We have written about this astonishing phenomenon, its massive repercussions, and the highly classified world of UCAV development in this must-read special feature . There has been some recent interest from the USAF in lower-end UCAVs , some of which are optionally expendable, and can work as a team with manned fighter aircraft under the “loyal wingman” concept or as swarm with other UCAVs. But so far these contracts have gone to target drone builder Kratos, not Boeing. With this in mind, it’s possible that Boeing is making another pass at the UCAV concept, or at least providing a prototype that could lead to such a capability later on. X-45C Phantom Ray UCAV., Boeing And this is where we come to the possibility that this strangely shaped aircraft is actually a clean-sheet design to fulfill the Navy’s Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) requirement. We still haven’t seen Boeing’s offering for the competition, and seeing that low observability (stealth) was stripped from the program’s requirements, a stranger shaped design that is especially suited for hauling large fuel loads could be realized. With once favored Northrop Grumman out of the picture , Boeing could be eyeing CBARS as a way to finally give them the foothold they need in the high-end unmanned combat aircraft space that could allow them a better shot of fielding more complex UCAVs down the road. Some may think this aircraft has something to do with Boeing’s Aurora Flight Sciences acquisition . Although we can’t count anything out at this point, it seems unlikely. The ducted fan technology primarily being explored by the company under a DARPA initiative in the form of the XV-24A Lightning Strike looks nothing like this. Also the acquisition occurred fairly recently, so it would seem odd that an Aurora Flight Sciences aircraft design would be unveiled in such a manner by Boeing so soon. What do you think it is? Let us know in the comments below. Update 12:28pm PST: You know looking at this again, and considering Boeing’s very long history of stealthy aircraft design (read all about Quiet Bird here , which predates the Skunk Works’s Have Blue design by well over a decade), are we seeing a Bird of Prey like planform here? Could this be a legacy of that 20 year old design?

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2018","Russian Su-25 Almost Hits US F-22 During Intercept Over Syria, But Is There More Going On?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States and Russia are disputing the circumstances of an engagement between combat aircraft from both countries over Syria that almost resulted in a collision, the latest in what the U.S. military says are becoming a steady stream of unprofessional and dangerous aerial incidents . But what makes this new report almost bizarre is the Kremlin’s version of the story is nearly identical to one from weeks earlier that American officials say never occurred, raising the question of whether some portion of these reports may be deliberate misinformation . The basic facts of the new intercept, as much as both sides agree on them, are that a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jammed itself in front of a pair of Russian Air Force Su-25 Frogfoots near the Syrian city of Al Mayadin. The American jet, cutting across the path of the Russian aircraft, dropped decoy flares and possibly chaff in an attempt to get the Russians to change course, a tactic commonly known as “head-butting,” according to Fox News . Similar tactics, also referred to as “thumping” have been used in the past by American fighters during similar incidents over Syria. Beyond that, the United States and Russia have significantly different accounts of what happened and where. The Pentagon says the Russian jets crossed over to the eastern side of the Euphrates River in Syria and either could not or would not respond to radio calls on an emergency channel to leave the area. At present, the United States and Russia officially acknowledge the waterway as a deconfliction boundary between their respective activities in the country. They have agreed that the Russians will stay to the west of the river, while the U.S. military and its partners will stay on the eastern side. “We’re trying to kill ISIS,” Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesperson, told The Washington Post . “But we’re also trying to contend with unsafe interaction with Russian jets.” A Russian Air Force Su-25 Frogfoot. , Vitaly Kuzmin Pahon told multiple outlets that the encounter lasted approximately 40 minutes and that at one point, one of the Frogfoots maneuvered dangerously close to the Raptor almost causing a collision. He added that Russian aircraft violate the deconfliction line between six and eight times a day on average, amounting to approximately 10 percent of their total sorties in Syria. Underscoring the issue, a Russian Su-35S Flanker E fighter jet reportedly crossed the boundary during the other intercept, while a second F-22 shadowed that aircraft’s movement. The Russians deny this version of events. In its own statement , the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Frogfoots had been escorting a humanitarian convoy on the western side of the Eurphrates. The Kremlin says it was actually the F-22 that crossed the deconfliction line to harass its jets. A Russian Air Force Su-35S Flanker E., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP “A Russian Su-35 fighter jet, performing an air cover mission at an altitude of 10,000 meters, swiftly approached the F-22 from the rear,” their statement added. The pilot reportedly succeeded in “forcing the American aircraft to leave the area.” It seems difficult to believe that the pilots in the F-22s did not have an accurate understanding of their position or would have crossed the deconfliction line without any provocation. A weekly intelligence summary from the U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT) Combined Intelligence Fusion Center (CIFC), situated at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, does include a section on GPS jamming. A portion of the table of contents for the CIFC Weekly Intelligence Summary for Dec. 1 to 7, 2016., USAF via FOIA Unfortunately, censored redacted the entire content of those passages, so we have no idea whether or not there have been any actual reported incidents. The United States has not publicly alleged that the Russians, or anyone else in the region, are interfering with coalition operations in Iraq and Syria in this way. There are separate reports of the Kremlin blocking or confusing the satellite navigation system in Europe, though. Also the F-22’s navigation suite is very capable, and like most all modern combat aircraft, it doesn’t rely on GPS alone. Its ring-laser-gyro inertial navigation system can work effectively without GPS. Other sensors, including the aircraft’s AN/APG-77 AESA radar and ALR-94 electronic support measures suite can can help in geolocating targets and to figure out the place in space and time the F-22 occupies in relation to its surrounding environment. Regardless of what details are right or wrong in this case, it does seem clear that these incidents are becoming increasingly common. However, that doesn’t mean that we should expect them to play out the same way every time. So, it seems particularly noteworthy that the Russian government alleges that American pilots were responsible for another incident on Nov. 23, 2017 that was functionally identical to the one on Dec. 13, 2017. An F-22 Raptor., USAF It is hard to stress just how similar the Kremlin’s versions of events are in both cases. Major-General Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry’s spokesperson, said that in the November intercept, an F-22 had head-butted a pair of Su-25s west of the Euphrates as they attempted to attack an ISIS position near Al Mayadin. Again, a Su-35S reportedly drove off the American stealth fighter. To make matters even more curious, in a statement to the Aviationist’s David Cenciotti, a public affairs officer for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the top U.S.-led command in charge of the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, stated categorically that this earlier incident never even happened . “There is no truth to this allegation,” they said. “According to our flight logs for Nov 23, 2017, this alleged incident did not take place, nor has there been any instance where a Coalition aircraft crossed the river without first deconflicting with the Russians via the deconfliction phone line set up for this purpose.” At the time, it seemed that Major-General Konashenkov’s remarks, which he made on Dec. 12, 2017, were just a response to a story from The New York Times highlighting Russia’s increasing violations of the deconfliction arrangement in Syria. Now, one has to wonder if he was somehow attempting to set the stage to challenge the veracity of American claims in future incidents. The only significant difference between the two Russian allegations is what the Su-25s were doing during the incidents. Konashenkov comments implied that the United States has actually been working with ISIS, a long-standing and completely unfounded conspiracy theory. Russian personnel prep an Su-25 in Syria., Vadim Grishankin/Russian Federation Press Service via AP The new report would seem to assert that the U.S. military is seeking to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian relief. The basic underlying accusation is functionally the same though, painting the United States and its partners as actors that do not care for the Syrian people and that are actively working to destroy their livelihoods. These elements by themselves are typical of the kind of information warfare that has become a hallmark of the modern Russian way of war. This includes a concept known as maskirovka , which translates variously to “masking” or “camouflaging,” which refers to a more complex set of tactics to obscure the situation both on and off the battlefield to help achieve a certain policy objective. You can read a more detailed breakdown of Russian “hybrid” or “new generation” here . “It’s become increasingly tough for our pilots to discern whether Russian pilots are deliberately testing or baiting us into reacting, or if these are just honest mistakes,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesperson, told The Times for their December 2017 article. “The greatest concern is that we could shoot down a Russian aircraft because its actions are seen as a threat to our air or ground forces.” Of course, it could just as easily be that these incidents are routine enough that the details Konashenkov gave, whether real or fabricated, are just that likely to repeat themselves. We at The War Zone have written extensively in the past on the steadily increasingly potential for a dangerous skirmish between American and Russian forces in Syria, or among their respective local partners . This has hardly been idle speculation. In June 2017, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Arab Air Force Su-22 Fitter ground attack jet after it attacked U.S.-backed Syrian Defense Forces. It’s also not the first time F-22s have come to the rescue to drive potentially hostile jets away from friendly positions. The hard to detect aircraft have played the role somewhat akin to an invisible referee over Syria’s convoluted skies. The Russians probably find their ability to evade detection frustrating if not a bit unnerving. The precariousness of the situation has only become more pronounced as ISIS has suffered increasing defeats, leaving a power vacuum, particularly in Syria, filled with a number of desperate factions, each with their own agendas. Confusing and conflicting reports about the U.S. government’s intentions in the Syria and the region as a whole have only exacerbated these issues. And despite declaring total victory against its enemies in Syria and withdrawing some of its forces, Russia remains an active participant in the ongoing conflict. Emboldened by its recent successes, Moscow has been increasingly active in pushing its own agendas and continually seeking to challenge and undermine America’s position in the Middle East as a whole . It will be interesting to see if reports of more nearly identical aerial incidents begin to emerge as American and Russian forces find themselves in increasingly close contact amid the steadily evolving character of the fighting in Syria.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 14, 2017",Could “Phantom Swift” Be The Aircraft Boeing Defense Is Set To Reveal Next Week?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our minds have been racing since Boeing Defense posted a tweet on Thursday showing a black cloth draped mystery aircraft with the text “Robust? Check. Ready? Check. Changing future air power? Check it out! See the reveal 12/19! # PhantomWorks.” We followed up quickly with a post detailing some possibilities as to what’s under that black sheet, but a discussion in our forum prompted me to look up a research and development project I hadn’t heard about for some time—the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) “Phantom Swift.” Phantom Swift is indeed a Boeing Phantom Works program that was being developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the VTOL X-Plane competition. In 2013, this is how Boeing described the endeavor: “The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is looking for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that can fly fast, hover efficiently and carry a lot of cargo. Thanks to rapid prototyping, a team of Boeing Phantom Works engineers in Philadelphia designed and built a flying subscale model of the innovative Phantom Swift in time to be part of Boeing’s proposal for DARPA’s vertical takeoff and landing X-Plane competition.” The design leverages two large fans buried in the aircraft’s fuselage to provide vertical lift and a pair of swiveling wingtip fans for stability and control during hover and for propulsion during forward flight. The idea is to have one or two General Electric CT7-8 turbines produce power to drive all these fans electrically, although an early prototype might not include a full hybrid electric drive system. Boeing says this configuration is far more efficient than a normal helicopter and DARPA’s original design goals included hitting speeds beyond 300 knots and carry 4,000lbs. A full size Phantom Swift would be similar in dimensions and weight to a Super King Air. Boeing continued to develop the aircraft with government funds prior to DARPA’s down-select of just one type back in early 2016. That aircraft ended up being Aurora Flight Sciences exotic and highly promising LightningStrike concept . I wrote the following about the program shortly after Aurora Flight Sciences won the chance to build a full-scale prototype: “The idea behind the whole VTOL X-plane initiative is not to put an aircraft into production or to fill a distinct mission set, but to rapidly mature and reduce risk on a package of technologies that could make their way to production aircraft in the not so distant future. And according to Bagai the technology is scalable, both up to much larger aircraft and down to small unmanned system. Clearly the tactical and commercial applications for a LightningStrike craft, that can land virtually anywhere while also being able to fly a near jet speeds are huge.” Just last October Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences, which had already completed sub-scale testing on LightningStrike and is currently working to build the full-sized version of the concept known as the XV-24A . But it is possible that even though Phantom Swift originally lost the DARPA X-Plane competition, Boeing may have continued to internally fund development of the design on a parallel timetable as DARPA’s program. Boeing has done this before with their X-45C Phantom Ray UCAV , among other initiatives, and clearly rotorless VTOL flight—especially using hybrid gas-electric propulsion—is one of the most promising future of flight technologies. With that in mind, having two radically different designs now in development within the company’s portfolio could drastically increase the potential of grabbing marketshare early on and would abate some risk if one of the two concepts doesn’t pan out during testing. Also, it’s likely that one design will be better suited for certain tasks than the other an vice-versa. As you can see in the tweeted image above, the latest known configuration of the Phantom Swift, sure resembles what’s poking up under Boeing’s black sheet. With the top inlet doors closed the form factor of its fuselage looks pretty similar and the V-tails being as thick as they are, the aircraft’s wings could be entirely blocked in the teaser video. As for the stout landing gear, well VTOL is a rough and tough business. The applications of a full-sized operational Phantom Swift are nearly endless, and the DoD is already spending big bucks trying to get similar technology operational on the high seas and over land. This isn’t to say that this is a definitive dead-ringer for what’s shown in the teaser video, but it does check a lot of boxes and would definitely be worth the hype that the Phantom Works is putting on the unveil. Still, it could end up being a totally new concept, Boeing’s entrant into the Navy’s CBARS tanker competition, or a whole host of other possibilities. If Boeing self-funded a full scale Phantom Swift and still bought Aurora Flight Sciences it would be abundantly clear that the company is going all-in on the future of VTOL flight that doesn’t include big, exposed, whirling rotors, and the limitations that go along with them. Boeing will unveil their mystery aircraft on December 19th.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2020",Lockheed Likely Sees Big Military Applications Potential In Aerion’s Supersonic Bizjet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has formally announced it is teaming up with Aerion Corporation to build the world’s first supersonic business jet, which would be the company’s first passenger aircraft produced in more than three decades. The plane, named AS2 and looks like an F-104 Starfighter and 727 airliner had a child, could potentially revolutionize private and possibly commercial air travel. But what’s not being talked about is that it could also have major military applications as well. On Dec. 15, 2017, Lockheed Martin and Aerion released a joint statement outlining a plan to spend the next year developing the framework for a full partnership, to include engineering and design work, moving prototypes through various certification processes, and serial production of the final aircraft. In May 2017, General Electric signed a similar deal regarding development and production of the aircraft’s powerful engines. “This relationship is absolutely key to creating a supersonic renaissance,” Aerion’s chairman Robert Bass said in the press release. “When it comes to supersonic know-how, Lockheed Martin’s capabilities are well known, and, in fact, legendary. We share with Lockheed Martin a commitment to the long-term development of efficient civil supersonic aircraft.” “Following our initial review of Aerion’s aerodynamic technology, our conclusion is that the Aerion AS2 concept warrants the further investment of our time and resources,” Orlando Carvalho, the Executive Vice President of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, added in the statement. “We are committed to remaining on the cutting edge of aerospace technology and are excited to examine the contribution we might make to working with Aerion on making aviation history.” Aerion As it stands now, Aerion is envisioning its AS2 as a triple-engine jet that will be able to supercruise for long periods of time at a speed of up to Mach 1.4. The corporation has presented art depicting high- and low-wing designs with the engines clustered toward the rear. At a speed of mach 1.4, the AS2 would supposedly have a range of 4,200 nautical miles. At a near supersonic cruising speed of Mach 0.95, it might be able to extend that to 5,400 nautical miles. The corporation has been heavily pitching it initially as a business jet, with possible cabin configurations mirroring typical offerings for such aircraft, featuring a mixture of seats, tables, galleys and bars, or even a stateroom with a bed. Aerion could easily configure this space so the aircraft could serve as small airliner, as well. In 2015, Flexjet announced it had placed an order worth $2.4 billion for 20 AS2s, which would indicate a sales price of around $120 million, or about twice that of a Gulfstream 650. This price may climb, but acquisition cost threshold is likely less of a barrier to success for an aircraft like this than its end-game performance capabilities and operating costs. The bizjet charter service expects deliveries to begin in 2023 and to start offering full service with the type two years after—a highly aggressive if not outright unrealistically optimistic plan, but with the resources of Lockheed Martin now involved, compressing the AS2’s development timetable may be possible. Aerion Aviation firms have been interested in the potential of a civilian supersonic passenger or transport plane since U.S. Air Force legend Chuck Yaeger officially broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 in 1947. The major limiting factors ever since have been the cost to operate such an aircraft and the noise they produce, both during terminal operations and while creating sonic booms while in cruise. The famous Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner , which Air France and British Airways operated from 1976 until 2003, flew often circuitous routes to avoid populated areas. Government subsidies were largely responsible for keeping the aircraft going as long as they did. Aside from the Concorde, and briefly the Soviet Tu-144 , no other civilian supersonic transport initiative has come to frutition. Aerion itself has been working toward its goal of reviving supersonic air travel for more than a decade, announcing plans for its Supersonic Business Jet, or SBJ, in 2004, suggesting the aircraft would be ready to go by 2017 or 2018. In 2014, it unveiled the refined AS2 concept, but has still not produced a prototype. The corporation has worked extensively with NASA on various supersonic design features that would go into the AS2. The most important of these are advanced airframe designs that maintain a steady, aerodynamic flow of air across their surfaces, even at high speeds when turbulence is more likely to occur. In theory, the final aircraft should more efficient and be able to either mitigate the impact of any sonic booms it produces or eliminate them altogether. That last point is particularly important, since the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits civil supersonic air travel over the United States at present and there are similar restrictions in Europe and elsewhere. The interior will have a cabin height of six feet two inches and will rival anything seen on the latest high-end subsonic business jets. This same large interior volume could theoretically be used for militarized systems and gear. , Aerion Aerion says that the AS2, which will be made mostly out of composite materials, will be able to cruise right below the sound barrier, at Mach 0.95, avoiding any sonic booms. On top of that, though, it may be able to reach Mach 1.2, without doing so, “depending on atmospheric conditions, principally temperature and wind,” according to the firm’s website This “boomless cruise” could entirely change the nature of supersonic air travel and Aerion has been advocating for an exemption to FAA restrictions if it can demonstrate the system works. But there looks to still be a long way to go till realizing such a waiver. https://youtube.com/watch?v=UDR2Si9XdVU Aerion had been working with Airbus Defense and Space on the project since the end of 2014 , including on the airframe, the layout of various internal systems, and a conceptual design of the fly-by-wire control system. The European aviation consortium, embroiled in number of corruption allegations that have forced its CEO and COO to resign, has since apparently given up on the project. “We are grateful for Airbus’ contribution to the program,” Brian Barents, Aerion’s Executive Chairman, said in the joint statement with Lockheed Martin. “We could not have moved the program to this stage without their support.” Aerion For its part, GE says that it has settled on configuration for the AS2’s engines, but has yet craft the initial design. A report by FlightGlobal says that the available information points to an engine that mates the GE-developed high-pressure section from the successful CFM56 turbofan to a new low-pressure portion specifically. “A key challenge will be managing the high inlet temperatures of the supersonic engine at high-altitudes,” Brad Mottier, Vice President and General Manager for GE’s Business and General Aviation and Integrated Systems Division, explained, according to FlightGlobal. “This is no easy task, otherwise someone would have done a civil supersonic jet before.” This is where Lockheed Martin comes in. Separate from Aerion and the AS2 effort, the company has been working with NASA on a Quiet Supersonic Technology test bed, otherwise known as QueSST . The goal of that project is to experiment with an aircraft shape that would turn the sonic boom from an aircraft flying at Mach 1.4 at 55,000 feet into nothing more than a perceived “heartbeat” to individuals on the ground. QueSST, NASA NASA and Lockheed Martin completed a preliminary design review of the proposed aircraft, along with sub-scale wind tunnel tests , earlier in 2017. The plan is to have a manned experimental plane in the air by 2021. Between its extensive resources, long-standing experience with supersonic travel – including work on the A-12 and SR-71 spy planes , the proposed L-2000 airliner , various fighter jets, a hypersonic combat aircraft , and likely a slew of other classified projects, not to mention its present work on QueSST, Lockheed Martin is an especially attractive partner for this project. In return, the Maryland headquartered defense and aerospace giant gets a route back into the civil and commercial aviation business that it has largely abandoned since the 1980s after failing to find the success it had hoped for with the L-1011 TriStar. If the two can get AS2 figuratively and literally off the ground, it could be an even more significant event than the introduction of the Lockheed JetStar , the world’s first real business jet type aircraft. And speaking of the JetStar, a Kelly Johnson product, there is certainly some significant parallels here, as the AS2 could also light off a whole new market segment in aviation, similar to the the JetStar’s legacy. And like that aircraft, if the AS2 actually comes to fruition, it will also be very attractive to the United States military. The VC-140—the USAF’s designation for the Lockheed JetStar—ushered in the age of private jet travel. , Museumofaviation.org A large business jet-sized aircraft that can sustain mach 1.4 for thousands of miles would mean a whole series of possibilities for the USAF. Such an airframe could drastically cut transit times over vast distances. If it can be configured for aerial refueled, its impact could be exponentially more severe. The aircraft would be especially useful not just for rapidly deploying small teams of personnel and their gear around the globe for everything from VIP airlift to rapid logistics to emergency response missions, but also for more tactically-oriented tasks such as surveillance and electronic warfare support. The AS2’s unique capabilities tied to these mission sets are uniquely enticing considering the anti-access, area-denial (A2-AD) situations the U.S. and its allies could face in the future. The Gulfstream C-37 (GV) and C-20 (GIII/GIV) have served as the Pentagon’s high-speed, long-range taxis. The AS2 could provide much speedier transport for all but the most long-range transport missions and would be especially useful for special missions., DoD The Pacific region being the biggest challenge, where vast stretches of sea separate key locations and where China is actively building a set of capabilities that could deny American aircraft and naval power from stationing itself within many hundreds, if not thousands of miles of the Chinese mainland. With this in mind, the AS2 could provide high-speed logistics and tactical support throughout such a region, where sustaining widely dispersed operations will be an absolute necessity, not just for success but for survival. AS2s outfitted for electronic warfare support could rush in behind stealthy attack aircraft and provide standoff jamming support and pinpointed cyber attacks during highly coordinated aerial assaults aimed at degrading and eventually destroying parts of the enemy’s anti-access “bubble.” The goal would be to eventually open up a number of sanitized corridors in which more vulnerable fighting forces can move closer toward the enemy’s shores. With an unrefueled combat radius of roughly 2,200 miles, the AS2 could skim the enemy’s outer edges of control on surveillance missions, sucking up key information on their electronic order of battle and peering hundreds of miles into their territory with conformal radar systems. It could dash in and out fast enough so that survivability is ensured. In essence, having near F-22 Raptor-like supercruise ability but over roughly 12 times the sustained distance, the AS2 can “shrink” a theater of operations and bring exciting new tactical and logistical possibilities to the table. There could even be some “kinetic” potential in a strike optimized AS2 variant. By the images released by Aerion, the aircraft looks ideally suited for a weapons bay between the nose wheel gear and the main landing gear—basically where the cabin is located. But even if a relatively tiny set of weapon bay doors or stores ejection system could be fitted into a variant of the type, it could provide a form of regional time sensitive strike capability. And this is a very enticing capability for the U.S. military at this time. Even being able to drop Small Diameter Bomb sized weapons or a single stand-off weapon could provide a flexible and easily deployable quick-strike platform. Aerion If the AS2 enters production, the Lockheed and Aerion will have little trouble selling a sizable amount of them. For the wealthiest people on the planet and for some corporations, time is the most expensive commodity of all, and Aerion is a time machine of sorts. Because it would be much faster than anything else out there, it could make a dent even in the super-sized business jet market currently made up of everything from 737 Boeing Business Jets, to remodeled 757s, to to private 747-8is . Sure a lot of space is nice, but for most missions, getting there nearly twice as fast is nicer. But when it comes to the military, time can mean the difference between life and death, or a slight but critical edge over the enemy, making the AS2 just as relevant in the defense marketplace as the civilian or commercial one. With all this in mind, don’t be surprised if Lockheed’s Skunk Works gets deeply involved in the project. Now we’ll have to see if Lockheed and Aerion can succeed where so many others have failed and deliver a certified supersonic private jet to the elite aircraft marketplace.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 29, 2019",Bell’s V-280 Valor Tilt-Rotor That Aims To Replace The Black Hawk Took Its First Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of work, months of ground tests, as well as recent delays , Bell’s V-280 “Valor” tilt-rotor prototype has crept into the air for the very first time. The historic moment occurred around 2pm local time at the company’s plant in Amarillo, Texas. The flight is said to have lasted around 30 seconds and comes as quite the Christmas gift for the company, which is betting big on the long-term viability of tilt-rotor technology and the Army’s willingness to agree. The aircraft is being developed to compete in the Army’s Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) program, part of the larger Future Vertical Lift (FVL) initiative, and will face off against Sikorsky’s SB>1 “Defiant.” Sikorsky’s concept is radically different than Bells’, featuring a compound coaxial rotor design with a pusher-prop at the back. You can read more about Sikorsky’s Defiant concept in this past feature. Both types aim to drastically improve upon current traditional helicopter performance, with a cruise speed between 250 and 300 knots, and vastly improved range. Both designs have their advantages and disadvantages, with each team digging in for what is going to be a fierce competition. Both manufacturers are already claiming their design is the most capable in various respects. Clearly there are some aspects of each entrant that may be more attractive to the US Army and potentially other Pentagon and foreign users as well. Sikorsky’s concept is closest to a traditional helicopter, and its footprint will be similar as well—something Bell will have trouble claiming. This is especially important when getting in and out of tight spots—something that the H-60 has had to do in combat many times during decades of combat operations. Also the Defiant could scale better, especially for an attack variant . On the other hand, tilt-rotor technology, once seen as a white elephant of the aerospace world, has become a proven commodity for the USMC, and the USAF to a lesser degree. With Japan’s order being in the process of being fulfilled, export success for the V-22 Osprey could still be possible. The Osprey has always been limited in performance due to unique dimensional requirements placed on it by the USMC, something the V-280 won’t have to accommodate. This could potentially open up the tilt-rotor performance envelope like we have never seen it before. Bell said the following in a press release that was posted shortly after the Valor’s first flight: “The Bell V-280 Valor is postured to provide the U.S. Army with the highest levels of maturity and technical readiness. The aircraft is designed to provide the best value in procurement, operations and support, and force structure, while delivering desired leap-ahead performance capabilities with increased maintainability, reliability and affordability to the DoD. With twice the speed and range of conventional helicopters, the Valor is designed to offer maneuver commanders unmatched operational agility to self-deploy and perform a multitude of vertical lift missions currently unachievable in one aircraft. The Bell V-280 is a combat force multiplier with superior performance, payload, survivability, and reliability to give the warfighter the decisive advantage.” Boeing split from its long time tilt-rotor partner, Bell, for the FVL tender, teaming up with Sikorsky (which is now owned by Lockheed) instead. At the time this seemed to be a damning indictment of the V-280 Valor concept and its tilt-rotor technology, but Bell has continued with the program and it has drawn substantial interest from the Pentagon and foreign governments alike. In all reality there isn’t anything to say that there will be the will nor the dollars to purchase large fleets of these more complex, albeit farther and faster flying helicopter alternatives even when their technologies are tested and one is eventually chosen by the Army. If the unit cost is a multiple of the UH-60’s sticker price, one would be hard pressed to see how the Army could afford to replace anywhere near its entire fleet of the H-60s with such a design, regardless of its capability. And even though commonality may be a big driving factor for the Army, other services, not to mention other nations and the commercial market, could find the losing design far more attractive for certain missions. Bell Differences in capabilities may also overcome the Army’s focus on a common platform. For instance, for the attack helicopter and some light tactical transport duties, being as nimble as possible while flying low and slow may give Sikorsky’s concept a great advantage over a tilt-rotor. Long-range transport duties and search and rescue missions may end being better served by the Valor. In the end, we will have to wait and see if there is enough room in the defense marketplace for both designs, or even one at all, but there very well could be in the civilian and commercial space. Still, if either one of these types, or even Sikorsky’s smaller light attack and scout variant of their concept, the S-97 raider , makes it into any sort of production, that concept will have an edge going forward. These are not going to be cheap machines, and any ability to realize reduced costs through production scalability will be a big advantage. We’ll keep a close eye on the V-280’s flight testing as it progresses, and Sikorsky’s Defiant is slated to fly in 2018, but it the S-97 has been in flight testing for some time now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 31, 2018",Israel Is Treating America’s Throwaway F-15D Eagles As New Found Treasure,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Israel Air Force is working hard to regenerate and drastically upgrade nine ex-U.S. Air National Guard F-15Ds that previously served with the 173rd Fight Wing in Klamath Falls, Oregon. As we reported in September of 2016, these aircraft were donated as part of a still active, multi-billion dollar aid package to Israel that was enacted by the Obama Administration. It may seem odd at first that the IAF would want surplus two-seat Eagle models that were originally manufactured in the late 1970s. But these aircraft provide a totally different mission set and value proposition for the Israeli Air Force than they do for the USAF. Today, Israel’s uniquely configured F-15Ds are among the IAF’s most flexible and capable multi-role fighters. Israel turned their air superiority focused F-15s into long-range strike platforms long before the F-15E Strike Eagle entered service with the USAF (read all about this and the unique evolution of the F-15 in Israeli service in this past feature of mine ). Since then, the “Baz” as it is known locally, has become increasingly “Israelized” with indigenous avionics, munitions, sub-systems, and structural upgrades. F-15D Bazs wearing their conformal “fast pack” fuel tanks, each containing 750 gallons, and twin 610 gallon external drop tanks. , MinoZig/Wikicommons Today the IAF’s D model Baz aircraft are used for a whole series of roles, including counter-air, strike, reconnaissance, and especially as command and control and networking platforms to support long-range strike missions. The C and D models in particular are attractive to the IAF because they are far cheaper—as in free in this case—than their F-15I Strike Eagle derivative cousins but they can also be fitted with “fast pack” conformal fuel tanks for extended range and they can be upgraded locally to handle complex and evolving missions. According to the IAF, the decision to invest heavily in the surplus F-15 “station wagons” was not apparent at first: “The aircraft were decommissioned by the USANG as a part of a natural decommission process and were supposed to be used for spare parts. However, the service members of the IAF’s Materiel Directorate and Technical Branch recognized their potential: two-seat F-15 fighter jets with the ability to carry Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFT). This marked the beginning of the jets’ conversion process to “Baz” models. In the first stage of the project, four aircraft will be converted to the Israeli variant, and will then enter operational service in the IAF. In the second stage, the remaining five aircraft will be converted, replacing five single-seat “Baz” aircraft which will be then be decommissioned.” The end game goal is to increase the amount two-seat Baz jets in Israel’s front-line squadrons while also replacing older worn-out single-seat models. The project is extremely complex and time consuming. It is the first time IAF maintenance specialists have worked on the “D6” block of F-15s—these are literally the first F-15Ds ever built—so there is a lot to learn, and each aircraft will take a whopping 170 days to complete. IAF Because so many components will be changed out and upgrades installed, the teams doing the work will have to record the aircraft’s original configuration and all the unique changes they make so that they can teach IAF ground crews to maintain the jets and operate them once they hit the fleet. Private sector technicians that had worked on the Baz in the past were also brought in for their expertise. Senior Warrant Officer Motti Shpindler from Tel-Nof AFB’s Maintenance Squadron, which is doing the work, states: “Beyond the operational aspect, this project is of professional significance. The technicians participating in this project study the ‘Baz’ as extensively as possible, familiarizing themselves with the aircraft more than any other technician… This is the most complex project we’ve performed.” Senior Warrant Officer Shpindler also added: “A project like this has never been done before, so we utilized the people who are the IAF’s living memory… We disassembled the aircraft and turned it into an Israeli Baz by equipping it with weapon systems that provided it with new capabilities. It will function like the newer Baz jets, utilizing capabilities that even some of the current operational aircraft don’t have.” F-15C Baz in its hardened shelter. , AP Part of the challenge is that these the oldest of F-15Ds have been upgraded time and time again over nearly four decades of service, and those changes were only documented to a certain extent, at least in such a way that the IAF would need to rework them into the indigenous Baz configuration. So a lot of the work is really detective-like in an attempt to understand the jet’s current configuration before reworking into something more capable and suited to the IAF’s demanding needs. As for upgrades, I wrote the following in my previous feature on Israel’s ever more capable Baz fleet: The IAF chose to indigenously upgrade the Baz fleet, mainly due to cost and the fact that its own unique sub-systems would have to be integrated anyway. Known as the Baz 2000 program, this reworking of the best of the IAF’s Baz fleet would give F-15A/B/C/D aircraft a common cockpit configuration, although that was just the start of the improvements… …The Python 4 high-off-boresigh t short-range air-to-air missile and the Elbit DASH helmet mounted sight were introduced into the fleet as well. This gave Baz pilots the ability to engage enemy fighters far off the jet’s centerline by having the pilot simply look at the target and fire the missile. This was a first for the F-15 and a capability that would only come to USAF F-15s well over a decade latter in the form of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System and the AIM-9X Sidewinder. … …Many of the upgrades were ported over from the F-15I, while others were unique to the Baz fleet. The radars were upgraded to fire the AIM-120 AMRAAM. A new Hands-On Throttle And Stick setup was installed. Multi-function displays were added to the cockpit, both front and aft in the B/D model’s case. Enhanced data-links and updated communications gear were installed. A new electronic warfare suite was also integrated into the middle aged jets along with new mission computers and navigation systems (with embedded GPS). Enhanced cooling was also a much needed feature. To support these new systems, the Bazs were totally rewired, which in itself was an impressive feat… …Israel’s reinvigorated Baz fleet has never been more relevant than it is today. The advent of GPS guided weaponry, such as the JDAM , allows them to finally work as pinpoint, all weather, fixed target strikers without having to rely on cumbersome optically guided weaponry. They can also still work as standoff weapons haulers as they had for decades, the only difference being that now Israel has a whole array of standoff weaponry that can be tailored to the target at hand. In addition, the Baz’s speed, range and stability made it an ideal platform for tactical reconnaissance, and large reconnaissance pods have been seen slung underneath these jets over the last decade or so. Because the Baz still has similar range as its more contemporary successors, the F-15I and the F-16I, it can work as a forward deployed networking and command and control node, absorbing the battle picture via data-link from fighters within its line of sight and then beaming this information up to a satellite, which then beams it back down to Israeli commanders hundreds, or even thousands of miles away. This can also go in the opposite direction, with new orders, alerts of pop-up air defenses, and other updates being sent from behind friendly lines or from orbiting strategic intelligence aircraft to the F-15D Baz. From here, the Baz can disperse this information to the rest of the non-satellite communications equipped strike package. This high bandwidth satellite communications modification can be seen on F-15Ds packing a large bulbous R2-D2 like satellite communications dome just behind the jet’s environmental cooling system vent, located on the jet’s forward spine… …Going ‘downtown’ over enemy territory with a strike package is something a traditional command and control aircraft cannot do, but the Baz can. In fact, it can do this while also doing other tasks, such as electronic warfare, attacking fixed targets or conducting counter-air duties. The later of which is what the Baz was originally envisioned for, and with an unbeaten Israeli air combat record to this day of 50 to 0, it is a mission the jet is still very capable of. The Baz is scheduled to not just remain in service for decades to come, but to also receive more investment in the form of additional upgrades. These proposed upgrades could include improving the jet’s radar, upgrading its electronic warfare capability, integrating new weapons, and fielding new cockpit display interfaces. Even a possible structural upgrade may be ordered. This should allow at least the F-15C/D portion of the Baz fleet to continue flying well into the next two decades… …If the F-15C/D Baz fleet were to see an Active Electronically Scanned Array radar upgrade, similar to the USAF’s APG-63V3 radar upgrade for its Eagles, such a powerful radar system could be a force multiplier for the rest of Israel’s fighter fleet. It could provide long-range situational awareness, enhanced ability to spot low-flying cruise missiles and stealthy targets in the homeland defense roll, and it could be yet another electronic attack weapon in Israel’s already bristling bag of electronic warfare tricks. Such a system could also benefit the F-35, which, like all stealth aircraft, best goes about its business without putting any electromagnetic energy into the environment around it. Instead, it could use the F-15C/D’s AESA radar information, taken from dozens of miles to its rear and sent forward to the F-35 via data-link, to evade or even prosecute aerial targets without emitting any electromagnetic energy at all… USAF Even though the IAF is going through a series of major platform changes, including declaring initial operational capability of their growing fleet of F-35Is, as well as putting their oldest F-16As out to pasture once and for all, the original F-15 variant, with some substantial tweaks, remains irreplaceable. Meanwhile the future of the F-15C/D fleet in U.S. service remains unknown. The first of these reworked F-15D aircraft, which is serving as a prototype of sorts, will take to the skies in January. Following a successful flight test program it will enter the fleet operationally as one of the country’s, and world’s for that matter, most advanced F-15s. contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Su-30s Acted As Infrared “Heat Traps” For Putin’s Arrival In Syria Aboard A Tu-214PU,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s triumphant surprise trip to the Middle East earlier this month wasn’t without some peril. Aside from possibly taking out Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, doing the same to his closest ally and the architect of his regime’s survival would be an opposing faction’s highest prize. With this in mind, Russian military planners took special and somewhat unorthodox precautions to protect their President while the aircraft he was in was at its most vulnerable—on approach to landing at Russia’s now permanent master air base south of the Syrian port city of Latakia, also commonly referred to by the Kremlin as Hmeimim Air Base. Hours after his visit to the base on December 11th, 2017, Russia released a highly circulated clip of President Putin riding in the Tu-214PU’s opulent interior, and looking out his window to see Su-30SMs form up on the aircraft’s wing. The fighters tightened up ever closer as the aircraft descended. This wasn’t just a show of force, a militarized welcoming party, or a tactic to offer a general sense of security to the flight as it entered Syrian airspace, it was used to provide “heat traps” to mask the Tu-214PU’s own thermal signature from potential enemies wielding man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), aka shoulder-fired, heat-seeking, anti-aircraft missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=j4hNFva_QzU According to the semi-state news agency RT , one of the Su-30 pilots named “Yury” described their mission as such: “In this case, the task was to meet [the Russian President’s plane] and escort it to the landing strip… One of the tasks was to hereby cover it with ourselves, roughly saying… The temperature of the exhaust gases of the [Su-30SM] plane is much higher… We were flying at maximum capacity because our planes have different speed and it was that we were protecting the presidential plane from both sides with ourselves.” Putin also commented on the operation as well, giving his thanks: “The pilots, those guys, I watched them. They were not just flying nearby during landing, they descended to be flying below our plane… I am thankful to them and want them to hear and know that.” This was a novel way to possibly overcome the Tu-214PU’s lack of infrared countermeasures as it entered into the MANPADS engagement envelope—roughly up to 18,000 feet—over Syria. The aircraft took the route that would provide the least exposure over Syrian territory, flying from Sochi, over Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean, before turning inland over Syria to the south of the air base to set up on final approach. The Tu-214PU is used as a flying command post and VVIP transport for the Kremlin. Think of it as something akin to an E-6B TACAMO and a C-32A—more commonly known as Air Force Two when the Vice President is onboard. It is a twin engine aircraft roughly the size of a 757 and differs significantly from the President’s usual aerial chariot, the much larger, four engine IL-96-300PU . Tu-214PU, Anna Zvereva/wikicommons The Su-30SM doesn’t have a missile approach warning system, but two pairs of eyes watching for the telltale smoke trail of a missile streaking into the air, and the ability to deploy large clouds of flares at an instant, could provide a poor-man’s countermeasure system that goes beyond masking the Tu-214PU’s infrared signature with the Su-30s comparatively hot AL-31FL engine exhausts. Still, at very low altitude there would be little time to react to such an attack manually. Russia had been roughly 15 years behind the U.S. when it comes to infrared countermeasures used to defend large aircraft from MANPADS threats. American aircraft like the C-32, VC-25A, C-17, C-5, C-130, CV-22, CH-53 and others use increasingly capable and even more miniaturized directional infrared countermeasure systems (DIRCM) along with traditional decoy flares and BOL-IR countermeasures to defend themselves. DIRCM systems fire a low-power modulated laser beam into the incoming missile’s infrared seeker to blind it. This system, along with an aircraft expendable decoys, are cued collectively by a automated central system and control panel that receives missile approach warning indications from staring sensors distributed around the aircraft. In recent years Russia has worked hard to begin closing this technological gap and has started to field their President-S DIRCM system , with combat helicopters in Syria appearing with it installed in 2016. Foreign operators of Russian helicopter types have also been receiving the system as well. The technology is being miniaturized and adapted to fit on large and small Russian fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, Russia is also looking to turbo-charge development of similar systems that will utilize similar early warning missile detection sensors to defend their bomber fleet from missile attacks.

Its laser turret can be seen housed under a small glass dome that is mounted behind as well as below the Su-57s cockpit. Missile approach warning systems that will direct this system are scattered around the aircraft. But the extent of the 101KS-O’s capabilities and exactly when it will be fully operational is still unknown. Similar DIRCM capabilities haven’t been ported over to the latest generations of high-flying western fighter aircraft, but high-energy lasers that can shoot down any type of incoming missile, not just blind infrared missile seekers, are now one of the top developmental air combat priorities for the Pentagon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Queen Elizabeth Class Carriers Have Woefully Inadequate Close-In Air Defense Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are an endless number of opinions regarding the relevancy, operational feasibility, and overall opportunity cost of the UK’s two new Queen Elizabeth class supercarriers , and the ship’s capabilities are always part of this debate as well. But one thing seems glaringly clear—these massive vessels are woefully lacking when it comes to their ability to defend themselves from an anti-ship missile barrage. These mighty ships displace 70,000 tons, will deploy with over 1,500 souls onboard, and will carry dozens of aircraft that collectively cost billions of dollars, yet they are only equipped with three Mk15 Phalanx close-in weapon systems (CIWS) , with each covering a slice of airspace surrounding the vessel. The decades old Phalanx remains a capable system in its upgraded form, especially against traditional anti-ship cruise missiles and small unmanned aircraft. It can engage small surface threats as well. But it also suffers from limited magazine depth, highly limited reach, and is not that well suited to defend the ship against higher-end supersonic and stealthy cruise missiles that are now proliferating around the globe. AP This is especially true when it comes to fending off higher-volume missile barrages. In other words, the Phalanx represents an absolute minimum in close-in defensive capability for any surface combatant. For a massive aircraft carrier it alone is totally insufficient. For comparison, a U.S. Navy America class amphibious flattop, which displaces 25,000 tons less water than the Queen Elizabeth class, has a defensive suite that includes two Phalanx systems, two RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile Mk49 launchers (RAM), and two RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) Mk29 launchers. America’s Nimitz class supercarriers, which displaces 30,000 tons more water than the Queen Elizabeth class, feature three Phalanx systems, two RAM launchers, and two ESSM launchers. The main difference between this armament and what is found on the Queen Elizabeth class is that these vessels have their own layered air defense system that can operate independent of a larger carrier group and its integrated air warfare concept. A RIM-116 RAM is fired aboard the USS Kearsarge. The Mk29 ESSM launcher is seen in the foreground., Raytheon This starts with the ship’s ESSM capability that can reach out a couple dozen miles and hit highly agile targets, and it can now do so without independent radar illuminators guiding them to said target. The RAM capability can also hit highly agile and fast-moving targets but at closer ranges—about half a dozen miles out—via homing in on the target’s infrared signature and/or its electronic emissions. Finally, if all else fails, the Phalanx can spew a string of tungsten at the incoming missile at very short ranges in hopes of shattering it before it reaches the carrier’s hull or superstructure. The Queen Elizabeth class has just this last ditch inner most defensive layer. What’s also important to note is that each layer uses different types of detection and engagement concepts to attack a threat, making their combined layered defense even more potent. What electronic countermeasures may confuse an ESSM, wouldn’t work on a RAM, and so on. In addition to these “kinetic” defensive layers, America’s carriers carry multiple “soft-kill systems,” including powerful electronic warfare suites arrayed along the perimeter of each ship, as well as expendable countermeasure systems and decoys such as MK-36 Super Rapid Blooming Offboard Chaff (SRBOC) and Mk53 launchers firing NULKA active decoys . The Queen Elizabeth class will supposedly receive the Terma decoy system , but it’s unclear if the ship will also be outfitted with an extensive electronic warfare suite of any kind. If there aren’t any plans to do so, it would extremely alarming, especially considering these systems are just as critical in stopping attacks as close-in kinetic defensive options, and they are probably the most realistic option for defending against emerging capabilities, such as hypersonic or near hypersonic anti-ship cruise missiles. Raytheon’s AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite has been constantly upgraded over the years and is just as important to the carrier’s survival as kinetic self defense systems. It now features the addition of “Sidekick” active jamming arrays placed around the ship to private an even harder target for enemy missiles. , Yasu osugi/wikicommons Like the Queen Elizabeth class, American flattops all carry fighter aircraft that can fly out and intercept threats at a distance. The problem here is that these aircraft have limited air-to-air missile carry capabilities, and hard to detect, sea-skimming missiles can sneak by, some at very high speed. In addition, keeping patrols airborne at all times is unrealistic and may not even be effective, especially if the potential vector of attack is unknown. In most cases a pair of jets would sit alert 5 or alert 15, but by the time they are in the air, having a substantial impact on an anti-ship missile barrage may not be possible. One of the UK’s F-35Bs joins up with Hawk T1s. , Royal Navy Carriers that use short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL), like the F-35B, are also more sortie limited than their catapult launch and barrier arrestment recovery cousins. STOVL aircraft also usually have significantly less range than their traditional fixed-wing counterparts, and in the case of the Queen Elizabeth class, where no aerial refueling capability is planned at this time, keeping up persistent, or even semi-persistent combat air patrols is unlikely. Also these vessels will usually deploy with a mix of aerial assets aboard, and fighters will usually make up just a portion of the ship’s air wing. This means there are maybe a dozen or two dozen fighter aircraft available for any missions, including air defense, as compared to an American supercarrier that hosts double that number of fighters. And for many of the Queen Elizabeth’s mission configurations she won’t carry any F-35Bs at all, especially for littoral maneuver and amphibious assault operations. AW-101 Merlins aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth. The ship will likely carry more helicopters than F-35Bs over its lifetime, with its air wing consisting only of helicopters for some missions., AP These amphibious types of operations, where helicopters alone will make up the carrier’s air wing, will also likely bring the ship closer to shore and in tighter spaces where her movements will be more restrictive and predictable. This will put the ship at even greater risk of anti-ship missile attacks, which can come at very short notice due to the close proximity to shore. The Queen of England at the HMS Queen Elizabeth’s commissioning ceremony. That is some cake right?!, AP Some will say, “but there will always be a Type 45 destroyer around to protect her.” Hopefully this is true, but the truth is these vessels, although capable, aren’t anywhere near 100 percent reliable even while deployed. Key mission systems break down and need maintenance, sometimes suddenly, leaving huge gaps in the carrier group’s air warfare defensive umbrella. Not to mention the Royal Navy’s trouble deploying ships as it is—especially their Type 45s. And this is without the demands of potentially having to support two carrier groups placed upon the relatively tiny cadre of just six ships. Royal Navy frigates , which are being equipped with the advanced Sea Ceptor missile system, can provide more limited area air defense, but their capabilities aren’t comparable to their more advanced, Aster missile-slinging, Type 45 destroyer counterparts. HMS Daring, one of just six Type 45 destroyers in the Royal Navy fleet. , Royal Navy/MoD/Crown Copyright Most importantly, these destroyers, nor the more advanced and capable Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers that accompany American flattops, can provide an impenetrable air defense bubble even while they are operating at full capacity. When deployed with multiple examples in a flotilla, their overall air defense capability and reliability will increase, but will the Royal Navy really be able to consistently deploy two carriers with a minimum of two Type 45 destroyers each and keep up with so many other tasking commitments? Regardless of how many top-of-the-line air defense picket ships can be allocated to a single carrier group, it’s most important to understand that the enemy is unlikely to fire a single missile, or even a handful at one time. A future anti-ship missile attack in a medium to high-threat combat environment would be multi-layered using various anti-ship systems at once, and even possibly anti-ship ballistic missiles . Peer states have built up their capabilities to do just this, and even rogue states and non-state actors have increasingly deadly capabilities that can target a carrier and its escorts, especially at close range, while transiting through or operating in tight waterways. The Persian Gulf in particular is an especially deadly spot for a carrier group, and Iran has throngs of anti-ship missiles that could be launched at short notice, all within close range of a patrolling carrier group. In essence, missile attacks in littoral environments reduced many of the advantages offered by an air warfare destroyer escort and its longer-range anti-air missiles. AP Even during “blue water” operations far out to sea, a cruise missile barrage from shore, an enemy submarine , or a ship can overwhelm the best defenses. Simply put, “leakers” can get through, and against a robust enemy, multiple leakers of various performance capabilities could slip by and make their way into the carrier group’s inner air defense sanctum. With all this in mind, the Royal Navy’s choice to rely on the Phalanx alone for organic close-in air defense is very concerning. At the very least, Rolling Airframe Missile launchers should be added to the Queen Elizabeth class’s onboard arsenal, as well as an advanced electronic warfare suite if one isn’t already planned. If space is limited, and integration costs are to be minimized, even something like SeaRAM, which can operate independently of the ship’s combat system and sensors like Phalanx does, would be a worthwhile interim solution. The U.S. Navy has even retrofitted some of its forward-deployed destroyers with the system to dramatically augment these ships’ single Phalanx mount as it was seen as inadequate for patrols in higher-threat areas, especially those where anti-ship missiles are prevalent. Some may say that the Royal Navy will equip these ships with directed-energy (laser) CIWS defenses once the technology is mature. That is fine a good, but these ships will be fully operational long before this capability can compete with kinetic systems available today. And even then they may be severely lacking when it comes to engaging multiple targets quickly, especially fast-flying ones and in environmental conditions that are common in maritime environment. So this is simply not a relevant argument at this time. There is no bigger naval target for the enemy to go after than an aircraft carrier, both in terms of size and radar signature, and in terms of symbolism and military value. Spending billions of pounds developing and building these ships, and then spending billions more on aircraft to fly from their decks, but not spending a handful of millions to give them adequate and proven defenses that are considered minimum requirements by their foreign flattop operator counterparts is a misguided and strange choice. AP Maybe there isn’t the will or the dollars to get these ships fully outfitted with similar defensive capabilities as their American counterparts, but at the very least giving them two types of very different close-in weapon systems and an electronic warfare suite to backstop them isn’t too much to ask. Considering what’s at stake and the rough neighborhoods where these ships could find themselves, it really shouldn’t even be choice. In the end one has to remember that the thing about shipborne defenses, especially the close-in variety, is that you only need them when you really actually need them, and a little money spent now can help forestall a big disaster and huge economic loss down the line.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just weeks ago we told the story of Germany’s puzzling Baden-Wurttemberg class Type 125 (F125) frigate program. Not only did we discuss the ship’s odd mission and design features, but we also highlighted some of the troubling post-delivery issues with the lead ship in the class. These problems include a persistent list to starboard and the fact that the ship is dramatically overweight, which would limit its performance, increase its cost of operation, and most importantly, negatively impact the Deutsche Marine’s ability to add future upgrades to the somewhat sparsely outfitted vessel. Now the German Navy has officially declined to commission the vessel and will be returning it to Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamberg. The decision to do so was based on a number of “software and hardware defects” according to German media reports. The noted software deficiencies are of particular importance because these destroyer-sized vessels will supposedly be operated by a crew of just 120-130 sailors—just half that of the much smaller Bremen class frigates they replace—continuously for months at a time. On top of that, the design’s reliability is paramount as the four ships in the class are supposed to deploy far from German shores for up to two years at a time. According to Navaltoday.com, this is the first time the German Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery. Baden-Wurttenberg had already missed its planned commissioning date last summer. German Armed Forces via Lurssen Defense Complicating things further is the fact that the fourth and final F125 frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz , was already christened last Spring. Because of the concurrent construction and testing procurement strategy, these vessels are likely to suffer from at least some of the same issues as the lead ship in the class. Aside from this troubling situation, Germany is going through some major tribulations with its naval arm, including the embarrassing reality that the country currently has no operational submarines .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 26, 2016",China’s AG600 Amphibious Flying Boat Takes To The Skies On Its Maiden Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a year and a half since we reported on China’s ambitious AG600 amphibian project, its intended uses, and its strategic implications, but yesterday the indigenous design finally took to the air for the first time. The roughly 737-sized aircraft flew for a short period of time from Zhuhai airport in Guangdong province. The flight seemed fairly uneventful and video of it was aired by Chinese media and has made its way around social media. According to Reuters , shortly after flight the aircraft was described by Chinese state media outlet Xinhua as “a protector spirit of the sea, islands and reefs.” This description isn’t likely that far from the truth as the AG600 will provide a unique capability when it comes to supporting China’s extra-territorial claims located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Most notably the aircraft will be used to support the country’s highly disputed and ever growing man-made island outposts in the South China Sea. The AG600’s aircrew deplanes after a successful first flight., VCG/VCG via Getty Images In July of 2016 The War Zone reported : “Although China’s official stance is that these big amphibians will be used for dousing blazes and executing maritime rescue operations, they will most certainly also be used for patrolling large swathes of water, namely the contested and resource rich waterways of the South China Sea. Similar to how China’s super-sized “coast guard” ships are used in the region, the AG600 will likely be used for spotting, monitoring, and tracking fishing fleets, energy exploration vessels and other nations’ claims and readouts around the highly disputed body of water . The AG600 may also offer enhanced access to China’s smaller man-made island outposts in the South China Sea, especially those without runways. By using a hub and spoke system, leveraging China’s new runway on Fiery Cross Reef , which is capable of handling any aircraft, the AG600 could deliver personnel, fuel and other supplies to smaller islands that were only accessed by vessels and helicopter in the past. With the aircraft’s long-range It could also fly missions to these locales direct from the mainland while still offering a large useful load. By adding fixed-wing accessibility to more of its man-made islands, China would drastically up their strategic value and utility. Really what China has in the AG600 is a new amphibious platform that can be adapted to a whole variety of roles than a specific plane for a specific task. And like so many indigenous Chinese designs, we will likely see multiple variants of this type in the not so distant future. The AG600 could easily be weaponized at least in the surveillance role. Even adding a fighter-sized radar under the aircraft’s large radome and a data-link could allow the aircraft to provide real-time remote targeting of naval vessels for land-based and sea-based anti-ship missiles. It will also be interesting to see if future iterations include under-wing hardpoints for mounting stores and sensors. If so, the AG600 could be turned into a deadly amphibious sea-control platform or a more elaborate anti-submarine warfare aircraft.” , VCG/VCG via Getty Images The AG600 is the largest amphibian currently being produced and the Chinese government currently has 17 on order, although that number could rise dramatically if missionized variants are also put into production. Developing a new aircraft from scratch is a costly endeavor. With this in mind, China will be looking for opportunities to export the AG600 wherever it can. If the aircraft comes close to meeting its design specifications—including flying for 12 hours at a time over nearly 3,000 miles and at a speed of up to 350mph—it could prove as an attractive and adaptable utility aircraft for some. Seeing that the AG600 can fight fires one day and then carry 50 passengers and cargo to remote locations the next, it offers an attractive capability set even if for a relatively limited number of potential customers. We’ll keep an eye on the program as it enters into its flight testing phase, but considering China is trying to elevate their aerospace industry on a global scale, and that this aircraft isn’t a sensitive military capability, there shouldn’t be any shortage of Chinese press on the AG600 or its future exploits.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 28, 2018",Japan And South Korea Eye F-35B For Their Helicopter Carriers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Multiple reports state that Japan and South Korea , both F-35A customers, are now looking toward the possibility of fielding the short-takeoff and vertical landing F-35B model to potentially fly from their existing helicopter carriers. The news comes as little surprise, especially for Japan, whose hulking Izumo class “helicopter destroyers” have always been peculiarly outsized for their mission set and it’s not as if Tokyo hasn’t had its eye on such a capability for some time. Izumo and Kaga , Japan’s largest fighting ships that could potentially accommodate the F-35B., AP South Korea’s interest in the F-35B also isn’t that shocking. The country’s first amphibious flattop, the Dokdo , is smaller than Japan’s Izumo class and it isn’t clear exactly how capable the vessel would be of sustaining F-35B operations without a major refit. A second and updated variant of the Dokdo design is now under construction. That vessel could possibly be modified so that it could handle a small cadre of F-35Bs in the future. ROKS Dokto (LPD-6111) seen operating alongside its US counterparts. , USN Beyond the general dimensional requirements needed to house and operate the F-35B, other vessel-impact issues have to be taken into account as well. The aircraft’s powerful and hot exhaust can severely damage a ship’s deck unless it is specifically reinforced and coated with special materials. That same blast of hot and powerful gas can do damage anywhere on the ship it may pass over. So everything from catwalks, emergency life rafts, communications aerials, sensors, navigational aids, and other fixtures would need to be reinforced or relocated entirely. Lockheed Martin The addition of a ski-jump is not necessary although it would improve the F-35B’s takeoff performance and add an extra margin of safety. The Izumo class, which presently includes two ships, was already designed with the F-35 and V-22 in mind to some degree, and its rear elevator and expansive hangar space can already facilitate movement of either type. Japan has already ordered the Osprey and that aircraft could be a huge force multiplier for shipboard F-35B operations. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dDUQ7Nl1x2I For either country, and for their own reasons, the F-35B could also offer the ability to execute highly dispersed operations independent of massive runways that will be at the top of an enemy’s target list during a conflict (aka ballistic and cruise missile sponges). The F-35B can operate from small strips and reinforced concrete roadways during a time of war. In South Korea the demand for such a capability is extremely obvious as the country’s airports will be the top targets for North Korean missiles and special operations forces during a conflict. Japan, an island nation, could use the F-35B to disperse top-of-the-line air combat capability to remote and austere locations. This could be especially useful in the defense of the country’s southern most islands. Just part of Izumo’s massive hangar deck, AP There may also be an opportunity for either country in the form of America’s soon to be surplus AV-8B Harriers . The Harrier is more compact and lighter than the F-35B that is replacing it, and its exhaust does not present the same compatibility challenges either. Obtaining a small fleet of these aircraft and introducing shipboard STOVL operations would be a far less expensive proposition as well. Turkey is presently going down this exact path . The Dokdo’s configuration., South Korean Governnment Going the AV-8B route could be especially attractive option for South Korea, whose smaller helicopter harriers are better suited for the design and are more focused on amphibious operations in North Korea. A SH-60 landing aboard ROKS Dokto (LPD-6111)., USN If Japan chooses to go down the STOVL route for its Izumo class carriers, it would mark the first time since 1945 that the country has had an operational aircraft carrier capable of fielding fixed-wing aircraft. It would also be among the most glaring diversions from Article Nine of the country’s constitution that drastically limits its offensive warfare capabilities. Japan has gone out of its way to refer to the big Izumo class carriers, and their Hyuga class predecessors , as “helicopter destroyers” because of this issue. But there is no doubt that Japan’s military stature has began to morph in recent years, and especially over the last year , as the threat posed by North Korea has grown significantly . Tokyo’s emerging hunt for long-range cruise missiles is just another indication of this monumental strategic shift. This hotly debated change has largely occurred piecemeal, but supposedly Japan will officially address the legality of these changes and its overall strategic aim in its upcoming National Defense Program Guidelines, which is supposed to be published sometime next year. F-35B with a full external load-out operating from the boat. , Lockheed Martin It would be a good move for either country to procure the F-35B, or used Harriers, for shipboard or dispersed operations. As I have discussed in great detailed over the years , the F-35 A and C models’ design was impacted negatively on virtually all levels to accommodate the B model’s STOVL requirement. With that in mind, by purchasing even small numbers of B models, operators of the A variant can achieve the benefits of the B model’s unique capabilities to offset the performance sacrifices paid by their A model fleet. This may seem like somewhat of an abstract concept but it is a key argument for the jet when it comes to its Pentagon service. The B model, which will only make up roughly 15 percent of the entire F-35 production run, but has penalized the rest of the fleet due to the design compromises it inflicted, is giving America’s total force basically double the number of 5th generation fighter carrying “first day of war” aircraft carriers than it had prior. The B model also offers the potential for highly dispersed operations in areas where traditional stealth fighter aircraft would likely be unable to operate. This capability will develop over time but it would be highly prized during a peer-state conflict in vast and very dangerous Pacific theater. Izumo docking., AP Both South Korea and Japan could also leverage some of these same synergies and benefits by retooling the ships they already have even for low density F-35B operations, or by taking advantage of cheap Harriers with lots of life left in them that will be put on the auction block due to the F-35B entering widespread service with the USMC. Either way, these countries will benefit from the existence of the F-35B. If Japan and/or South Korea move ahead with fielding the F-35B, Australia would likely follow suit as they have a pair of ships that are even better prepared to operate the stealthy strike-fighters—the Canberra class landing helicopter docks. These vessels are license-built iterations of Spain’s proven Juan Carlos class design and were constructed with ski-jumps for operating STOVL jets even though the Royal Australian Navy said they had no intention of procuring them at the time. HMAS Canberra. , USN Now that Australia is set to receive a large fleet of F-35As (72 aircraft planned and that number could grow), introducing the F-35B to their already owned and operated carriers seems almost inevitable. Once again, the Harrier could also be an option here as well, but seeing as the country is a major F-35 customer already, and is set to remodel their entire air combat capability, going for the latest and greatest option seems more likely. All this is happening as China and India work to rapidly build-up their own fixed-wing aircraft carrier capacity. With this in mind, the coming decade could see the strategic naval balance in the Pacific region being heavily dictated by whose carrier strike groups can do what and where.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Lockheed Touts Non-Existent “Beast Mode” F-35 Configuration With 16 Air-To-Air Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has an interesting graphic displayed on their website showing the comparative max load-outs for stealth combat configuration and for non-stealth combat configuration—the latter of which the company refers to as “beast mode.” In the “beast mode” configuration, the graphic depicts an air-to-air optimized load-out that includes a whopping 14 AIM-120 AMRAAMs and a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles —16 missiles in all. But does such a plentiful missile carrying configuration actually exist? No, it doesn’t. Not only has this configuration not been tested but as far as we can tell it isn’t even slated for development anytime in the foreseeable future. The hardware to make it happen doesn’t exist either. It is likely that it’s one theoretical configuration that has been studied in the past that could possibly be included in future block developments at some time if the will, and especially the money, is present for doing so. Lockheed Martin Usually these maximum load-out configurations don’t matter much as they rarely if ever see operational use, but the F-35’s ability to carry a lot of beyond visual range air-to-air missiles does matter. Beyond being able to carry large quantities of missiles for traditional combat air patrols, the idea that a tactical aircraft could operate as something of an arsenal ship for other tactical aircraft is becoming a very attractive capability set. Such a concept could potentially increase the magazine depth and effectiveness of stealthy fighter aircraft operating forward in the counter-air role. Boeing has touted their 2040C F-15 configuration that would be capable of this role and it could prove especially useful as long-range air-to-air missiles become a hot commodity once again. You can read more about this concept here and here . 2040C configuration for the F-15 Eagle capable of carrying 16 AIM-120s (possibly up to 20)., Boeing Having a stealthy flight of F-35s call up missiles on demand from non-stealthy “beast mode” configured F-35s operating many miles behind them could be a huge force multiplier and would help overcome the F-35’s wanting internal air-to-air missile carriage capability, which is limited to four missiles at this time. This is tentatively planned to be increased to six missiles at some point in time, but exactly when this would happen, and what it will cost remains unclear. Lockheed’s notional 14 AMRAAM load-out likely includes this modification. F-35 JPO In the end the graphic is disingenuous, but at the same time it also is somewhat exciting and hints at the possibility of some pretty awesome cooperative F-35 tactics in the future—that is if these notional capabilities get funded. What’s so puzzling is why exactly the F-35 team chose to embellish the aircraft’s current capabilities just in the “beast mode” air-to-air portion of the graphic. They could have as easily showed other various future possible weapons configurations, including internal carriage of smaller hit-to-kill air-to-air missiles in stealth mode, or far more exotic and diverse air-to-ground load-outs than those available today or in the foreseeable future. F-35A’s current weapons menu. , USAF One potential answer to this question is that maybe they are trying and make it seem like the type can compete with non-stealthy advanced 4th generation fighters in the counter-air missile carrying capability realm—once again, an area that is becoming particularly attractive, especially to the Pentagon’s air arms. And once again, this is also a capabilities set that Boeing, Lockheed’s biggest fighter aircraft competitor, increasingly touts for its aircraft. Maneuvering test firing of an AIM-9X., Lockheed Martin Little things like this are why trust in the F-35 program is so low. The Joint Project Office and the aircraft’s prime manufacturer have a long history of making over simplified, misleading, absurdly positive, and not fully accurate statements and claims about the aircraft’s capabilities, timeline, and cost. This only caused more trouble for the already troubled program. Instead, being open about the program, its issues, mistakes that were made, and what to expect in the future would have served the aircraft and its goals far better. If anything else this should be a lesson learned for future weapons development programs. F-35A/C weapons stations capacities., F-35 JPO In this case, its puzzling why Lockheed wouldn’t just say this is something that may be possible in the future instead of acting like it is a current capability. What it will take to realize this exciting capability is far more interesting and important than just putting it out there as a puzzling non-fact for people to decipher for themselves. That being said, now that the USAF, USN, and USMC will end up with many hundreds of these fighters let’s make the very best out of them, and making a notional F-35 air-to-air “arsenal ship” configuration a reality should be bumped up towards the top of the F-35’s to do list.

Trials will start on a land range before moving to the sea aboard one of Russia’s Project 1241 Molniya missile corvettes in the Black Sea. The country’s new Project 22800 Karakurt corvettes will be the first vessels to receive the system operationally once testing is complete. Panstir-ME appears to be something of a mix between the potent Pantsir-S1 land-mobile self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery gun system and existing Kashtan CIWS installations found on many Russian-built naval vessels dating back to the Cold War. It uses a modified version of the Pantsir’s 1RS2-1E phased array radar system as well as an electro-optical/infrared targeting and identification system mounted above the radar in a similar fashion as seen on many of its ground-based cousins. Truck-mounted Pantsir-S1, Russian MoD There is no early warning radar system directly attached to the Panstir-M mount, like the RS1-E1 mounted on many Pantsir-S1 vehicles. Instead, early warning will be provided by the ship’s radar suite and/or by a similar detached early warning radar mounted elsewhere on the ship. The system’s own radar can also provide early warning detection as well as fire control functions over a more limited sector of fire. https://youtube.com/watch?v=t4F2_Zq_YsU Its main armament includes a naval version of the Pantsir’s 57E6-E surface-to-air missile. This is a two-stage missile that can hit targets (aircraft, cruise missiles, drones) from half a mile to ten miles away, and from just a number of feet above the surface up to nearly 30,000 feet. These missiles are carried in four tubes on each side of the turret, and like Kashtan, twin rotating magazines below deck can reload each side four times over automatically within a matter of seconds. 32 missiles in total are carried. Pantsir-ME will also be able to fire the Hermes-K surface-to-surface missile. Presumably, these missiles would be outfitted on the Pantsir-ME when the vessel is operating in littoral areas where small boat swarming attacks are possible, or when nearby shore strikes are required. The Hermes-K can be outfitted with a semi-active laser seeker so that near over-the-horizon targets can be hit precisely if a forward operating unit—such a drone, aircraft, or special operations team—is lasing the target with a laser designator. Because of the system’s unique twin-magazine configuration, a mix of both missiles could be carried operationally. Pantsir-ME brochure. , Rostec Pantsir-ME’s other primary armament includes a pair of very hard hitting GSh-30K six-barrel 30mm rotary cannons that can spew up to 6,000 rounds a minute each. This high volume of fire can be used to shatter incoming anti-ship missiles, aircraft, drones, or small boats. These are the same cannons found on Kashtan, and they deviate from the land-based Pantsir-S1 design, which uses the lower rate of fire, twin barreled, 2A38M 30mm cannons. The system can operate autonomously or it can be tied to a network of similar mounts scattered around a larger vessel. It can also be integrated into the ships larger overall combat system. This flexibility allows the system to be fielded on everything from corvettes, to frigates, to destroyers, to Kirov class battlecruisers . Russia’s sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , is currently undergoing a refit that will supposedly include installing Pantsir-ME in place of its eight existing Kashtan-M CIWS systems. According to Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov each Pantsir-ME mount can engage four targets simultaneously, and will have a probability of kill three to four times greater than existing Kashtan-M installations. Like Kashtan before it, the Pantsir-ME is unique in that it integrates both a highly-agile missile and a rapid-firing CIWS gun system into a single package, and features weapons redundancy on every mount. With a much needed refresh to its control interface, its sensors, and its missiles, Russia has executed on a fairly brilliant plan that will build on the Kashtan in a logical way while also using existing components to decrease costs and lower development and integration risk. Altogether, this new system will allow Russia to maintain credible kinetic CIWS defenses into the coming decades as the Pantsir-ME will also likely benefit to some degree from upgrades made on its land-based counterpart. Rostec Considering the new emphasis being put on anti-ship missile capabilities by Russia’s potential foes—namely the U.S. and its allies—investing in updated CIWS definitely makes sense, especially as Russia works to rebuild their hulking Cold War-era navy into a more agile and technologically advanced force. And of course the fact that the first operational units will be installed on Project 22800 corvettes, one of Russia’s ambitious naval projects that could lead to sales abroad, is also a sign that having a modern CIWS system is essential when it comes to realizing naval fighting ship export success. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YrWFu0SL25o Although Russia is somewhat of a world leader in short-range air defense (SHORAD) capabilities, the country is unlikely to be able to compete, at least initially, with Western high-power directed energy (laser) CIWS concepts that will be emerging in the coming decades. As a result, fielding the most capable and updated kinetic CIWS systems is likely to be an increasing focus for Russia’s Navy going forward, and Pantsir-ME definitely delivers on that idea. The system is slated for operational use in the 2019-2020 timeframe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021","In An Age Of Brexit Austerity, British Lawmakers Now Want A New Royal Yacht","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A cadre of 50 conservative British lawmakers are pushing a plan to field a new royal yacht through a lottery scheme that would raise roughly 120 million pounds to fund the project. The vessel would be a “floating palace” that would work as a sort of global brand and economic ambassador for Britain and would provide “unique soft power and influence around the globe” according to MP Craig Mackinlay who is heading up the initiative. The ship would host elite gatherings that highlight British industrial, business, and humanitarian projects and it would be deployed for trade negotiations. The vessel would also be capable of hosting members of the royal family for pleasure purposes just like its predecessors. A similar idea was splashed all over the British tabloids back in 2012 , featuring laughably wondrous drawings of a “new Britannica” that would provide similar functions as its predecessor and more. That initiative never came to fruition, which isn’t surprising as austerity measures following the global economic collapse were all the rage at the time. Proponents of idea in its current form say the vessel will be needed in a post-Brexit reality, where Britain will be “going it alone” when it comes to global trade. MP Craig Mackinlay elaborated on the idea, stating : “As we leave the European Union, there has never been a better time to consider how Britain projects herself on the world stage… The new Royal Yacht must belong to the state so it has the benefit of diplomatic immunity when it visits international harbors around the globe… It has to fly the white ensign, because it is crucial that it is crewed by our Royal Navy. And it has to have a strong connection with our royal family, as that is the unique quality that will make its service to our nation succeed… Britain remains the third largest maritime power in the world and we have a unique history and connection with the sea… Our country needs and deserves a floating Royal Palace that can be used to host meetings and exhibitions to showcase the best of British business and project our humanitarian role across the globe.” HMY Britannia , the last royal yacht, was retired in 1997 due to the high cost of operation and scheduled refits. The vessel is now on display in Edinburgh, Scotland. , AP Even though procuring this vessel won’t cut directly into the Ministry of Defense’s ever tightening budget, it actually is very likely to do just that in an indirect manner. The truth is that such a vessel will also be a monumental target for all types of enemies of the British Crown. It will need constant protection from multiple mediums of attack, especially when it sails abroad, and seeing that such a vessel will be outfitted nowhere near to that of fighting ship’s standards, it will be especially vulnerable to the threats it will face. In other words, this ship will still require big dollars and resources from the Royal Navy in order to carry out its supposed mission. And those are dollars the seagoing service definitely doesn’t have. Resources are even more limited when it comes to the availability of the Royal Navy’s surface combatants—and the manpower needed to operate them—that would be needed to provide escort for such a ship. This problem is only going to be exacerbated further when the Royal Navy’s two supercarriers enter operational service in the coming years. There is also the issue of maintaining and operating the vessel itself. When it comes to things that float, what is a gorgeous traveling example of national pride one year can be a rotting national embarrassment the next if funds aren’t available to keep the vessel in top shape. Even for private yachts, it costs roughly ten percent of the ship’s procurement cost every year to keep it operating, and that rule of thumb is for private luxury vessels used by a small group of people, not a national brand ambassador that hosts high-profile events and makes planned ports of call throughout the year. Also the budget to build such a vessel may be lacking as super yachts can cost upwards of half a billion dollars once fully outfitted. A different era for Britain: Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh waving as Concorde flies by the Royal Yacht Britannia as the royal couple neared Barbados in 1977., AP Although the monarchy’s connection with the sea is historically strong, the last royal yacht, the HMY Britannia, was decommissioned two decades ago. That vessel was part of a long line of 83 royal yachts dating back to when King Charles II took to the throne in 1660. Beyond entertaining the royal family, during its time on the high seas Britannia was also used to assist in establishing trade deals, but what difference it really made in this regard is largely subjective. MP Deidre Brock said the following about the proposed plan: “It sometimes seems all part of a Tory grand plan to drag the UK back to the 50s – the 1850s that is… Of course the Royal Yacht Britannia is a fantastic tourist attraction in Leith in my constituency, but the Tory obsession that a new yacht will somehow magically deliver them trade deals is simply bizarre.” Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, with the Royal Yacht Britannia seen in the background, during the Royal Tour of Canada in 1959. , AP Regardless of the historic precedent for such a vessel or how it would be funded, the optics surrounding it seem terrible at a time when the Royal Navy is challenged to keep up with its basic tasking and when the country is already receiving two controversial supercarriers at the cost of billions of pounds. And it isn’t even clear if those vessels will both have the funds to operate at the same time, or if they will have their full aircraft complements to deploy with, not to mention the available escorts needed to deploy operationally to troubled regions around the globe. This isn’t even factoring the economic uncertainty and cuts to social programs that are impacting the daily lives or spending habits of average British citizens. Rendering of the Royal Navy’s proposed updated royal yacht dating back to before the retirement of HMY Britannia . Later designs, like the one seen in the tweet near the top of this post, were far more extravagant. , MoD Even the lottery scheme that would supposedly fund the acquisition of the vessel without the use of tax dollars isn’t as easy as it sounds according to conservative cabinet minister David Mellor: “It’s far more complicated than they seem to think to create a separate lottery for the royal yacht. It would require almost certainly primary legislation and I’m sure no-one is going to thank them for that in the world of Brexit.” HMY Britannia’s silhouette sure was easy on the eyes., AP Although the nostalgia behind the idea of a British royal yacht is potent and enticing, there has to be better causes to use the national lottery on than a luxury like this. And regardless of how it is funded, it will still look bad for those who push for it, especially when there are so many other issues in need of focus by British lawmakers right now. Considering the country doesn’t even have a dedicated aircraft for moving around its Prime Minister and their cabinet, building a yacht for national prestige and economic influence just seems like a very antiquated and wasteful idea. And let’s be honest, fielding a fully outfitted supercarrier is a big enough elevation in real naval prestige for Britain, yet alone two of them. Still, it’s a good reason for us to look back to the past, when vessels like Britannia were national icons.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As we are about to turn the page to a new year, we look back on 2017 to see what we leave behind, and I think many Americans would say good riddance to a year that saw an ever more divided America, sequential natural disasters, and major threats growing abroad. But amongst the black hole of negative news we trudge through on a daily basis, there are amazingly brilliant flashes of bright light—little stories that remind us how incredibly giving mankind can be and what incredible bravery hides deep inside average everyday people. In an age where people flock to theaters multiple times a year to watch never ending fist fights without consequences among super heroes wearing bright costumes and capes, it’s odd that more attention and fanfare isn’t given to real life superheroes who do amazingly courageous acts without the help of supernatural abilities or a trust fund worth billion dollars that can be blown on high-end military gear. If people were to just look harder, they would realize that reality is more incredible than fiction, and it doesn’t require “the force” to change the course of human lives in incredibly positive ways. On Thursday night one of these incredible acts of heroism took place among the setting of the worst building fire New York has experienced in 25 years. The century-old Bronx apartment building was set ablaze by a three year old who was playing with the stove in an apartment on the first floor. The staircase in the five story, 29 unit complex acted like chimney and the fire spread rapidly through the building along with acrid and thick black smoke. By the time it was all over 12 people, including four children, were declared dead as a result of the ensuing inferno and seven firefighters and seven civilians were also injured, some severely. The fire spread rapidly. It was documented that some of the smoke alarms weren’t operative on the first floor of the building weeks before the fire ignited. , Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images But now it is coming to light that those casualty figures would have been far worse if it weren’t for 28 year old Emmanuel Mensah. The newly minted U.S. Army soldier that had just completed basic training was home for Christmas and would likely be on his way to an assignment overseas in the near future. Emmanuel was staying in a friend’s apartment located in the building at the time the fire was sparked and witnesses saw him rush back into the burning structure, bringing out trapped inhabitants each cycle. He made at least two of these trips before disappearing inside and not returning as the fire’s intensity overtook much of the structure. After the blaze finally dissipated and firefighters could make it further inside, the body of Emmanuel Mensah was found in apartment 15. His friends apartment was number 11. Emmanuel died of smoke inhalation. Mensah’s father, who lives next door to the doomed apartment building, stated the following to the New York Post: “I understand when the fire was [going} he was trying to rescue… He had two or three people out… He just came for the holidays… He helped his roommate’s wife and children, they were trying to come out to the stairs and he stopped them… He told them to come out the window… Then he went in and tried to rescue people out.” Emmanuel loved America deeply, although it was not his native country. He moved to the United States from Ghana half a decade ago. Soon after arriving in the U.S. he told his father he wanted to be a soldier in the Army, and even though his family tried to change his mind, his dream of serving his country never wavered. One can only imagine how incredible of a soldier Emmanuel, who had a knack for sharpshooting, would have become if he had not sacrificed his life for others. On a battlefield such a selfless act could have resulted in him being awarded an illustrious medal, and even a Medal of Honor. In the end this story is a reminder that the real superheroes aren’t found in Marvel movies, they walk among us, and thankfully, many of those heroes have chosen to put on a uniform for a career. Above all else, with all the selfishness, greed, violence, lies, and hate we see on a daily basis, it is so amazing to know that there are still people out there that can rise far above all of it when it really matters. Private Emmanuel Mensah is a better man than I would ever hope to be, and he gives us all hope as we step into 2018.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Kim Jong Un Rings In New Year By Telling World He Has Nuclear “Button” Installed On Desk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In his sixth annual New Years address, Kim Jong Un stated that the United States can’t wage war against his country in any form because he had “the entire mainland of the U.S.” within reach of his intercontinental ballistic missiles and that he has a “nuclear button” always on the desk in his office. The young tyrant emphasized that “this is not a threat but a reality.” Hopefully he is speaking metaphorically about the “nuclear button” on his desk as executive command and control architecture for nuclear weapons release is often referred to as “the button” but in reality it is usually more complex than that. Then again, Kim Jong Un has been frighteningly accurate with his statements regarding North Korea’s nuclear program. Just last year, during his fifth New Years address, Kim stated that he was entering the “final stages” of preparations for a test launch of a ICBM. At the time many discounted this claim as bluster, but they would later find out that it was all too true. The mental image of North Korea’s already comic book-like super villain leader having a big red button on his desk that would bring about a massive war, and even a nuclear exchange, on a whim is bordering on Dr. Evil territory. But who knows, the ultra paranoid leadership in Pyongyang knows full well that their command and control systems would come under near instant electronic and cyber attack—and eventually kinetic attack—the second hostilities are detected, so simplifying and turbocharging the command release procedure for the country’s nuclear stockpile could very well be a primary goal of the regime. At the very least it would lend credibility to the country’s nuclear deterrent, albeit in a terribly frightening way. At the same time it could mean recalling the country’s nuclear forces once an order is given could be near impossible. AP Kim’s New Years message also deviated from the usual bellicose rhetoric into a bit less combative messaging, stating that his nuclear nation “loves peace” and that as long as there isn’t any aggression against him and his people he “doesn’t intend to use nuclear powers.” At the same time, the address gave no signs that Kim’s regime has any intentions of giving up its nuclear arsenal or missile programs. The speech comes on the same day that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen gave a dire warning about the collision course the U.S. and North Korea are presently on. With Pyongyang unwilling to denuclearize and no real pathway being offered by the Trump Administration to enter into direct negotiations, the chances that there could be a peaceful deescalation through diplomacy seem increasingly slim. Former Joint Chiefs chair Mike Mullen tells @ThisWeekABC the U.S. is closer than ever to nuclear war with North Korea. ""I don't see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this particular point."" https://t.co/nGm78y1V4W pic.twitter.com/XtqKmf54An — ABC News (@ABC) January 1, 2018 It also comes as allegations stack up against China and Russia that they are cheating on U.N. sanctions against North Korea by executing ship-to-ship transfers of contraband fuel reserves to the rogue nation. These developments are troubling to say the least and undermine the power the U.N. has when it comes to having its own members enforce its resolutions. Ships are now being seized and the whole affair seems to be inching toward a naval blockade of the country, a tactic we pointed out last September as a possible option to put extreme pressure on the North Korean regime. With North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs leaping far ahead of almost all estimates last year, and as a threat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific looming, not to mention tensions between the Kim regime and the Trump administration at an all time high, there is even more uncertainty surrounding the high-stakes standoff going in to 2018 than there was going into 2017.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 9, 2018",New Details Emerge In Boeing’s First Video Of Its Carrier-Based Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After getting our first look before Christmas , Boeing has now released the first video, albeit brief, of their entrant into the MQ-25 Stingray Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) competition . The video offers fleeting new glimpses from different angles of the drone, and from these clips we can come to some new conclusions, but the video also prompts new questions as well. Like the two earlier images of Boeing’s Phantom Works’ new CBARS design, this release was also pushed through the Boeing Defense Twitter account. It also lines up perfectly with what Boeing told The War Zone directly after the December 19th unveil, that more imagery would be released in early January. The short video gives us a few new angles of the company’s MQ-25 prototype. First we get an oddly framed, eye-level panning shot of the aircraft’s fuselage. The aircraft’s wing roots and large splayed V-tail can also be seen. What’s missing is an air intake large enough to feed a jet engine capable of propelling a tanker-drone carrying many thousands of pounds of fuel. Twitter Screencap Then we get maybe the most exciting shot out of the video, a wide, side-view clip of the MQ-25 being rolled out of a hangar. The aircraft looks way more streamlined and elongated than expected. The nose is briefly seen and its leading area is a planar, trapezoid-shaped flat design. The aircraft’s chine-line that runs along the edge of its fuselage is very prominent in this clip as well, along with its very heavy duty landing gear. But once again, no large, protruding jet intake can be seen. Twitter Screencap The next quick set of clips show the aircraft’s nose section, including its array of pitot tubes and a detailed view of its chine-line. We see some interesting angles as that edge transitions from the wing root to the nose. Twitter Screencap The next shot, a closeup of the Boeing logo and the stenciled motif on the side of the drone’s fuselage is maybe the most telling as we can clearly read the stenciled caution box on the top of the fuselage: “JET INTAKE DANGER” with an arrow pointing up. Twitter Screencap Then we get an awesome underside view of Boeing’s MQ-25 and its hardy landing gear. The fuselage, even for a prototype/demonstrator, is rounded and smooth and its joints appear nearly nonexistent. Most notably we see that the aircraft’s tailhook is shrouded, and drops down out of the fuselage. Also worth noting is the large rounded lump midway down the wing. This is the best glimpse of the aircraft’s wing as of yet. Twitter Screencap We finally get a running shot down the MQ-25’s long fuselage, with various access panels visible before the video returns us to the first images released of the MQ-25 on December 19th, 2017. Twitter screencap Boeing Photo So what are the takeaways here? 1.) The MQ-25 design appears to feature an entirely flush dorsal jet intake. You can even see the intake cover in the rollout sequence. Designing an intake completely flush with the top of an aircraft, especially one that appears to have lifting body traits, is usually avoided do to airflow disruption issues that can have catastrophic results, especially during maneuvering and terminal phases of flight. Any issues with airflow during takeoff and landing would be magnified during carrier operations, where the aircraft is hurtled off the deck at high acceleration via a catapult and when the aircraft lands, making rapid engine corrections at slow speed and high angles of attack. Digital engine controls have come a long way when it comes avoiding engine anomalies due to airflow issues, but a flush-mounted inlet on this design for this mission in particular could signal some sort of a breakthrough. The only other possibility is that a protruding engine inlet has not been fitted yet, although that seems somewhat unlikely based on the imagery we have seen so far. Boeing’s original art for the more complex, multi-role UCLASS program that was replaced with the tanker-focused CBARS program, showed a very similar design, albeit with a huge dorsal intake. , Boeing 2.) There appears to be more low observable design elements built into Boeing’s MQ-25 than what the CBARS requirements dictate, which are none. Basic low-observable features, including the inlet, likely the exhaust, tail configuration, and especially elements of the fuselage design, not to mention the enclosed tailhook and apparent focus on creating smooth, continuously rounded surfaces, point to the possibility that MQ-25 has a reduced radar signature, and that its signature could possibly be reduced much further if it were adapted to take on new missions in the future. This approach isn’t all that surprising for the Phantom Works. Even the Super Hornet design features low-observable elements, from its semi-S shaped intakes and radar defeating engine fan baffles, to sawtoothed edges on some of its access points and doors, not to mention the use of low-reflectivity composites in key areas of the airframe. But when it comes to the MQ-25, being able to get a foothold in the emerging unmanned carrier-borne aircraft space, and “spiraling” the development of new and enhanced capabilities without having to design an entirely new airframe is simply a good business decision. The unmanned is the future, even to a degree that people don’t realize , and especially when it comes to naval aviation. But beyond the engine inlet mystery, there are other things to ponder. The bulge on the wing is interesting. It likely includes a wing folding mechanism, although satellite communications arrays would be another, albeit less likely possibility. We also don’t see that large ventral door/panel open in any of these clips like we did in the reveal photo. Maybe what’s most intriguing is what this video doesn’t show. The MQ-25’s wings, portions of its tail structure, exhaust, and the aircraft’s upper fuselage design are still a mystery. Why these features have yet to be shown is also unknown. Are they sensitive in nature or is Boeing just looking to trickle out images of the aircraft over time to build public interest in it? We just don’t know. But what we do know is that the Phantom Works’ take on the MQ-25 Stingray seems to be a bit more exotic than what was initially let on. The Navy’s CBARS contract, which General Atomics and Lockheed are also competing for, is slated to be awarded near the end of this Summer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According Russian news outlet Kommersant and repeated by Reuters , at least seven aircraft were destroyed during an mortar attack by “radical islamists” on the country’s “Khmeimim” air base outpost located south of the port city of Latakia in Syria. If the report proves accurate, it would signify the largest single loss of military equipment since Russia dove into the Syrian conflict kinetically in late 2015. In addition to the aviation-related losses, the report says at least ten people were injured on the base during the onslaught. It also details the aircraft involved, including at least four Su-24 Fencer attack jets, two Su-35 multi-role fighters, and an AN-72 tactical transport. A Russian AN-72 on the ground at the country’s air base in Syria., AP The potential loss of so many aircraft due to a mortar attack is not implausible. Since Russia arrived at the base, tactical aircraft were grouped very close together, along with nearby munitions. Even as the base expanded sizably, and aprons were extended (the aircraft originally parked on the parallel runway), aircraft have remained in close proximity to each other with no revetments of any kind installed. As such, a single mortar could cause a chain reaction, destroying multiple aircraft lined up in a small area. An ammo depot was also struck according to the two unnamed diplomatic sources the article refers to. The incident could be somewhat embarrassing for President Putin, who recently visited the base to triumphantly declare victory against extremists and anti-Assad elements within the country. Putin’s primary message was accompanied by the order to at least partially pull out of Syria militarily, although similar statements have been made in the past only to see more Russian military resources pour into the troubled country. Just days ago there was another loss of a Russian aircraft in Syria as well. An Mi-24 Hind went down killing the two crewmen aboard. Russia says the crash was not caused by enemy fire. Su-24s sitting close together on the apron at Russia’s air base in Syria., AP Russia now has decades’ worth of rights to both the air base near Latakia, Syria and its only Mediterranean port in Tartus, Syria—which is also undergoing a massive expansion. Russia not officially commented on the report as of yet. UPDATE: Russia has confirmed that the mortar attack on the base did occur, and sadly servicemen were killed during the event. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated : “On December 31, 2017, after dark, the Hmeymim airfield suddenly came under mortar shelling from a mobile subversive group of militants. As a result of the attack, two servicemen were killed… Syrian security forces are carrying out measures to find and eliminate the militants involved in the attack as well as to enhance safety at the nearby territory.” They went on to deny that any materiel was damaged in the barrage, which isn’t surprising.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 4, 2018","Enhanced Patriot Missile Enters Full Rate Production, Will Sell Like Hotcakes","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest iteration of the popular Patriot Missile System, known as the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE), helped swat down multiple targets over White Sands Missile Range during a complex test last November. The PAC-3 MSE interceptor was joined during the test by the Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) Patriot variant that aims at reducing the cost per shot of the long-running missile type. This successful test evolution marked the end of the validation phase for the PAC-3 MSE, with the missile having been cleared for full rate production. A contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars was subsequently awarded by the Pentagon in January 2nd, 2018 to build large quantities of the missiles for the US Army and an increasing number of American allies that field the system. According to Lockheed’s literature the Missile Segment Enhancement Patriot Missile variant is described as such: “The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) is an evolution of the battle-proven PAC-3 Missile. The hit-to-kill PAC-3 MSE provides performance enhancements that counter evolving threat advancements. The enhancements ensure the PAC-3 Missile Segment of the PATRIOT Air Defense System is capable of engaging new and evolving threats. The hit-to-kill PAC-3 Missile is the world’s most advanced, and capable theater air defense missile and defender against the entire threat to the PATRIOT Air Defense System: Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBMs) carrying weapons of mass destruction, evolving cruise missiles and aircraft. The PAC-3 MSE design utilizes the latest technology to significantly increase performance. The PAC-3 MSE incorporates a larger, dual pulse solid rocket motor; larger fins; and upgraded actuators and thermal batteries to accommodate increased performance. The modifications extends the missile’s reach.The PAC-3 MSE is packaged in a single canister that stacks to provide logistical flexibility. Twelve individual PAC-3 MSE Missiles can be loaded on a PATRIOT Launcher or a combination of six MSEs and eight PAC-3 Missiles (two four packs) can be loaded.” In addition, Lockheed sums up the advantages of the system by stating these key features: Improves effectiveness throughout current battlespace Expands missile performance battlespace in altitude and range Defender against PATRIOT full regime of system threats Minimal launcher modifications required Dual pulse technology enables further improvements to overall system performance and lethality Lockheed The MSE’s exact range and altitude capabilities against various types of targets are classified, but it’s clear that the updated missile will allow MIM-104 Patriot batteries to cover far more area and have greater defensive capabilities against tactical ballistic missiles than its progenitors. The upgrades to the missile’s motor, control system, software, front-end thermal protection, among other modifications, result in a far more effective weapon. The type will also serve as the baseline missile for the international Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) initiative. With the proliferation of theater ballistic missiles, both by state and non-state actors alike, a more capable Patriot missile adapted to counter these threats will be hot sellers. The reawakening of a the Russian Bear, whose Iskander tactical ballistic missiles are a forward-deployed weapon of choice, as well the ever-evolving threat posed by North Korea , and maybe most of all, the use of increasingly longer-ranged ballistic missiles by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, have collectively pushed the ballistic missile threat at the top of defense planners’ minds. This has resulted in recent sales of the Patriot missile system to Romania , Poland , and Sweden , and more are likely to follow. Lockheed The Patriot’s recent performance against Houthi fired missiles may not be as illustrious as many tout, and the idea of a “missile shield” isn’t really based in reality—both are issues we have discussed in detail in the past—but having some terminal defense capabilities to protect key locales against the most prevalent ballistic missile classes is still a very worthy endeavor. Especially when that same battery can also provide area air defense against air-breathing threats such as aircraft, cruise missiles , and even against small drones, as well. More elaborate purpose-built missile defense systems don’t have this flexibility, but this newest version of the Patriot missile is well suited to make up the lower tier of a “layered” ballistic missile defense system. The good news is that after being in service for nearly three and a half decades, the Patriot continues to evolve and becoming more potent and flexible, and the Patriot PAC-3 MSE update really gives the system a big leap in capability that it needs. It also seems like a great foundation for future advances, such as the possibility of incorporating a dual-mode seeker design .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 13, 2017",The Course To A 355 Ship Navy Is Becoming Increasingly Challenging To Plot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There is a lot of soaring rhetoric filled with grand hopes and dreams when it comes to achieving a 355 ship U.S. Navy fleet in the coming decades, but it’s clear that the sea going service will have a much harder time finding a way to reach that goal than many would like to believe. Tough decisions that are critical to realizing a larger naval end strength, some of which include breaking with decades of established habits, many of which run counter to massive shipbuilding special interest influences, are fast approaching, or in some cases, they have already come and gone. At every turn there is a risk and reward proposition, but the idea that the Navy will build its way to its 355 ship goal alone is a losing mindset that serves to satisfy the shipbuilding special interests and the Pentagon’s obsession with obtaining new platforms at great cost over affordably updating the ones it already owns. Also, this grand wish for a 355 ship fleet—it has about 275 ships today—sits against the harsh reality that the Navy is already tired and fractured. The fact that in the span of a handful of months the service had put two major surface combatants out of action and lost many lives in the process due to its own systemic failings underlines this truth. But just the Navy’s near-term procurement and force structure choices for its surface combatant fleet alone can make or break the prospects of achieving its grand goal, notwithstanding the many other issues it currently faces. Tico Twilight? One of the most critical conundrums facing the Navy and its future force structure objectives is what to do with its aging Ticonderoga class cruisers. These vessels offer command and control and weapons capacity that their increasingly complex Arleigh Burke class destroyer counterparts don’t. The oldest eleven of these ships—half of the active cruiser fleet—are approaching the end of their predetermined service lives and are slated to be decommissioned at a rate of two per year starting in 2020. But with some upgrade and sustainment dollars they could continue to provide a unique set of highly important capabilities for many years to come. USS Lake Champlain CG-57, USN By most accounts there is indeed a lot of life left in these vessels, but everything from the ships’ increasingly finicky and maintenance intensive SPY-1 radar to their piping and mechanical systems would need TLC or replacement in order to realize an extended service life. The vessel’s radar in particular needs a major upgrade to keep it not only viable, but even reliable on any level if the ships are to remain in the fleet. There is no easy answer to this issue as the radar cannot be swapped out for the far heavier SPY-6 air and missile defense radar (AMDR) that is slated to outfit the Navy’s upcoming super-sized variant of its Arleigh Burke class destroyers. Nearly half of the Arleigh Burke class design is being redesigned to accommodate this new, larger, solid-state radar system, making it almost an entirely new class of ship onto itself. The Ticonderoga class and its already overloaded hull and cracking aluminum superstructure won’t benefit from the luxury of such an elaborate redesign. Some have suggested going for the truncated version of the SPY-6 that could find itself on a future U.S. Navy frigate, but equipping a mighty cruiser with a similar radar system as what may soon be found on a frigate doesn’t sound too attractive even though it would likely be a major step up in some capability areas over the troublesome phased arrays currently fitted. USS Bunker Hill CG-52, USN Regardless of what format a Ticonderoga class upgrade would take, the biggest challenge will be getting the funding to make those upgrades a reality. It seems like the Navy and congress all agree that they need to extend the service life of these ships, but at the same time getting the money set aside to do so soon will likely remain a major challenge. There is also the issue that any comprehensive life extension initiative for these ships will eat into shipbuilding funds and could impact other priorities. And just getting upgrades and refits scheduled will be increasingly challenging as these ships creep toward retirement and their condition continues to deteriorate. Without clear planning, these vessels could end up being sidelined due to backlogs of other naval work and as long-lead items needed for their upgrades are procured. All this could make them even less attractive for a life extension program as time moves on, thus making the Navy’s 355 ship goal even less attainable. Burke Block Buy? The backbone of the proposed 355 ship U.S. Navy fleet will be the Arleigh Burke class destroyer in its multiple forms. The next generation Arleigh Burke class design, known as the Flight III configuration, borders on an entirely new class. As we mentioned earlier, nearly half the ship has been redesigned. This includes major changes to its hull-form and its superstructure. Many of these changes were made to accommodate the solid-state SPY-6 AMDR radar arrays, which are larger and feature a far denser weight distribution than their predecessors. The ship also features a hybrid-electric drive system and other improvements. Flight III design changes. , GAO The advent of the Flight III configuration is at least partially the result of the drastically curtailed DDG-1000 Zumwalt class destroyer program that was the victim of chronic cost cutting and dwindling capabilities requirements throughout its decade long design phase. You can read all about this travesty in this past feature . With the first of the Flight III Burkes slated to be delivered in 2023, the big question facing the Navy and Congress is whether or not to do a block buy of 10 ships to hopefully lower the type’s unit price. Basically, buying 10 of these totally unproven vessels will supposedly save 10 percent. So basically buy 10 ships and get one free. The problem with this is that the design, although based on the proven Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class, is largely new, as are many of its sub-systems, so putting 10 ships into production, each costing billions of dollars, without even testing a prototype first could result in a procurement disaster. The practice of putting something into production before testing it—or even finishing designing it—is called concurrency and it has plagued other high profile programs in recent years, like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , Littoral Combat Ship , and Ford class supercarrier. Tyler Rogoway The Navy says that the entire ship is designed in a 3D virtual environment down to the nuts and bolts, which sounds impressive, but we have heard that type of claim before and the outcome wasn’t all that rosy. Many worry that even with a good design compiled via the best CAD tools available it still doesn’t mean the shipyard or the Navy knows exactly what one of these ships will cost until they actually build one. If 10 are bought at one time, savings could be left on the table or the overruns could be massive. Defense News quoted Bryan McGrath, a retired destroyer captain and consultant with The Ferrybridge Group about the bulk buy and its drawbacks: “Everyone is just sort of guessing what it will cost… When the shipyards are bidding on a multiyear on a design that includes as much immaturity as this one does, they have to price that risk… One outcome is they overprice the risk and the taxpayers pay, or they underprice the risk and the taxpayers pay, or they get it right. But the reality is that these sort of risk calculations are difficult to get right… I am a big believer in the Flight III DDG and the direction it’s going, but the differences between it and the IIA are considerable. Substantial enough to warrant prudence, and that to me means each shipyard building at least a number of these successfully before we go to a multiyear procurement… I can see a day where we have the DDG 51 program manager and the assistant secretary of the Navy for research and development called before the SASC, six to 10 years from now to answer for cost overruns that were wholly foreseeable given the risk of moving from a IIA to a Flight III.” Christening of the USS Michael Murphy DDG-112., USN One option may be to continue building Flight IIAs, which are still in production, while the first pair of Flight III ships are being tested, and then begin high-rate production of Flight III ships via a bulk buy once the design hasn’t finished testing. This won’t deliver new capabilities to the fleet as fast as the concurrency route, but it will keep the production line warm, drastically lower risk, and it would allow for small improvements to the Flight III design to be made before buying the ships in bulk. If this approach isn’t taken, and the Flight III ships run into major development issues while under bulk concurrent production and testing, it could cause a logjam in the shipyards that would impact the Navy’s dream of a 355 ship fleet significantly. Passing On The Perrys? One of these critical decisions that seems to have already been made concerns what the Navy plans to do with its mothballed fleet of Oliver Hazard Perry class (FFG-7) frigates. It was originally thought that the Navy could economically upgrade these vessels in a similar fashion as allied nations have, some of which have taken the surplus fighting ships and modernized their combat systems and weaponry. That idea was quickly jettisoned by the Navy’s brass. Then the 10 frigates—or the best seven of the lot—were being eyed for regeneration with nearly no upgrades at all. The idea was to deliver them “navigation and radar ready” multi-functional functional platforms. USS Samuel B. Roberts FFG-58, USN These vessels would execute low-end missions in low-threat environments, such as counter-narcotics missions and anti-piracy operations. This would allow higher-end ships to be freed up for more complex and demanding missions. Very recently the Navy swatted down this idea as well due to costs—a claim that is dubious at best upon closer review. The Navy has since officially obligated Littoral Combat Ships and Spearhead class logistical vessels to the counter-narcotics mission in the coming years. This decision seems like a big glaring missed opportunity. At the very least the seven best FFG-7 hulls could have been returned to the fleet to help the Navy reach its 355 ship goal, and it’s not like they aren’t going to commit existing resources to what would have been the regenerated Perry class’s intended mission sets. Fresh Frigate Hope? An all new frigate—something many of us have been desperately pleading for for years—could be key in offsetting these and other hurdles the Navy will face on its journey to realize a 355 ship navy. Now known officially as the FFG(X), this program aims to step in partially where the Littoral Combat Ship program failed and bring additional higher-end capabilities to table. The type could go a long way in providing multi-role capabilities that would take the pressure off of the Navy’s over-tasked destroyer fleet, freeing those ships up for more demanding missions. If this vessel can be produced relatively quickly, in significant numbers, and comparatively cheaply, the Navy could even decide to trade a bit of its future high-end combat power for a bit more middle-end combat power. This new frigate, which is due to hit the water in 2023, as is the Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyer, with the Navy evaluating sensors, weapons, and hull designs now. The ship will be highly capable of “blue water” operations far out to sea for extended periods of time as part of a larger networked surface action group, carrier strike group, or expeditionary strike group, or independently. The ship will also be capable of surviving in higher threat environments, something the Littoral Combat Ship stands little chance of doing. Area air defense with at least the capability to employ RIM-166 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles is a given, as well as an over the horizon anti-surface and strike capability. Basically we are talking about a real fighting ship that will create a new bridge between the anemic and single mission-focused Littoral Combat Ship and the mighty Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Ingalls Patrol Frigate, which has been shown in multiple configurations and is based on the Coast Guard’s Legend class cutters, is a favorite for FFG(X)., Ingalls Shipbuilding Hope Float On A Good Plan And A Steady Stream Of Dollars. Regardless of any of these choices, the Navy’s big goal is predicated on having a reliable defense budget. You can have the best plan imaginable to achieve a 355 ship Navy, but if the dollars are always in limbo, that stellar plan can become its own nightmare. But still, at least having a comprehensive plan would help guide funding in a positive way, show that the goal is indeed attainable, and to build broad support for it, but so far the Navy still hasn’t produced one. One positive sign would be if at least some sort of real priority would be placed on using the assets the Navy already owns to help in achieving its goal instead of being so highly focused on procuring expensive new vessels. Passing over the Oliver Hazard Perry class seems like more of the same for Navy, not a creative new way forward, and securing the future of the 11 oldest Ticonderoga class cruisers now seems like an absolutely essential initiative, not just to help reach the 355 ship goal, but also for overall national security in the near term. In fact, those cruisers act as a sort of “canary in the coal mine” from which to gauge the plausibility that the Navy and congress can get their acts together enough to have any shot at achieving the 355 ship goal. If they can’t smoothly save those ships from being sidelined or mothballed, than there is little hope that such a large fleet will ever come to pass. BAE Systems is looking to pitch a version of their new Type 26 frigate for the FFG(X) tender., BAE Systems As for block buys of Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers, the Navy would be better off continuing production of the current Flight IIA design and testing the first examples of the Flight III design thoroughly before committing to a block purchase worth tens of billions of dollars. And once again, the wild card when it comes to the Navy’s surface combatant fleet is the FFG(X). It looks like the Navy has finally come to its senses as far as what it needs in this class of ship, and it could just prove to be so capable for the money that a few less destroyers will be needed down the line.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 4, 2018",Russia’s Air Base In Syria Seems To Be Under Regular Attack Now,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following a deadly attack on Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria on December 31st, which killed at least two servicemen and damaged or destroyed aircraft based there, it now seems as if the base is coming under attack on a fairly regular basis according to reports. Days before the deadly New Years Eve attack that we still know little about, on December 27th, another onslaught of artillery occurred. Two of the rockets were supposedly shot down by Pantsir-S1 point air defense systems while at least one other impacted outside the base. Just hours ago, on January 6th, 2018, reports of another attack on the base began emerging, this one supposedly coming from weaponized drones. Although these aren’t the first attacks on the base, three attacks in ten days seem like a significant uptick in enemy action for an installation that is supposedly situated in largely non-hostile territory. And these are only the attacks that have been more widely reported, some sources say there have been multiple weaponized drone attacks just in a single day. We reported on an official list posted last Summer that shows engagements by Russian air defense systems in Syria up until that time in 2017. Clearly the frequency of these events have escalated since then as the list shows only four engagements at Russia’s air base, three of which involved artillery rockets and one having been against a balloon: The enemy’s ability to rapidly adapt their hardware and tactics, especially when it comes to the use of weaponized drones, is something we have noted repeatedly in conflict zones in the Middle East. In Yemen, Houthi rebels, with the help of Iranian backers, have actually employed small drones in the destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) role. Prior to this, such a capability was only available to state actors, with Israel being the leader in this unique weapons space. Russia air base south of Latakia is surrounded by fields, structures, and urban areas, making its defense somewhat complex. , Google Earth Using different construction materials, guidance concepts, and attack profiles, the enemy can learn what works best to thwart point air defense systems. And that process of trial and error seems to be underway in these latest instances. As small drone capabilities become increasingly complex and accessible, the threat they will pose to forward-deployed forces will skyrocket. If, or should I say when, they reach the sophistication level of a credible swarm , they will become exceptionally disruptive. There is no known and robust kinetic defensive capability able to counter this type of threat at this time. S400 SAM launchers and air defense assets seen at Russia’s air base south of Latakia. , PAUL GYPTEAU/AFP/Getty Images As for who is executing these attacks and how they are pulling them off in or near regime controlled territory, there has been worry for some time that as government forces and their Russian and Iranian backed comrades, along with U.S. led coalition backed forces, retake large swathes of territory from rebel and extremist elements, many of these fighters would break up into smaller cells and melt into the populous. In a limited number of ways this far more diffused threat poses a larger danger to the Assad regime and its external backers than a highly centralized one. The move away from more traditional military tactics to ones that are more insurgent-like in nature is one of them. Weaponized drones are especially attractive for this type of warfare because they can be built in large quantities clandestinely in an urban environment and they are a standoff weapon that allows the user to have a high chance of survivability after their employment. They also put high-value targets that are well defended against a ground infiltration within a single operator’s reach. Russia’s main base in Syria is clearly the juiciest of almost all targets imaginable for such hostile actors. If these factors are indeed at play, these attacks are likely to become even more frequent as time goes on. President Putin just made a high-profile and triumphant trip to the base to declare victory in Syria alongside embattled Syrian ruler Bashar al Assad., Mikhail KlimentyevTASS via Getty Images The big question is what type of impact increased attacks on Russia’s primary Syrian base could have. Vladimir Putin recently traveled to the outpost to declare victory against ISIS and anti-Assad forces in Syria. Continued attacks on the high-profile base would tell a different story, and if losses mount, the situation could potentially prove problematic for the Russian President, especially during an election cycle. But above anything else, these attacks are likely an indicator of how the conflict in Syria will morph in the coming months and even years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 5, 2020",India’s First Ballistic Missile Sub Sidelined For Nearly A Year Following Mishap,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India’s very first nuclear ballistic missile carrying submarine (SSBN), the INS Arihant, has been pier-side undergoing repairs for ten months following a totally avoidable accident. The news comes as India struggles to move from an all diesel-electric fleet of submarines to a mixed fleet featuring much larger and more complicated boats. The sidelining of Arihant in particular is especially troublesome as the submarine represents a very high-priority strategic weapons project for an increasingly powerful India, and the future of the country’s second-strike nuclear deterrent depends on the submarine class. The incident resulted from a hatch being mistakenly left open near the rear of the hull of the multi-billion dollar submarine while it was docked. Water came rushing into the vessel’s nuclear propulsion compartment doing significant damage to the sensitive systems and infrastructure located there. Large sections of pipes had to be cut away in the aftermath, further complicated the repair effort. The vessel is powered by an 83 megawatt pressurized light-water reactor that uses enriched uranium fuel. Arihant was just commissioned in August of 2016, meaning that it was operational for only about six months before taking critical damage. Russian media says the vessel was returned recently to service, but there is no corroborating proof of that claim at this time. India has been very tight lipped about their SSBN project, dubbed the Advanced Technology Vessel. Very few pictures of the submarine exist publicly and the level of damage to INS Arihant is just being reported on now. India’s nuclear submarine program as a whole has hit a rough patch in recent months as its other nuclear powered submarine, the fast attack boat I NS Chakra, took damage last October to its sonar dome while pulling into Visakhapatnam harbor located on the Bay of Bengal. A five foot hole was punched in the bow of the submarine and Russian experts were on scene in December trying to figure out how best to fix the damage. INS Chakra started out life in Russia as the Nerpa (K-152), with construction beginning in 1993. The Akula class fast attack submarine sat in a partially built state for a decade and a half before India sponsored the rest of its construction and sea trails. The finished Nerpa was launched in 2008 and by 2012 she was turned over to the Indian Navy under a ten year lease arrangement as the renamed Chakra . Years before taking possession of the potent fast attack sub from Russia, another mishap aboard the boat left dozens injured or killed. The event occurred during a 2008 test mission in the Pacific when the submarine was loaded with over 200 sailors and civilian workers. The fire extinguishing system was accidentally set off and it automatically sealed a number of compartments and flooded them with Halon gas with little warning, suffocating to death some occupants and injuring others. The cause of incident was blamed on human error and faults in the automated system. It was the worst Russian submarine disaster since the sinking of the Kursk in 2000. INS Chakra , Ajai Shukla/wikicommons Accidents aside, India now wants to lease a second Akula class submarine from Russia, but the original lease of the Chakra not only gave the Indian Navy an advanced nuclear fast attack submarine capability, but it also allowed it to gain knowledge on how to operate and sustain such a complex vessel. With a lot of help from Russia, the Akula class design was partially ported over as part of the Advanced Technology Vessel program, with some of the type’s components being adapted for use in a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) platform. Four additional boats in the class are slated to join Arihant in the future. Together they will serve as the backbone of India’s survivable nuclear deterrent. With five boats in the fleet, at least one, and more usually two will be able to be on patrol at any given time. The baseline design is capable of holding up to 12 K-15 “Sagarika” short-range nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, three of which can be packed into each of the submarine’s four vertical launch tubes. Each missile is thought to be highly accurate but has a relatively short range of around 450 to 1200 miles depending on the payload weight. K-15 SLBM, Indian Navy A larger missile is under development for the class as well— the intermediate-range K-4 SLBM. When this missile is ready to be deployed, the Arihant will be able to accommodate four of them. This number will expand to eight missiles with the second boat in the class, the INS Aridhaman, which has already been launched, as well as those that follow. The slightly larger and more capable INS Aridhaman is slated to become operational in 2019 and it will also feature other differences as well, including upgrades in reactor power, new indigenously-built sonar and integrated combat systems, enhanced communications, and other smaller differences. All this points to the real possibility that as India’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent grows, the less capable INS Arihant may end up serving as something of a technology demonstrator and training vessel as much as one that focuses on nuclear deterrent patrols. Lessons learned from the Arihant program will also be rolled into an upcoming initiative to procure six indigenously built nuclear fast attack submarines. The Indian Navy is prepared to spend a lot of money to totally revamp its submarine capabilities over the coming decade, and is engaging foreign submarine manufacturers heavily to see that it happens. Currently India’s submarine fleet is mainly made up of aging Russian diesel-electric boats, and the fleet’s readiness is far from stellar. But with such a large investment in new submarine capabilities, India seems willing to accept a steep learning curve and the risks that go along with it to realize a first-rate underwater warfare capability. Mahendra Parikh/Hindustan Times via Getty Images Much of this is spurred by the advances in Chinese submarine technology and the country’s overall expansion of its military might over the last decade and a half. With tensions mounting between the two countries, India clearly thinks it needs a highly credible second-strike nuclear deterrent to maintain some level strategic parity. Additionally, considering New Delhi has a no first strike policy, rendering a highly credible survivable second strike deterrent is especially important. The region overall is quite wary of China’s increasing strength and geopolitical assertiveness, and considering shipping and enforcement of territorial claims are such sensitive topics for major players in the region, the submarine remains a very relevant offensive and defensive tool. There is also India’s old foe Pakistan, who is trying to field its own second-strike deterrent in the form of nuclear-armed submarine-launched cruise missiles fired from its diesel-electric submarines. This capability isn’t anywhere near as robust as fielding a SSBN that can hide underwater for months at a time and can fire ballistic missiles from unpredictable locales. But still, it is a nuclear armed submarine capable of standoff attacks, and other countries, namely Israel , relies on a similar submarine-based nuclear deterrent. India has six French designed Scorpène class AIP capable diesel-electric attack submarines planned, but the program which includes a large degree of technology transfer, remains behind schedule, with only one of the boats commissioned so far. But once online, the submarines will present a capable mid-level multi-role submarine force. , Kunal Patil/Hindustan Times via Getty Images Regardless of its peer-state competitors or its current state of readiness, it is a very certain bet that India’s submarine force as a whole will look very different in a decade than it does today. Paired with its other major naval programs, including the eventual fielding of a number of advanced aircraft carriers , the country’s ability to control the seas around shores and project power beyond will be far greater than it is today. But the ultimate weapon on planet earth remains the SSBN, and regardless of the bumps along the way, India is already well on its way to achieving a credible second-strike deterrent.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Houthi Rebels Release FLIR Video Showing Shoot Down of Saudi F-15S Over Yemen (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Houthi rebels have released video they claim shows the exact moment they shot down Royal Saudi Air Force F-15S over Yemen. The Iranian-supported militants appear to have at least tracked the jet using a repurposed FLIR Systems Star SAFIRE sensor turret, which features an infrared camera. On Jan. 8, 2018, the Houthis released the infrared video footage, which shows the FLIR Systems logo in the frame, via its Al Masirah television network. A separate statement from the group’s Saba News Agency says their forces shot down the aircraft with an unspecified surface-to-air missile. The complete video also shows the sensor turret on an improvised ground mount. The F-15S fighter appears to increase speed and releases decoy flares before a projectile hits it, appearing to cause significant damage. The fate of the pilots is unknown at this time. The Houthis say this is separate from a claim they made on Jan. 7, 2018, about having downed a Saudi Tornado swing-wing attack aircraft. The Saudi state-run news agency SPA confirmed that crash , but said it was the result of a technical fault, not enemy action. The Saudi-led coalition recovered the aircraft’s two pilots in that incident. https://youtube.com/watch?v=a7sn6ybiOZQ In October 2017, the Houthis shot down a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone flying over Yemen . That incident reportedly involved a shoulder-fired man-portable air-defense system, or MANPADS. UPDATE: 3:00pm PST— There is a distinct possibility that the United States might have supplied the FLIR Systems turret the Yemenis claimed to have employed during this shoot down. In July 2009, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Pentagon’s main arms broker, approved a so-called Pseudo-Foreign Military Sales, or Pseudo-FMS, deal that included three Ultra 8500 turrets “or equivalent,” as well as other equipment and contractor support. The full package, intended as an upgrade for Yemen’s Huey II helicopters, had an estimated value of more than $3.7 million. The Ultra 8500s by themselves were worth more than $600,000 apiece. US Government via FOIA We do not know for sure if the Yemeni government took delivery of this equipment, though. Under the Pseudo-FMS process, the recipient does not have to sign anything in order to accept the aid and the Pentagon treats the arrangement as an internal transfer. The U.S. government crafted the process in 2006 as a means to speed up the delivery of certain types of equipment to allies and partners, particularly those engaged in fighting terrorist groups. US Government via FOIA If this turns out to be the case, it would be embarrassing for the United States, as well as FLIR Systems to a lesser degree. There is already evidence that the Houthis have been able to acquire other U.S.-government supplied arms and equipment, including .50 caliber Barrett M82 anti-materiel rifles. US Government via FOIA Otherwise, there is still relatively little information about what weapon the Houthis might have used or how they linked the FLIR turret directly to that system, if at all. Just using the sensor to track and monitor aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition, as well as film the engagements for propaganda purposes, would be a relatively simply affair. There is the possibility that militants used a MANPADS system, as they claimed in the case of the MQ-9 shoot down in October 2017. It is also possible that the Houthis may have repurposed infrared homing air-to-air missiles they captured from Yemeni government stockpiles or obtained from other sources into surface-to-air missiles. There would be some historical precedent for the latter type of improvised air defense system. Serbian forces employed modified Soviet AA-8 and AA-11 types during the fighting in the Balkans during the 1990s. The Houthis also claim to have reactivated at least one SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile system, including its Fan Song fire control radar. The group said it used one of these radio command guided weapons to knock down an American drone in January 2016, but this claim remains unsubstantiated. They may have also employed one of these missiles in their claimed shoot down of a Sudanese Su-24 Fencer attack aircraft in 2015. #Yemen |i Army used SAM S-75 to down a #US drone flying over #Sanaa https://t.co/ch0RgmSTug https://t.co/DEbNL0d8un via @M3t4_tr0n — Liveuamap MiddleEast (@lummideast) January 20, 2016 The use of a radar guided missile like the SA-2 would help explain why the missile was not confused by the release of decoy flares, and the reason that the aircrew eventually pushed the jet into a much higher thrust state even though doing so created a far larger infrared signature for a heat-seeking missile to home in on. In other words, the F-15’s crew may have been confused as to what type of threat it actually wise. Eventually, warnings in the cockpit from the aircraft’s radar warning receiver (RWR) would have also indicated that the missile was radar-guided. All this could have caught the pilots very off guard if they were loitering near or above the MANPADS envelope in an area where there really wasn’t supposed to be a standing threat from radar-guided SAMs. The video also does not show what happened to the F-15S after the apparent impact, so it is impossible to discern a potential weapon from the resulting damage. In 2015, the Houthis claimed to have shot down another Saudi F-15, but could only present photographs of a damaged AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, a drop tank, and a pylon as proof. This led some to suggest that the rebels had at best damaged the aircraft rather than shot it down. The Saudis did not confirm or deny that incident had occurred. We will continue to update this post as more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Says January 5th Attack On Its Syrian Air Base Was By A Swarm Of Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last Saturday I wrote about how Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria seemed to be coming under increasingly frequent attack in recent days, and noted that reports were streaming out of the area of a possible weaponized drone assault on the outpost that had occurred overnight between January 5th and 6th. All this came after another attack killed two soldiers and damaged aircraft on the airfield on New Years Eve, as well as other reported attacks in between and in the days prior. Now the Russian Ministry of Defense has detailed just how unique the attack on the night of January 5th-6th actually was, and it offers a bleak and sobering preview of what I have been saying for years would be a future reality of warfare—the age of the militarized small drone swarm. Russia’s Ministry of Defense made the following press release early on January 8th, 2017: Security system of the Russian Khmeimim air base and Russian Naval CSS point in the city of Tartus successfully warded off a terrorist attack with massive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through the night of 5th – 6th January, 2018. As evening fell, the Russia air defence forces detected 13 unidentified small-size air targets at a significant distance approaching the Russian military bases. Ten assault drones were approaching the Khmeimim air base, and another three – the CSS point in Tartus. Six small-size air targets were intercepted and taken under control by the Russian EW units. Three of them were landed on the controlled area outside the base, and another three UAVs exploded as they touched the ground. Seven UAVs were eliminated by the Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missile complexes operated by the Russian air defence units on 24-hours alert. The Russian bases did not suffer any casualties or damages. The Khmeimim air base and Russian Naval CSS point in Tartus are functioning on a scheduled basis. Currently, the Russian military experts are analyzing the construction, technical filling and improvised explosives of the captured UAVs. Having decoded the data recorded on the UAVs, the specialists found out the launch site. It was the first time when terrorists applied a massed drone aircraft attack launched at a range of more than 50 km using modern GPS guidance system. Technical examination of the drones showed that such attacks could have been made by terrorists at a distance of about 100 kilometers. Engineering decisions applied by terrorists while attacks on the Russian objects in Syria could be received from one of countries with high-technological capabilities of satellite navigation and remote dropping control of professionally assembled improvised explosive devices in assigned coordinates. All drones of terrorists are fitted with pressure transducers and altitude control servo-actuators. Terrorists’ aircraft-type drones carried explosive devices with foreign detonating fuses. The Russian specialists are determining supply channels, through which terrorists had received the technologies and devices, as well as examining type and origin of explosive compounds used in the IEDs. The fact of usage of strike aircraft-type drones by terrorists is the evidence that militants have received technologies to carry out terrorist attacks using such UAVs in any country.” A close-up of one of the captured drones. They are remarkably crude, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be deadly and effective. , Russian MoD First off, it’s interesting Russia is providing all this information on a threat to its own base. Who knows how accurate some of these details really are, but if the number of drones launched at the facility is anywhere near correct, it would seem to be the first self-contained, large scale, coordinated, standoff drone assault on a fixed installation like this. Also of note is the stated range of these drones—over 60 miles. That means they could be launched from well outside regime controlled territory, which makes countering them at their source extremely challenging. On the other hand, Russia could have specifically inserted this detail in its release to make it seem as if the nearby area around the base remains totally uncontested and not subject to a deteriorating security situation. Beyond the drone, rocket, and artillery threat, the Russian Air Force apparently sees shoulder-fired SAMs also as a threat in the immediate area, which points to the possibility that Russia is operating in a more troubled neighborhood than what the Ministry of Defense and the Assad regime commonly let on. Russia’s statement also insinuates that whoever is launching these drones, whether they are an anti-Assad rebel force or a terror related group, is getting some sort of external help in creating these improvised guided missiles of sorts. We’ll have to see where this road leads and if Russia begins to allude more clearly to the possibility that state actors may have some kind of a hand in these attacks. Russian MoD With modified tactics, these drones, which use GPS autopilot to make their attack runs, pose the risk of wreaking continuous havoc on Russia’s air operations in Syria. Considering the air base remains highly active, it’s not as if a Pantsir-S1 can just open up firing or launching missiles without regard to other aircraft operating in and around the air base. Also those cannon rounds aren’t likely t he self destructing type so they are going to land somewhere, as are at least parts of its missiles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9Oq3KMTZSJU But regardless of the direct implications this new tactic has on Russia’s Syrian operation, it does give us our first glimpses of a new age in modern warfare—one where dense swarms of low-cost drones armed with high-explosives will be able to wreak havoc on targets. Russian defenses, and those of other countries for that matter, may be able to fend off a handful of these improvised drones executing a very loosely coordinated attack, but a near peer-state competitor could field a much denser, more nimble, adaptable, and networked force. And as we have mentioned before, there is no known kinetic defense to counter such an attack. It seems that the age of drone swarms has arrived, and that’s a terrifying reality to comprehend.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Exclusive: New Photos Of Boeing’s MQ-25 Tanker Drone On The Ramp In St. Louis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have been closely tracking the slow motion unveiling of Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System ( CBARS ) drone. After initially releasing a single head-on picture of the aircraft on December 19th, 2017, last week Boeing released a short video montage giving us a quick and carefully edited splattering of new angles to digest. Some of the takeaways from this video were quite important, but it didn’t show the aircraft in its whole form, including its wings and rear quarter, nor did it offer any sense of scale. Now, thanks to one of our readers, we have our first full view images of the drone—including photos of its rear—as well as that previously missing sense of size. Jeremy McGough was flying out of St. Louis’s famous Lambert Field this morning when he noticed a very strange aircraft on one of the airport’s aprons near Boeing Defense’s sprawling plant. He snapped a few pictures and sent them our way to see if we could positively identify the mystery machine as Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker contender. It turns out Jeremy was right on the money, this was indeed Boeing Phantom Works’ CBARS drone, and although the photos are low resolution, we get to see this aircraft in an entirely new way. Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough Jeremy McGough A few quick takeaways from these photos: 1.) The aircraft’s lack of a traditional protruding air intake is very clear in these pictures, with its dorsal area appearing smooth, suggesting as we had speculated before that the intake is flush mounted with the top of the aircraft. 2.) The wings are long and somewhat slender, which points to a very efficient design for cruising and loitering up in the flight levels. Because the images have people and objects nearby we can begin to speculate on the wingspan of Boeing’s MQ-25. The War Zone’s initial estimates each wing being roughly 24 feet long, with a ten foot wide fuselage, resulting in an overall wingspan of around 58 feet. This is a very rough estimate and it could vary by as much as ten feet, but at least if gives us a general idea of scale. By comparison, the F/A-18 Super Hornet has a wingspan of 48 feet, eight and half inches. The F-14 Tomcat had a 64 foot wingspan and the E-2 Hawkeye has a span of 81 feet. The MQ-25’s height is estimated at around ten feet. 3.) We get our first look at the entire rear of the aircraft, and clearly the design features a planar exhaust. This feature is known to reduce infrared signature from all but the directly rearward perspective, and is especially effective when paired with a V-tail that protects direct line of sight to the exhaust from multiple angles. We still don’t know if any thrust deviator/basic two-dimensional thrust vectoring system is included in the design. Such a feature could help with lowering landing speeds during recovery aboard the carrier and would help get the aircraft airborne during launches, and could also prove to be useful for stabilizing the aircraft during refueling operations. 4.) As we mentioned in our last MQ-25 analysis piece , this aircraft was built around some clearly defined low-observable design principals that could likely be enhanced in future variations if this aircraft gets chosen by the Navy. And yes it does have a similar configuration to Northrop’s Tacit Blue, but so do other aircraft, including the RQ-4 Global Hawk and even one of Boeing’s own CBARS competitors, General Atomics’ naval tanker adaptation of their Predator-C/Avenger unmanned aircraft, among others. But those aircraft are all predated significantly by Boeing’s own Quiet Bird design from the early 1960s. But at its core, Boeing’s MQ-25 is a medium-altitude/medium-endurance (MAME) unmanned platform which could be adapted to perform a whole series of roles beyond that of an aerial tanker. Boeing’s Quiet Bird predates Tacit Blue and even Lockheed’s Have Blue demonstrator by over a decade and it has some common features with the company’s new MQ-25 design., Boeing What we don’t know is why the aircraft was rolled out to such a visible area today. Maybe engine runs or taxi tests are beginning or the aircraft was going to be photographed in that location for some purpose. Boeing has said that they don’t intend on flying the prototype, at least for the CBARS competition, unless they win the initial contract that will down-select a single vendor to build a handful of early test airframes before the decision is made to put the type into full-rate production.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 13, 2017",New Frigate Program Heats Up As U.S. Navy Says It Will Pay Nearly $1B Per Ship,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Navy struggles to overcome multiple obstacles on its way to what it hopes will become a 355 ship Navy in the coming decades, the procurement of a guided missile frigate is becoming a top priority, and that’s a very good thing. Known as FFG(X), the program is really gaining steam with the Navy just announcing possibly the most important metric related to the entire program—what the Navy is willing to pay for each new frigate. The project manager for the Navy’s future frigate initiative, Regan Campbell, stated on Tuesday that the Navy will be willing to fork over $950M for each of the 20 ships it currently plans on buying, aside from the first prototype ship that will cost more. This figure puts the notional FFG(X) squarely in the middle price-wise between an Arleigh Burke class destroyer and a Littoral Combat Ship, and that makes a lot of sense as the FFG(X) aims to bridge the glaring capabilities gap that exists between these two surface combatant types. Defense contractors from around the globe are seeing this program as a rare opportunity to get a foothold in shipbuilding for the U.S. Navy, and multiple existing foreign designs could potentially be adapted for the Navy’s use. This is in addition to well-established domestic vendors that will be competing for the opportunity with their own designs as well. Supposedly about eight designs are being looked at by the Navy, all of which were submitted following the service’s initial RFP that was released last year. Campbell told attendees of the Surface Navy Association’s annual conference and trade show that the force is going to issue up to half a dozen preliminary contracts to entrants so that they can fully spec out their proposals based on more detailed forthcoming requirements. The final award is tentatively planned for 2020, with the first ship being delivered in 2023. USNI reports Campbell said the following as to how the Navy plans on giving feedback about the designs it likes before selecting the winner: “We’re going to have a technical review of each of these proposals by the end and provide them feedback in where these designs might need some buffing up to get to a full and open competition… You will see those requests for proposals by the fourth quarter of 2019 with an award in 2020.” Basic FFG(X) requirements, according to the RFP: “Threshold values from the Navy’s top level FFG(X) requirements are listed in Table 1 below.  The Navy considers the Threshold values to be the minimum acceptable level of performance for the FFG(X).  The Navy is not specifying Objective values at this time, but is interested in Industry concepts that affordably exceed the Threshold values for enhanced capability.  If the values in Table 1 can be exceeded for minimal cost increases, please identify those specific areas.  Additionally, if any specific threshold value drives a clear sensitivity break point in design such that lowering it would provide additional flexibility or significant cost savings to the Navy, provide a description of the issue and preferred mitigations.  The Navy is interested in understanding the tradeoffs, if any, between design changes to meet or exceed threshold requirements and impacts on recurring production costs for those designs.  In order to better understand the Navy’s priority of systems and desired capabilities, Tiers 1 – 3 are outlined against the Navy top level requirements in Table 1, with Tier 1 as the most desired.  If tradeoffs are necessary in the threshold attributes to minimize cost while maximizing capability, vendors are encouraged to trade off the lower tier elements prior to considering higher Tier elements (Tier 1 highest, Tier 3 lowest).”, USN The good news is that the Navy is open to a license-built variant of an existing foreign design, and that the FFG(X) won’t be a some watered-down or wanna-be fighting ship—lessons learned from recent high-profile and partially failed projects, namely the Littoral Combat Ship and the Zumwalt class destroyer , are clearly at play in their decision making. The initial requirement will be for the FFG(X) to feature 16 Mark 41 vertical launch system cells, but a target of 32 seems more likely. These cells will be stuffed with four Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles each, or they could accept a single larger missile like the latest generation of SM-2 Standard missile. But the SM-6 in particular would give these frigates a highly flexible long-range weapon capable of air defense, terminal anti-ballistic missile defense, and even surface and land-attack. Deploying the Tomahawk cruise missile and ASROC anti-submarine missile might also be an option. With 32 cells to play with, an FFG(X) could have its arsenal tailored to its mission. For anti-air warfare dominated missions, such as convoy escort duty, the ship could deploy with 48 ESSMs and 24 SM-2s or SM-6s. On a multi-role mission, such as an independent patrol, the vessels could deploy with 24 ESSMs, 12 SM-6s or SM-6s, 6 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and 8 RUM-139 VL-ASROC anti-submarine missiles. For strike-oriented missions, the ships could deploy with 24 ESSMs and 26 Tomahawk missiles. Even without Tomahawk or ASROC capability, the ability to provide area air defense alone would take a lot of pressure off the Navy’s overworked destroyer fleet. The ships will also be outfitted with a dedicated over-the-horizon surface strike capability, such as Kongsberg’s flexible Naval Strike Missile (NSM). This multi-mode missile could provide a standoff strike capability if the Tomahawk won’t be integrated as part of the ship’s final configuration. The NSM is competing to become the Navy’s next generation canister-launched anti-ship missile under an initiative called the Over The Horizon Missile program. Raytheon is also competing for the contract. Some proposed FFG(X) entrants also include a short-range surface-to-surface missile capability to defend against swarm attacks, like the naval Longbow Hellfire missile being adapted for use by Littoral Combat Ships. This is laid out as a second-tier wanted capability in the Navy’s RFP. It may turn out that some of the designs can accommodate either 32 VLS cells or 16 VLS cells and a short-range surface-to-surface weapon system. FFG(X) will also be equipped with a version of the Aegis derived COMBATSS-21 combat system, and the Navy wants the ship’s primary sensor to be a truncated version of the scalable Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar system , but there are other sensor systems contenders waiting in the wings. Saab in particular wants to try to get their latest version of the Sea Giraffe radar , which has been given the U.S. designation AN/SPS-77, included in frigate’s sensor suite, even if to supplement its primary radar system. Saab vice president and general manager of the company’s sensor systems division, Jay Abendroth, said the following to Defensenews.com : “Right now, EASR is the main surveillance radar on there… What they are going to expect the frigate to do does open a lot of potentials, because again it’s not just about air surveillance with this set of radars, it gets a lot more into the other missions—navigation and other things—that might not actually be required of EASR. There may be other radar or sensor packages that will do those missions as well.” AN/SPS-77 is already being used by the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, and a modified version of it will be fielded on the US Coast Guard’s Offshore Patrol Cutters. It will also be installed on American supercarriers and landing helicopter docks as a secondary radar system. The Navy’s new frigate will also be able to field at least one MH-60R and one MQ-8C, along with SeaRAM for close-in protection, two seven-meter RHIBs, two types of towed sonar arrays and one fixed variable depth sonar system, Mk110 57mm deck gun, the highly capable SLQ-32(V)6 electronic warfare suite, and a bunch of other baseline systems requirements you can see below: Per the RFP: “Table 2 lists the notional FFG(X) Major Weapons Systems that will be provided as government furnished equipment.  In Table 2, Tiers 1 and 2 are outlined against the Navy warfare systems, with Tier 1 again being the most desired.  Values for these systems in terms of Space, Weight, Power and Cooling required can be made available upon request.  In the event the integration of the Major Weapon System elements in Table 2 drives a significant design change to accommodate, the vendor is requested to highlight this area and address what could be accomplished without significant design change, how much NRE would be avoided, and what the resultant design would include.  In addition to identifying cost drivers, vendors are also encouraged to provide design costs, average follow costs, and specifics on designs that will accommodate all the GFE systems and threshold performance requirements.”, USN USN We recently broke down the challenges facing the Navy when it comes to trying to realize its 355 ship fleet dream in the coming decades, and how the FFG(X) could very well help make that dream a reality. Seeing that a clearer picture is being painted of how well outfitted these ships will be, and the money the Navy is willing to spend on them, the possibility that once the design is operational and is deemed a success, the seagoing service could opt to divert more funds toward additional frigates beyond the 20 planned. Without attempting to look too far into the future, it’s clear that the FFG(X), a vessel many of us have been begging for for years, is turning out to be one of the Navy’s most promising and downright exciting programs. Indeed, it looks like a frigate renaissance is underway within the U.S. Navy. Better late than never.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 16, 2018","Here’s What The B-2’s Arrival In Guam Means For North Korea, The Olympics, And More","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was just a matter of time before B-2s stealth bombers would once again take up station on the American Pacific island outpost of Guam, but the timing of their arrival is especially impactful regardless of if the deployment was long-planned or quickly devised. In August of 2016, B-1B bombers arrived at Andersen Air Force base on Guam to fulfill U.S. Pacific Command’s continuous bomber assurance and deterrence mission. It was the first time the “Bone” had taken up station on Guam in over a decade, as the jets had spent years becoming the heavy-hitting all stars of America’s air campaigns in the Middle East. Since then the B-52H has taken the B-1B’s place in that troubled region , meanwhile a handful of B-1Bs have prowled around eastern Asia for a year and half, most famously flying near constant “show of force” missions near North Korean borders. USAF Now a trio of B-2As and 200 airmen to support them have arrived on Guam to augment , or even possibly relieve the B-1s deployed there. But the bat-winged bomber’s presence there, or even a changing of the guard, isn’t just about swapping one bomber out for another or adding more blunt firepower to the region. The B-2 brings highly unique capabilities to the theatre, ones that would be absolutely essential if the U.S. were to go after Kim Jong Un’s regime, or even move to attack a far more limited target set in North Korea. Primarily the B-2 brings an American airborne strategic nuclear strike capability back to the region—the B-1B’s ability to employ nuclear weapons having been stripped from the type’s mission set decades ago. But beyond that and the B-2’s famed ability to penetrate deep into hostile territory undetected to drop as many as 80 independently guided weapons on a single run, the stealth bomber also brings the ability to attack with the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). I described this unique role in a previous piece about the B-2’s brief presence in the Pacific theatre that occurred last October: “The 40,000lb super-bunker buster will be absolutely essential for any major air war aimed at wiping out North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, as well as for destroying key regime targets, many of which are buried under mountains. Short of nuclear weapons, no other penetrating munition on earth stands a chance at destroying these targets, with temporarily sealing their entrances being the only other possibly feasible option short of a commando raid. As we have discussed in detail before , the B-2 will be essential in any war plan against North Korea. It will serve to drop MOPs on key targets as well as executing destruction of enemy air defenses missions against North Korea’s fixed air defense system sites and airfields.” USAF Basically, if a war were to be launched against North Korea, or even if a “bloody nose” operation was launched as has been touted as a possibility in the press as of late, the B-2 would be in the region, if not as the first manned asset to fly over the country than as contingency for the possibility that Pyongyang chooses to escalate following a limited standoff strike. So is the B-2’s presence on the island a harbinger of large-scale destruction to come? Possibly. USAF There are a few interconnected twines we need to unwind here. First off, as noted earlier, we don’t know for sure if this deployment was long-scheduled, accelerated, or sudden, nor do we know how long it will last. Second, the Trump Administration has looked to continuously increase pressure on the Kim Regime, and quite frankly, they are out of military tools to do so— aside from the B-2 taking up semi-permanent station in the region once again. Bomber flights toward North Korea’s borders, those so called “show of force fights,” would take on an entirely new level of significance if the bombers used could disappear suddenly off radar and can be loaded up to deliver a pair of the largest bunker buster bombs in the world or even nuclear weapons. Donald Trump has no qualms about mentioning the possibility of putting America’s nuclear arsenal to use if he thinks the circumstances see fit, and the B-2 would be a credible and highly flexible delivery system to make good on those threats. USAF All this is occurring as North Korea is now sitting down with South Korea for talks. Some see this as the regime possibly coming to the table to eventually make some type of sweeping deal that could include the country giving up its nuclear arsenal and strategic missile programs, but that is extremely unlikely. Although the talks are a welcome development and a worthy endeavor, they show all the signs of a cunning move on behalf of Pyongyang to drive a “wedge of interests” between the U.S. and South Korea when it comes to overall strategy—namely the Trump Administrations demand that any talks the U.S. is a part of have to have the agreed upon intention of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. That almost laughably audacious and illogical goal will likely be jettisoned by South Korea if relations with the North improve during ongoing bilateral talks. In fact, the North Koreans have already baulked at the simple mention of negotiating away their nuclear weapons. Above all else, these talks, and a deal to curtail war games by both sides through March, buy Kim Jong Un and his regime precious time needed to perfect the country’s nuclear arsenal and long-range delivery systems. USAF Yet another major factor hangs over all these geopolitical moves, along with the B-2’s almost perfectly “on cue appearance” in Guam—that layer being the upcoming Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Everyone, including the U.S. and North Korea—the latter of which is now sending athletes as the result of bilateral talks—have an interest in seeing the event go smoothly as a flare up of tensions could spell disaster on a world stage, or worse. With this in mind, the B-2’s presence in the region would be an insurance policy of sorts against that happening—that is if the jets stay that long. And as we learned following the last winter games in Sochi, Russia, big geopolitical and military moves could occur after the games come to a close on February 25th and the goodwill surrounding them quickly melts away. Finally, and maybe the most ominous of all these factors, is that the B-2s have to train on executing missions over North Korea if they are called upon to do so. Some of this can be done stateside, but the unique challenges of the region, and coordinating with the multi-national assets that would be involved in such an operation, need to drill with the B-2s and vice-versa. Most of all, there are now two squadrons of F-35s forward deployed to Japan—USAF F-35As from Hill AFB deployed to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa and USMC F-35Bs forward deployed to MCAS Iwakuni. USAF These other stealth assets would work very closely with the B-2 Spirits during the opening stages of an air war over North Korea. The F-35’s are uniquely suited for providing air cover against North Korea’s limited Air Force and to help take on the country’s air defense system on the fly, paving the way for the B-2s to make it to their targets as safely as possible. Training for this complex mission in-theatre will greatly enhance the chances of success during an actual mission over the country—one where the Kim’s ability to use nuclear weapons in anger could be at stake. As you can see, the B-2 has every reason to be in the region at this critical time, and its arrival is a possible indication of combat action to come, but at the same time it doesn’t mean for certain that war is imminent. It is even possible that the jets and their maintainers could return to Whiteman, Missouri in just a matter of a few days. We’ll keep a close eye on the deployment and keep you up to date as events unfold. Author’s note: Pacific Command reached out to us to clarify that the B-2 will not replace the B-1B in the continuous bomber presence mission in the the near term. They are there as part of Strategic Command’s bomber assurance and deterrence mission, which is separate. We still don’t have a timeline for how long they will remain in the region.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Rumors are swirling about the fate of a top-secret spacecraft, known as Zuma , which Northrop Grumman supposedly built for an unknown U.S. government agency and launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket on Jan. 7, 2018. There are a number of theories about what might have happened already circulating, but a fairly obvious one seems glaringly absent: that the satellite didn’t crash at all and that it’s working as planned. The facts as they are known are that on Jan. 7, 2018, the Falcon-9 carrying Zuma lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Space launch firm SpaceX live streamed the launch on its own website, but ended the feed early in the mission, before the separation of the second stage, due to the classified nature of the payload. The U.S. government logged the spacecraft into its catalogue of objects in outer space as USA 280, but the entry on Space-Track.org otherwise contains no details about its orbit or reentry date. But within 24-hours, rumors and reports began to emerge suggesting that an accident had occurred and that the spacecraft was a total loss, all citing anonymous sources , with some saying that it had come down in the Indian Ocean. Satellite watchers have so far not been able to spot Zuma in orbit, but there are also no reports of witnesses on the ground or at sea seeing an object falling into the Indian Ocean. Individuals in Sudan and flying over that country did observe what appeared to be the normal venting of excess fuel from the Falcon-9’s second stage. SpaceX has flat-out denied that there was an issue with the Falcon-9 during the mission, but did not say anything about the Northrop Grumman-designed adapter that held Zuma in place inside the rocket’s payload fairing and would release it into orbit at the end of its launch sequence. Usually SpaceX provides this system along with the rocket, but Zuma is somewhat unique in that it used this critical component sourced from the payload’s owner—Northrop Grumman. SpaceX has similarly refused to confirm or deny anything about the status of the spacecraft due to the secrecy surrounding the project. “After review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night,” SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement to various news outlets by Email on Jan. 9, 2018. “If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible.” Northrop Grumman has said it cannot comment on the program because it is classified. The Pentagon responded to questions from various outlets saying, as a rule, that it does not comment on classified programs and could not directly address the Zuma issue. The National Reconnaissance Office has already gone on record saying that it is not the owner of the spacecraft. At present, there are three main competing theories as to what might have happened to the payload. There may have been a problem with the payload fairing, the payload adapter might have been unsuccessful in inserting Zuma into orbit, or the spacecraft might have failed to deploy properly after the payload adapter successfully released it. SpaceX was originally supposed to launch Zuma in November 2017. The company delayed the launch date to review concerns about the rocket’s payload fairing following the launch of another Falcon-9 on a separate mission, but did not elaborate on the issue. It is possible that whatever steps engineers took to mitigate the problem were not sufficient to prevent an accident. The next possibility, that the Northrop Grumman provided payload adapter did not function properly, would have left Zuma stuck on the rocket’s upper stage, which then fell back to earth, burning up in the atmosphere. Some have suggested that SpaceX specifically focused its statement on the rocket successfully completing its portion of the mission, leaving out any discussion of the adapter, in order to obscure what might have happened to the spacecraft. The last scenario involves Zuma detaching from the Falcon-9 successfully, but malfunctioning and not entering a proper orbit. Again, the theory goes that the spacecraft at least partially burned up as it fell back to earth, some sources say remnants of the craft impacted the Indian Ocean. This would explain why it has not been visible in space, active or otherwise. If it existed in orbit, even briefly, that could have been enough to warrant the entry into the U.S. government’s catalogue of space objects. Beyond SpaceX’s statement, though, all of the parties involved have continued to be tight-lipped about the launch. And we still don’t even know which arm of the U.S. government agency owns Zuma. “I would have to refer you to SpaceX, who conducted the launch,” Dana White, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson told reporters on Jan. 11, 2018, repeating the non-comment multiple times. Referring to the “the classified nature of all of this,” she said she would have “come back to you on that” with regards to whether there was an investigation into any possible mishap. Zuma heading up atop a Falcon 9. , SpaceX This is a particularly obtuse response to reasonable questions about what could be a multi-billion dollar accident, which could have serious ramifications, especially for SpaceX and its other U.S. government contracts. But the phrasing could also imply that Zuma’s owner exists outside of the Pentagon. The U.S. military might not be able to comment on the situation, not because it doesn’t want to, but because it isn’t authorized to do so by whoever actually owns Zuma. It is typical U.S. government practice for one agency not to comment on another agency’s programs, classified or otherwise. In addition, since it appears the matter of Zuma’s ownership is itself classified, the Pentagon would not be able to point reporters to the appropriate agency, because that would be disclosing classified information. If they cannot even identify the agency behind the project, which could be the Central Intelligence Agency, they would have little recourse but to point queries back to SpaceX or Northrop Grumman. Another possible issue is that Northrop Grumman could itself be the main sponsor of the project, performing a technology demonstration or risk reduction effort as part of a public-private partnership with a U.S. government agency. As such, again, the Pentagon might again not be able to speak directly to the fate of the spacecraft per the terms of that agreement or simply because the contractor owns the spacecraft and intended to operate it on behalf of a government entity. Why the Pentagon chose to single out SpaceX in this case rather than suggest journalists contact it and Northrop Grumman is less clear, though. Whatever the case, the Pentagon’s response has only muddied the waters regarding who is responsible for the spacecraft and its activities. And this might point to a very different theory. There is a possibility that Zuma is actually working properly, but is otherwise masked from observers on the ground and their commercially available tracking capabilities. That’s right, it’s possible that Zuma’s launch went exactly as planned, and that a new form of largely untrackable spacecraft has been put into orbit. This may sound far-fetched but it is anything but, especially when you take into account historical precedent. SpaceX The problem is in this day and age how do you get a very secretive, experimental stealth satellite into orbit without it being immediately tracked? There is no equally stealthy way of undertaking such an operation, at least not yet . As such, a cover story is needed so that the payload can begin its clandestine life in orbit without anyone having to admit that it’s up there at all. The idea of stealth satellites is far from new. Concepts for producing hard to detect orbital spacecraft—on radar or via optical devices—date back to the 1960s, and we know that the federal government spent close to $10B on a pair of stealth imaging satellites that were launched in the 1990s. FAS.org has put together a compelling package of information about stealth satellite programs spanning decades that you can access here . These highly classified orbital platforms, code named “MISTY,” were launched in 1990 and 1999, and could hide from radar and visual detection. In doing so they would presumably be able to make unpredictable photo runs over enemy positions and infrastructure and would be more survivable against ever-more capable anti-satellite weaponry. Standard satellites are easily trackable and follow along predictable orbits, with limited fuel onboard to change their orbital paths over their intended lifespan. As such, friend and enemy alike know when they will be overhead and adjust their operations accordingly. With this in mind, deploying satellites that don’t suffer from these limitations would be highly advantageous. A number of concepts exist that would provide stealthy capabilities to orbital platforms. One of which includes cladding the craft with an array of dark and radar-absorbent faceted surfaces, which would act in a similar fashion as those used by early stealth aircraft. Others concepts include leveraging mesh screens that could baffle radar returns, and maybe most promising of all, the use of large inflatable structures that can hide a satellite from orbit until it needs to photograph something, after which it can go back to hiding behind its radar and visual barrier of sorts. Both Teledyne and Bigelow Aerospace have patented various forms of this technology. Bigelow in particular seems especially suited for maturing this technology today as they have spent many years focusing on perfecting inflatable orbital structures . One is even deployed aboard the International Space Station. A inflatable stealth satellite patent belonging to Teledyne from the 1990s. , USPO We know that Zuma is some sort of very classified orbital spacecraft, and Northrop Grumman is one of the world’s top low-observable aerospace design firms. So it is very plausible that this craft is a new type of hard to detect, stealthy orbital system. Additionally, it may not be a reconnaissance satellite in the sense either, instead acting more like an adaptable vehicle that can execute dynamic maneuvers in orbit. Now we get back to how one gets a nearly untraceable satellite into a defined orbit without giving away the fact that it indeed is nearly untraceable. Probably the best way of doing so would be to muddy the waters as to the payload’s fate following launch, while at the same time not officially lying to the public as to its actual status. SpaceX says their rocket worked as advertised, and the federal government and the manufacturer won’t say anything else officially as to the condition of the payload, even though they could easily say that it failed to enter orbit without giving up any sort of information about its design, intended use, or even its intended orbit. But if Zuma actually made it to orbit, claiming officially that it didn’t would be a large-scale lie, and why go down that road when you don’t have to say anything officially at all? In fact, if this was a highly sensitive payload that could not be easily tracked, even deploying a series of decoys via Northrop Grumman’s unique payload adapter would make a lot of sense. Those decoys would de-orbit as if the payload had re-entered the earth’s atmosphere. Sounds nuts? Grabbing for your tinfoil hat? Don’t put it on just yet because the fact is similar observations and a lot of similar confusion occurred following MISTY’s launch as well. Space.com wrote the following in 2005: “The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) initiated a number of stealth satellite programs during the 1980s. The NRO manages the nation’s spy satellite programs. The most notable of these was dubbed MISTY, a non-acronym but apparently a photo-reconnaissance satellite for snapping pictures. “It was designed to be invisible to radar and optical tracking from the ground, but its photos were not as good as the big, non-stealthy reconnaissance satellites, like the Keyhole 11 and its successors. MISTY was launched from the space shuttle in 1990 in an unconventional way…it was rolled out over the side,” the source recounted. Another stealthy satellite was launched in 1999 atop a Titan 4 rocket launched from California. Once again the amateur satellite trackers followed it, although after awhile they began to suspect that they were actually following a decoy and that the satellite itself was in a different orbit.” The highly classified MISTY satellite was launched on February 28th, 1990 via Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-36. The mission was originally planned to launch from the USAF’s own Space Shuttle facility, known as SLC-6, at Vandenberg AFB in the late 1980s, but the Pentagon abandoned their own parallel Shuttle program and launch facility following the Challenger disaster. You can read all about SLC-6 and the military’s intent to put their own Space Shuttle to work in this past special feature of mine. , NASA C4ISR wrote in 2007 : “Misty 1 appeared to be a closed book until November 1990, when hobbyists in Scotland and France observed an unknown satellite in a similar inclination as Misty 1 but at a much higher altitude. Molczan’s computations showed that there was a good chance the mystery vehicle was Misty 1, meaning the orbital debris the Russians had tracked may have been decoys or debris purposefully generated to hide the intentions of the true satellite. About a week after news articles announced what the hobbyists had seen, Misty 1 disappeared again, Molczan said. As with Misty 1, shortly after Misty 2’s launch, nine pieces of debris were catalogued by the Air Force at or above the satellite’s initial orbit, Molczan said. Hobbyists tracked various objects, some for several years, but doubted that the primary satellite was among them. “No one has seen what might be the Misty 2 payload,” Molczan said.” During the deployment of MISTY in 1990, there were also major claims that the satellite broke apart and that the Shuttle mission was a failure . In retrospect, it appears that some sort of decoys were released to confuse Russia space object trackers into thinking that it broke apart just prior to the satellite disappearing under some sort of cloak. Not only do these historical accounts offer glimpses of potentially similar tactics, but fast forward to 2018 and imaging technology has made quantum leaps since the MISTY satellites were inserted into orbit. A modern stealth satellite likely wouldn’t be handicapped in imaging quality compared to its readily trackable cousins, and it could be smaller, allowing for greater capacity for stealthy technologies and maneuvering capabilities. In other words, the era of the stealth satellite may have finally arrived, one where very few if any tradeoffs between low observability and operational capabilities exist. If this is indeed the case, it couldn’t be any more timely. By every account, space is a future battlefield. Anti-satellite technologies once only dreamed of are now possible, and America’s potential foes are actively developing and even deploying these systems. Considering that America realizes many strategic advantages via its high-reliance on space-based capabilities, any major rival, and even smaller ones , would take aim at those capabilities during the opening shots of a conflict. In essence, with every day that passes the Pentagon’s traditional space-based platforms are increasingly vulnerable to attack, with low earth orbit becoming an especially impermissible environment. You can read all about this dangerous new era of space warfare here . Left photo is a long exposure showing the Falcon 9 first stage return for a vertical landing. The right photo shows the launch and the landing in one long exposure. , SpaceX Suffice it to say, working to develop a platform that can’t be easily tracked by enemy sensors would be a top priority of the Pentagon at this time. And this doesn’t just relate to imaging platforms that benefit from the element of surprise, but other types of satellites as well. Even communications satellites that could “selectively” shroud their position when their services aren’t in use, making them far more survivable than their “sitting duck” counterparts, would be a highly attractive capability for the Pentagon to acquire. With all of this in mind, it’s really worth at least considering the possibility that Zuma actually did exactly what it was intended to do. With the help of just a sprinkling of non-official disinformation, it may have been able to start its mission under the best possible circumstances—disappearing into the darkness to go about its intended task from the shadows undetected.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2018",French Rafale Fighters Will Deploy Aboard An American Supercarrier This April,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A number of Marine Nationale Rafale-M multi-role fighter jets and E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft, along with 350 support personnel and aircrew, will deploy aboard the USS George H.W. Bush this Spring. Not only will the multi-national operation work to give Rafale-M aircrews much needed carrier qualifications—France’s only carrier has been undergoing a mid-life refit —but it also aims to expand the two countries’ abilities to operate fighter aircraft cooperatively from the sea for prolonged periods of time. Captain Jean-Emmanuel Roux de Luze, the French Naval Attaché to the U.S. Navy, recently told USNI News the following: “We want to demonstrate our ability to integrate with U.S. military services… We want to show we do maintenance, demonstrate we can load weapons.” Under the plan, French Rafale-Ms and E-2C Hawkeyes will fly to NAS Oceana in Virginia and train out of that location for a period of time. Then some of the aircraft, aircrews, and support personnel will fly out to the USS George H.W. Bush to operate as an integrated component of the carrier’s air wing. USN The U.S. and French are in a very exclusive club, they are the only two countries in the entire world that maintain an operational catapult assisted take-off and barrier arrested recovery (CATOBAR) fixed-wing aircraft carrier capability. For a long period of time this wasn’t the case, with a handful of other countries around the globe fielding these types of ships. They are the most capable type of aircraft carriers given the aircraft that were able to fly off their decks. Since the waning days of the Cold War this club has shrunken dramatically , leaving just France and the U.S. with such a capability. But that is about to change as India and China march toward a CATOBAR capability of their own. USN Both French and U.S. carrier aircraft utilize very similar primary support infrastructure—namely very similar catapult and arresting gear systems, as well as similar navigational aids, allowing each other’s aircraft to “cross-deck” during cooperation training evolutions. Cross-decking can be as limited of an activity as executing touch and goes on one another’s aircraft carriers, or it can include conducting full-on launch and recovery operations, but it doesn’t usually include operating aboard a foreign carrier for a prolonged period of time. Longer-term cross-decking used to be a more common occurrence decades ago. In particular, American carrier-borne Navy squadrons would occasionally spend time operating aboard Royal Navy CATOBAR configured carriers and vice-versa. This practice was largely curtailed once HMS Ark Royal , the last Royal Navy CATOBAR carrier, was retired in 1979. US Navy A-6 intruders and F-4 Phantoms aboard HMS Ark Royal , Public Domain But this practice looks to be on the verge of a renaissance of sorts, and not just because Rafales are deploying to the USS George H.W. Bush . The USMC F-35Bs will be among the first aircraft to deploy operationally aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth. The Royal Navy even built a special USMC space within the ship in anticipation of near constant cooperative USMC-Royal Navy F-35B deployments. Considering that multiple other allied Naval arms are now interested in making their helicopter carriers F-35B capable, and procuring small lots of the jets themselves, this practice could become far more widespread. USN It remains unclear if a future multi-national carrier cruise between the Marine Nationale and the U.S. Navy at the squadron level will ever occur, but after this exercise it may be far more plausible than any time in the past few decades. Even a small deployment of say six French Rafales-Ms and a Hawkeye could be integrated into an existing air wing for an upcoming operational cruise, and there is plenty of room on American supercarriers’ decks these days to accommodate a foreign aircraft contingent. During the Cold War, Nimitz class supercarriers would carry upwards of 90 aircraft, today they commonly deploy with around 65, and many of those aircraft derivatives of the Super Hornet. USN The Rafale-M is no slouch when it comes to a modern air combat environment, it is a proven and highly capable tactical jet that can execute a wide variety of missions. Since the Super Etendard was retired , the Marine Nationale has focused all its energy on Rafale operations, making the force even more potent than it was before. With this in mind, bringing that capability, as well as the unique perspective of a foreign naval aviation force, aboard an American supercarrier for an entire cruise could be highly beneficial. Conversely, deploying Hornet or Super Hornets, and Hawkeye aircraft aboard the Charles De Gaulle once it comes out of refit could be equally if not more beneficial to the French. Regardless of where this high-profile exercise in international naval aviation corporation leads, we are sure to be bombarded with some amazing photos and video from the George H.W. Bush this Spring, and we who can argue with that?

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Hawaii Scare Was Bad But Be Prepared For More False Alerts Stating You’re About To Die,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As I am sure you have noticed by now, on Saturday, January 13th, 2017 Hawaii fell victim to a false alert of an incoming ballistic missile attack—you may even have found out about it from a push notification from a news site on your smart phone. Roughly 40 excruciating minutes passed between the horrifying blanket dispatch and one that rescinded it. In that time, an entire state sat comprehending their potential doom, waiting for the nuclear fire to arrive, and contemplating the reality of their own vulnerability. What followed was absolute outrage over the incident and an avalanche of questions as to how this could have happened. It turns out it was caused by a simple shift change mistake at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, but the cold hard truth is that it isn’t likely to be the last time something like this happens. In fact, it is probably only the beginning of a new age of such occurrences, and they won’t necessarily come from our own government. The emergency alert cascaded across Hawaii in an instant, and couldn’t have been more on cue. The standoff between the U.S. and North Korea over the rogue state’s nuclear and missile programs has reached a crescendo in recent months, and Pyongyang has proven that Hawaii is well within its reach if it decides to strike. Just six weeks ago, Hawaii tested its air raid sirens to warn of such attack for the first time in decades —the exercise acting as a harsh reminder of a new threatening and uncertain age. Meanwhile, there has been great buzz around the CDC’s upcoming public brief on what to do during a nuclear attack—another sign of changing times—and relations with Russia, a country with thousands of nuclear weapons still in its inventory, continues to erode. It’s also worth noting that nowhere in the United States is the attack on Pearl Harbor less forgotten, and the idea that another surprise strike could occur, but this time by via a single or handful of ballistic missiles able to inflict the incredible destruction of nuclear blasts, is palpable. Staffers watch for disaster alerts in the command center of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency in Honolulu., AP Making things worse is that the Emergency Broadcasting System of yesteryear has given way to progressively more invasive emergency alert systems. Before the advent of the smartphone, one had to be actually engaged with broadcast media in order to be impacted by an alert. Nowadays these messages are pushed in an instant to our phones, which have become an extension of our anatomy, rarely within an arm’s reach away. The widespread impact of such an alert messaging system is instantaneous, and because of the limited capabilities of the system as it sits today, it is also incredibly blunt. In 2013 the Wireless Emergency Alert System (WEAS) was introduced, and by its very design it is incredibly rigid. The absolute best summation of WEAS and how it came to be was posted today by the Atlantic , I would highly suggest you give it a read, but basically this system relies of carefully worded, pre-formatted , and pre-approved messages that are 90 characters or less and have to be generated by specific equipment and software. So we are talking about getting across the basic nature of an emergency event quickly, not giving meaningful instructions on how to react to that event or anything in addition. Those who preside over this clunky system can’t just type in a new message on the fly, like “false alarm, there is no ballistic missile this way, that message was an internal error,” the best they can do is stop the process of sending out more messages once it has begun. We got an idea of just how slow the process of generating a retraction is in this case, and that was under nominal conditions. The fact that social media, which acts at lightning speed, exists among such a slow moving public messaging system only made things worse. This seemed to be a normal exchange during the event: The fallout from the mistake has been severe, and rightfully so. For the average person living on the mainland who has never experienced something like this, it is simply hard to relate to the terror stirred-up by such an event. Governor David Ige stated the following: “What happened today was totally unacceptable… Many in our community were deeply affected by this. I am sorry for that pain and confusion that anyone might have experienced.” Shockwaves from this huge mistake are likely to ripple outward for months, but for now it serves as a stark reminder that false information and its relation to our smartphones doesn’t just stop at “fake news” on Facebook. America’s enemies understand this very well and are very likely to take advantages in weaknesses in America’s mobile networks to inject fear, mistrust, and confusion into the populace in the future. These are the lynchpins of Russia’s “hybrid warfare” playbook and their campaign to affect America’s political process during the 2016 election also sticks to these underlying tenets. Smartphones in particular are a ripe target for foreign actors, and especially Russia. Vern Miyagi, Administrator, HEMA, left, and Hawaii Gov. David Ige addressed the media Saturday, Jan. 13, 2018, during a press conference at the Hawaii Emergency Management Center at Diamond Head Saturday following the false alarm issued of a missile launch on Hawaii., AP American troops operating in Eastern Europe during recent military exercises had their smartphones repeatedly broken into and jammed with all sorts outcomes being witnessed. Other allied troops had constant messages sent to their phones. The War Zone reported recently : These reports match up almost word for word with information the Asymmetric Warfare Group collected regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The unit explained in its December 2016 handbook on Russian New Generation Warfare that the hybrid strategy had effectively blended electronic and cyber warfare with psychological operations to disrupt Ukrainian military activities. “Electronic warfare devices allow Russian Forces to broadcast … messages directly against opposing Ukrainian forces as discussed earlier with cellular text messages,” the manual explained. “These can be very specific and directed at individuals, such as by threatening their wives and children by name, or generic and sent to entire units as was the case in Ukraine.” Kremlin-backed forces in Ukraine even coupled these unconventional assaults with conventional military operations. The Asymmetric Warfare Group described one instance where separatists, undoubtedly with Russian support, zeroed in on a Ukrainian position possibly by pinpointing its radio transmissions , hit it with artillery, then sent texts asking to their opponents “asking how they liked” the barrage. Off the battlefield, armed with information scraped from phones and social media, Russia could make things especially personal, sending Ukrainian soldiers “text messages on their phone with threats against their families and accurate information of family locations,” according to the handbook. “Tactics such as this can have a tremendously negative psychological impact on young soldiers that are out of direct contact with their loved ones.” The Asymmetric Warfare Group warned in the handbook that the potential for these problem was only likely to increase given that the incoming generation of American military personnel were “truly ‘digital natives’” who have spent their entire lives interaction with the internet and social media. The U.S. military would have to learn to balance this reality with the obvious need for operational security. “Digital operational security violations now have strategic-level implications,” the unit’s handbook noted. “Never before has the actions of one lone individual been so visible and prone to manipulation by the adversary.” The blending of electronic warfare and psychological warfare operations is clearly on the rise, and we are made vulnerable to it via our own reliance and misplaced confidence in the technology we rely on a daily basis—namely our smartphones and social media. And it’s not just our devices that are vulnerable to cyber attack, the networks they operate on are also at risk. Making things worse, the public is woefully uneducated on the nature of the various federal alert systems or even how to discern the difference between an official message and a fake. Simply sending an official looking text to hundreds of thousands of people warning of an impending attack or disaster would likely have a similar effect as sending out an official message. US soldier taking a selfie with Polish troops. , US Army With this in mind, it’s only a matter of time until these vulnerabilities are exploited in a grandiose fashion, and this is only more likely to happen as tensions with potential foes around the globe ratchet up. It’s also worth noting that these manipulations can also emanate from non-state actors and extremist groups. By their very nature they represent an asymmetric and low-cost way for an enemy to spread fear. Some would even argue that such a capability represents a near ideal terror weapon of the future—one where plausible deniability is far more obtainable than with a kinetic attack, and because nobody actually dies, a major response is unlikely. In other words, such an action is more likely to prompt a law-enforcement action than a traditional military one. What’s most concerning is that there have been countless examples in recent years of emergency broadcasting systems being hijacked or hacked by entities with nowhere near the power or the sophistication of a peer-state opponent or even a major international non-state actor. Many vectors exist for these attacks, and thankfully they have mainly been pranks, such as alerting certain regions to a potential zombie virus outbreak or the end of the world . Even setting off air raid sirens for hours at a time in a major metropolitan area has occurred. But the risk of far more harmful operations executed by international actors remains. As we discussed in-depth over a year ago, voting days in American in particular are likely to be targeted for cyber attacks in the future. Sewing confusion and distrust, or capturing as many people’s eyeballs on a day when everyone is already engaged with the media wouldn’t be the only objective of such an operation. It isn’t hard to imagine a capable and highly nefarious actor sending out a bogus emergency alerts to key counties on voting day in an attempt to sway an election. The events over the last 36 hours in Hawaii have also spurred a lot of talk about past false alarms of impending nuclear attack. These have occurred on a military command and control level, and were horrifyingly prevalent during the Cold War, especially as computer technology was in its infancy and more was being demanded of it to support early warning systems than it was ready to provide. I highly recommend that your read Garrett Graff’s outstanding book Raven Rock , which gives the complete story of America’s emergency alert, early warning, command and control, and continuity of government systems. It also details some of the most egregious early warning errors that almost brought on doomsday without real cause. Fast forward to today and computer and remote sensing technology is far more up to the task of providing more reliable early warning capabilities. But even this seems to be on the cusp of changing as well. The officially proposed changes to America’s nuclear posture is a sign of a more dangerous world to come—one in which the average person will be far more susceptible to believing that a nuclear attack of some sort is possible or even underway at any given moment. Traditional forms of nuclear attack—submarine-launched and ground-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers carrying cruise missiles or bombs—are what America’s early warning systems have been designed to detect in the post Cold War era. But new methods of nuclear weapons delivery stand to overcome established methods of detection, not to mention existing missile defense systems , and America’s potential enemies are well on their way to fielding these capabilities. Traditional early warning systems, like the Ballistic Missile Early Warning Systems (BMEWS), and other large phased array radar systems scattered around the western hemisphere, aren’t capable of detecting some emerging nuclear threats. , USAF These including hypersonic weapons of various types , which can fly at very high-speed within earth’s atmosphere, and even maneuver dramatically on their way towards their targets. The reintroduction of road-mobile nuclear land attack cruise missiles is another major issue to contend with as they exhibit very little infrared plume during their boost phase, before continuing onto their target at low altitude. Even far more exotic weapons, like Russia’s supposed “Kanyon” ultra long-range nuclear armed torpedo, which is a real thing based on the Pentagon’s own analysis, shatters America’s traditional strategic early warning systems mold. As these weapon systems mature and become better known, they too will have a chilling effect on people’s confidence in the emergency broadcast system’s ability to reliably inform them of an incoming attack. And that’s really what’s at stake here—the public’s trust in their government’s ability to accurately communicate with them when it matters most. Considering these systems are how the President is suppose to address the nation during a major emergency situation (not just video or audio, but even using texts! ), if the zombie alerts or false missile attacks can pop up at any given time, what’s to say that what they are even hearing from President is real? And this is why undermining American’s emergency broadcasting capabilities will be an increasingly attractive target to enemy states and actors—by breaking the public’s faith in this most basic form of communication, it helps erode their greater confidence in their government as a whole. It’s sad to say but times are changing in many negative ways. The technology we rely so heavily upon is rife with vulnerabilities and its exploitation will become a growing feature of everyday life. When also considering the changing global strategic equation, it’s probably time the federal government start fresh with a new emergency alert system that takes social media and the fact that time and space has been “shrunk” by instant communication to virtually anywhere in the world on a individual level into account. And above all else, the system needs to be flexible enough to rapidly respond to changing situations, while also being firewalled from external tampering—especially the type that a teenage hacker can do from their parent’s basement. With all this in mind, maybe bringing in the best brains in social media product development together to find better solutions to this problem than what would come out of the clumsy federal government coming up with something on their own that is likely to be immediately obsolete, hard to evolve, and hugely expensive. If anything else, what happened in Hawaii this weekend should serve as a dire warning that our government’s ability to quickly communicate with the populace during a major crisis is woefully inadequate, and that needs to change, especially because the people’s trust in what they are being told will become increasingly at stake.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 28, 2018",Watch This MH-60S Shear Off Its Tailwheel While Taxiing At NYC’s Wall Street Heliport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s not exactly clear when the video was shot, although considering the snow in the background it was likely quite recently, but it depicts a US Navy MH-60S from HSC-9 “Tridents” taxiing after landing at the Wall Street Heliport in downtown Manhattan. As the helicopter moves toward the terminal it makes a tight right turn near the corner-edge of the operating area, with the helicopter’s tailwheel impacting the perimeter barrier and shearing off. Thankfully, the Navy chopper plopped right down on its tail-boom and nobody was hurt with the helicopter remaining totally intact—minus its tailwheel. The MH-60S, sometimes referred to as the Knighthawk, is a multi-role naval variant of the H-60/S-70 Black Hawk family of helicopters that carries out a variety of roles largely centered around the utility mission-set. These include vertical replenishment, general logistics, search and rescue/combat search and rescue, special warfare support, and anti-surface warfare among other duties. It differs from its MH-60R stablemate somewhat dramatically as the “Romeo” is far more missionized and elaborately outfitted for its anti-submarine warfare mission set and the basic airframe differs physically in some small ways as well. One of the most visible among them is the fact that MH-60S has a tailwheel—similar to the traditional UH-60 Black Hawk configuration—while the MH-60R , like its SH-60B forbearer, has a forward-mounted (by about a dozen feet), shock absorbing, twin wheel, rear landing gear setup. This configurations offers better deck-handling and more margin for error when landing on tight pads aboard surface combatants. In this case an MH-60R would have made that turn fine. The Wall Street Heliport gets quite a few high-profile guests , including frequent visits from HMX-1’s VH-3D and VH-60N “White-top” helicopters, and MV-22 aircraft when the President is in town. Other distinguished guests and business power players use the pad regularly due to its close proximity to the U.N. headquarters and the center of America’s financial industry, along with various other forms of traffic including a lot of sight seeing helicopter operations. Manhattan’s heliports are bustling places, especially since helicopter landings on helipads atop high-rises were banned following 9/11. Now just three helipads located along Hudson River directly serve Manhattan. As for the MH-60S crew, it’s pretty safe to say that they probably wish they landed somewhere else on what ended up being a very rough day for them indeed. Update: This is a take from an experienced Army Black Hawk pilot who watched the video: “That stuff happens but one thing I noticed is the crew chiefs, whose job it is to “clear” the aircraft left, right, up and down were not at the door gun stations (those windows are closed) but sitting Hollywood style on the cabin floor. It looks cool and feels cool to dangle your legs like you’re in Zero Dark Thirty but you can’t lean out far enough to clear the tail sitting there. Not to mention that rate of turn looks about twice as fast as normal. That was a simple turn that would have been prevented if the crew chiefs were just doing business as usual and not caught up in the fact that they were at arguably one of the coolest landing pads in the US.” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone was the first to report yesterday that two B-52s were en route to Guam, and once there they would join examples of the USAF’s other two heavy bomber types that have also taken up station on the island. A cadre of B-1Bs have been forward deployed to Guam for nearly a year and a half as part of Pacific Command’s continuous bomber presence mission, while a trio of B-2A Spirit stealth bombers arrived on there just last week to fulfill the U.S. Strategic Command’s more flexible and temporary bomber assurance and deterrence mission. Now those B-52s have arrived at Andersen AFB and Pacific Command has stated that four more B-52Hs will soon join them. This is the first time all three bomber types have sat on the ground in Guam at the same time since a rare occurrence in August of 2016 . The six B-52s will be joined by a total of 300 airman from Barksdale AFB in Louisiana to support the half century old bombers while forward deployed to the Pacific for the foreseeable future. The B-52s are intended to relieve the B-1Bs that have taken on a starring role in the standoff with North Korea. The B-52s will begin to fulfill the continuous bomber presence mission towards the end of the month when their B-1Bs counterparts return to South Dakota. In the meantime, all three bomber types will likely fly training missions around the region, and they could even end up executing a big cooperative show of force near North Korean borders. USAF With the B-52 taking over the continuous bomber presence mission, the United States will have a persistently deployed nuclear capable combat aircraft in the Pacific theatre. Beyond its nuclear role, during the opening stages of an air war over North Korea the B-52 would be used to execute standoff cruise missiles strikes on North Korean targets, in particular on fixed air defense sites and non-fortified strategic targets. Those strategic targets could include facilities related to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, regime-related sites, and/or more traditional military installations. The “BUFFs” would also likely be used to launch throngs of air-launched decoys to support the very first strikes into North Korea by stealthy aircraft and cruise missiles. These Miniature Air-Launched Decoys (MALD) will work to confuse, jam, and stimulate the country’s air defense network, leaving it vulnerable to attack. As the airspace over and near North Korea becomes less contested in the hours and days following the opening blows of a conflict, the B-52H could put its new smart rotary bomb rack and networking capabilities to use, dropping dozens of guided munitions of various sizes and capabilities on targets during single sortie. In particular the bombers could inflict heavy damage on North Korean emplacements along the DMZ. USAF For more analysis on how America’s surge of heavy bombers to the Pacific region could impact the geopolitical situation in North Korea, the Olympics and other factors, read this recent piece. But in the meantime we’ll likely see some amazing photos and video out of Guam of the three bomber types operating together.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 16, 2018",B-52s Are Headed Toward Guam Where B-1Bs And B-2As Are Already Forward Deployed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At least two B-52H Stratofortress strategic bombers, callsign MYTEE 51, are making their way across the Pacific. If they continue past Hawaii, and by all indications they will, it is nearly a certainty that they will arrive at Andersen AFB in the coming hours. There they will join B-1Bs and B-2As already deployed to the island outpost. Such an event would be the first time since August of 2016 that all three types that make up the USAF’s bomber force will be present on the island at the same time. The B-2’s recent surprise arrival to the island as part of U.S. Strategic Command’s bomber assurance and deterrence mission brought a whole set of new war fighting capabilities to a region that has become increasingly tense in recent months—including the ability to deliver nuclear weapons via an aerial platform. This is a capability that the B-1Bs that have been on station in Guam for 16 months don’t have. The B-52Hs headed in the direction of the island now, like the B-2As, feature the ability to deliver nuclear weapons. If the B-52s do indeed make a visit to Guam, it is unclear how long they will stay there. Very quick turnaround of heavy bomber training missions to the island do happen sporadically, but it seems more likely that just like in August of 2016, the triad of bombers will intermix for some time and even possibly fly a limited number of training missions together. Over the majority of 2017, B-1Bs operating from Guam flew near constant and ever more elaborate “show of force” missions near North Korean borders as the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang devolved into an increasingly perilous situation. The U.S. has few non-invasive military deterrence tricks left to play, but one of them could be flying various mixed sorties of strategic bombers toward North Korean territory, or even bringing all three bomber types together in one massive and high-profile show of force mission. Although such an operation seems somewhat silly for its air show like quality, it is precisely the type of display the U.S. and its regional allies have decided to put on in the past. https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fuser-687623182%2Fjan-15-usaf-b-52hs-mytee51-flight-over-the-pacific As we described in detail before , all this is occurring as the Winter Olympics in South Korea rapidly approaches, which will be a time of highly elevated risk in an already high risk area of the world. It also comes as high-level talks between South Korea and their belligerent neighbors to the north are underway. UPDATE: The B-52s have arrived, much more on their mission in this new post.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s connection with Lakehurst, New Jersey dates back roughly a century. Today the sprawling 7,400 acre site is littered with various test facilities used to develop the latest in naval aviation infrastructure. Most notably it’s where the seagoing force perfects its catapult and arresting gear technology for its aircraft carriers. But nearly 100 years ago, Lakehurst was America’s epicenter of lighter-than-air transportation. Anchoring the base and its then high-tech mission was the absolutely massive Hangar 1, a structure that once housed the Hindenburg and stood vigil across a grass field during that famous airship’s notoriously catastrophic demise. Later Hangar 1 become the home of a little known replica of a U.S. Navy flattop named CALASSES—it remains the Navy’s largest training aid to this very day. NAES Lakehurst today, with Hangar 1 still looming over the the sprawling installation., USN The 1920s was truly the age of airships, and the Navy looked to further leverage the budding technology for coastal patrol and maritime scouting duties, with a special focus on anti-submarine warfare. By 1921 the service had established Lakehurst as its headquarters of lighter-than-air technology, and it would also eventually became a hub for its related form of international commercial transportation. Hopes were high that massive dirigibles could “shrink the globe” for civilians and the military alike, and give war planners an unprecedented new mode of long-range aerial support. Hangar 1 was built upon the Naval Air Station’s founding in 1921. Measuring 961 feet in length and 350 feet in width, with its roofline soaring to 200 feet, the steel, wood, and asbestos-concrete structure was designed to accommodate the largest of airships and had a helium processing and delivery system nearby to service its mammoth tenants. It was also built to accommodate hydrogen-filled zeppelins as well in as safe a manner as possible. Its floor was spark-proof, electrical systems and lighting were explosion proof, among other special treatments. Volatile hydrogen was brought in via railroad tanker cars if needed. Hangar 1’s counter-balanced doors weigh 2.7 million pounds each, of which there are four. A trolley track system ran through the hangar and out to circular mooring stations beyond to dramatically ease handling of huge airships that would call the hangar home—even if just temporarily. Shenandoah being constructed in and rolled out of Hangar 1., US Naval Historical Center The hangar housed many of the most known airships of the era, including the first American-built rigid airship, the Shenandoah. The Navy’s hulking Macon and Akron airships had also called the base home. In fact, every one of the Navy’s relatively tiny fleet of rigid airships was based in the hangar at some point in time. German Dirigible Graf Zeppelin (LZ-127) (at right) in the airship hangar at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey. Photo is dated 7 August 1929. Also in the hangar is USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), which had been built in Germany as Zeppelin airship LZ-126 as a WWI war reparation., US Naval Historical Center As airship testing continued throughout the 1920s, the concept of commercial air travel on airships picked up as well. Lakehurst became an international gateway for these flights. The Graf Zeppelin stopped at Lakehurst on its around the world tour in 1929, and others followed well into the 1930s, including visits by the Nazi’s Hindenburg , which only had 18 inches of clearance forward and aft when docked inside Hangar 1. The U.S. Coast Guard Douglas RD-4 Spica (s/n V125) escorts the German Zeppelin LZ 129 Hindenburg on arrival at Lakehurst, New Jersey (USA), after its inaugural flight from Friedrichshafen, Germany, on the early morning of 9 May 1936. The decommissioned U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles (ZR-3) is visible in the background., USCG Hindenburg with no room to spare inside Hangar 1., Planet News Archive/SSPL/Getty Images The Navy’s success with these monster aircraft was far from stellar, with nearly all of the service’s dirigibles crashing over close to a decade and a half of operations. Then in 1937, the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg took the dream of widespread commercial air travel aboard dirigibles with it as it was consumed by flames within line-of-sight of Hangar 1. By that time the Navy’s airship program had pretty much folded, but World War II would see an airship renaissance of sorts, although those craft would be smaller anti-submarine warfare blimps, not the hulking rigid airships of the past. Still, during the height of WWII, the Navy has some 130 of these craft in service, making NAS Lakehurst a bustling place. A crowded Hangar 1 seen during WWII., USN/Public Domain By the dawn of the jet age, Lakehurst was morphing from a lighter-than-air master base to one that had a wide array of uses, with testing and training become its primary missions. This included the establishment of the Naval Air Test Facility (NATF) that would evaluate aircraft carrier launch and recovery systems and other naval aviation support capabilities. This is the same high-profile mission the base primarily executes till this very day. In 1951 the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC), now called Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training (CNATT), was established at Lakehurst as well. The outfit would go on to train thousands of Boatswain’s Mates, Naval Security Guards, Marine Airfield Technicians, Aircrew Survival Equipment Men, and Aerographer’s Mates. In the 1960s a very unique training aid was developed and constructed to help in NATTC’s mission—a one third scale replica of an aircraft’s carrier’s deck. USN Lakehurst was especially well suited to receive such a giant training aid as it had one of the world’s largest hangars, Hangar 1, free to shield it from the elements. By 1962 the Navy had no lighter-than-air craft left for Hangar 1 to accommodate. In other words, there was no shortage on interior space at Lakehurst to field such a large and unique contraption. And its name, the Carrier Aircraft Launch and Support System/Equipment Simulator, better known as “CALASSES,” aptly describes its mission and its size. USN CALASSES is 390 feet long, with the flight-deck sitting elevated above the hangar’s floor. Underneath it are the same launch and recovery systems found on American supercarriers, including the guts of the ship’s arresting gear and catapults. Up top features everything you would find on a carrier’s deck, including an island control tower, emergency barrier rigging, arresting cables, catapult tracks, Fresnel lens “meatball” visual landing aid, and so on—all the things that are needed to train Boatswain Mates before they head out to real McCoy. CALASSES is a far more forgiving and anemic environment for trainees to learn and make mistakes compared to an actual aircraft carrier deck which is one of the most dangerous places to work in the entire world. CALASSES seen in 1985 with aircraft on its deck., USN It’s not exactly clear when the practice ended, but for decades CALASSES operated with real airframes on its deck, along with the tractors and other equipment used to facilitate their movement and operation. The practice continued at least through the 1980s, but today no airframes are scurried around its flattop. Navy Lakehurst Historical Society The funny thing is that even such a massive installation looks small in Hangar 1, with the replica carrier situated in one of the hangar’s four corners. By some accounts, CALASSES came to be at least partially as an attempt to keep the Navy from demolishing the historic structure. The idea being if the Navy’s biggest training aid—a truly one of a kind and unmovable apparatus—was built inside of it, the hangar would probably survive as long as the training aid does. Regardless if this was actually part of CALASSES’s genesis or not, both it and the historic hangar it rests under exist in good condition today. https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpCbkAK7lQE With nearly a century of aviation history under its belt, Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst is truly a fascinating and supposedly even haunted place . The work done there over the years and today is so unique that there are seemingly unlimited stories wrapped in stories to tell. But Hangar 1 is truly the grand historical prize of the installation, and it’s only fitting that its massive facade cocoons another peculiar and massive piece of naval aviation history inside of it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 21, 2018",Are High-Powered Microwave Close-In Weapon Systems Destined For US Navy Ships?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Close-in defense is becoming a very hot topic in American defense circles and in those of foreign powers as well . America’s land fighting forces are rushing to address their glaring short-range air defense (SHORAD) gap , while the US Navy is coping with the reality that enemies large and small could successfully take a swipe at one of their surface combatants using everything from small boat attacks , to small drone swarms , to anti-ship missiles , and especially in tight littoral environments. Beyond the existing stalwart kinetic options , directed energy weapons have been seen as the holy grail of close-in naval defense, and it’s a space where the US Navy has spent significant development dollars in hopes of moving the technology forward. But lasers aren’t the only directed energy close-in weapon system (CIWS) solution—microwave systems may be an equally attractive and more attainable capability in the near term. The concept isn’t too tough to comprehend—a microwave array working like a traditional CIWS system, but instead of spewing cannon shells at its target or firing of a short-range and highly agile missile at it, it emits highly directional busts of high-power microwave energy that are capable of disrupting and even destroying electronics inside the offending enemy weapon system. In other words, it would leave boasts dead in the water and anything in the air—like helicopters, planes, missiles, and especially small drones—careening into Davy Jones’ locker or at least malfunctioning to the point that they aren’t a threat to the ship itself. This is exactly the type of device BAE Systems is pitching to the Navy, which they also showcased at this year’s Surface Navy Association’s symposium. The system leverages the proven Mk38 weapons mount already in use by the US Navy and other navies around the globe, but instead of a chain gun mounted on top it has an array of planar emitters. The Mk38 mount is in widespread use with the USN. Hundreds of 25mm chain guns use the base, which itself has become a core CIWS capability over the last decade and a half. BAE’s microwave system could be mounted on some of these existing mounts or on new ones altogether. , USN Below deck a microwave generator using high-speed switching feeds this array with an electromagnetic pulse in the microwave spectrum, and the turret is pointed at the target before the pulse is fired off just as a traditional CIWS system would do. The best part about it is that each shot costs a handful of dollars, not thousands or tens thousands or even hundreds of thousands dollars like other CIWS systems. It also has an unlimited magazine, at least physically speaking. Yet maybe the most attractive thing about a microwave CIWS solution is that using it doesn’t result in some sort of projectile, often times of the explosive kind, being shot through the air at high speed, making it far more usable even in very sensitive force protection scenarios, like when a ship is at anchor. Nor does such a system necessarily kill anyone inside a vehicle it is targeted against—making using the weapon against small boats a less than lethal and more attractive proposition. This could dramatically loosen up the rules of engagement in congested waterways, and thus provide a better chance of staving off a potential attack. BAE says they have successfully tested the capability against various targets, but they haven’t pushed it to a naval environment just yet (that’s what government contracts are for right?!). Range varies based on the target type, environment, and the configuration of the emitters, but the good thing is that unlike lasers, this system isn’t heavily impacted by environmental conditions such as rain, fog, and battlefield obscurants. The good people over at Navyrecognition.com put together this great little video of BAE System’s booth from the NSA 2018 symposium, the high powered microwave CIWS system is discussed at 1:45 into the video if it doesn’t advance automatically for you: Supposedly the system is also highly scalable so it can be adapted to different sized surface combatants, although there would likely be a tradeoff in range and strength based on how the mount is configured. One also has to wonder if this type of system could be mounted on commercial vessels as a less-than-lethal option for dealing with piracy. If this can zap a go-fast’s engine at a decent distance it could be a way for vulnerable merchant vessels to defend themselves without having to carry traditional weaponry. It’s hard to image that the US Navy, and other navies as well, wouldn’t be interested in this system. The fact that it could be installed on existing or additional Mk38 mounts makes it very attractive as its basic infrastructure is already a known commodity and in the inventory. Above all else it bridges the gap between the Navy’s potent electronic warfare suites deployed on its surface combatants and kinetic CIWS options, while also offering a less than lethal option for the increasingly troublesome issue of fending off potential small boat attacks. High-powered microwave weapons have a lot of promise, and potential peer-state competitors are actively pursuing the technology , but they remain in the shadowy fringes of military capabilities. Most recently there was big talk and a lot of confusion about the possibility of using the USAF’s still experimental microwave pulse equipped cruise missile against North Korea’s ballistic missiles, and there has long been talk about systems with similar capabilities as those described by BAE Systems being used on clandestine aerial platforms in war zones in the Middle East and Africa. Even powerful AESA radar sets that are becoming widespread on modern combat aircraft are known to have a secondary non-kinetic attack capability, where their high-power pencil-sized beams of electromagnetic energy could be used to fry enemy missile and air defense-related electronics. So clearly there is something to this technology, but we’ll have to see if the Navy will foot the bill to find out how to adapt it as a primary weapon system deployed in a harsh naval environment. But it is worth noting that the service has been willing to do so aggressively with similar weapons concepts in the recent past. We also really don’t know exactly how effective this can be over various ranges and against different targets, and how vulnerable hardened military platforms would be to such a system. But even if it is only effective against small boats and drones, and less rugged aircraft and some missiles, it would be a major breakthrough in CIWS capability. Regardless of the state and capabilities of BAE Systems’ particular concept, microwave CIWS capability represents an exciting proposition and it is probably just a matter of when, not if, such a system becomes a fixture on American fighting ships.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",This Ancient Suit Of Elephant Armor Holds The Record For The Largest Of Its Kind,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Cavalry is heavily celebrated and romanticized in western culture. From the knights of Europe, to the charging forces of 19th century America, to the war in Afghanistan , the fascination with the horse as a war animal continues to this day in popular culture. But farther to the east, the war elephant reigned supreme on the front lines in some of the greatest battles in ancient history. Something of the main battle tank of their day, these huge beasts were often sent charging towards the enemy’s lines, and unlike horses, spears and common blades had little impact on them when fighting at full tilt. To increase the survivability and improve the lethality of these creatures in combat, increasingly elaborate sets of armor were built for them, with the one above being the most extensive of its kind still surviving to this day. The armor is displayed on a life-size elephant model in the Oriental Gallery at the Royal Armouries National Museum of Arms and Armour in Leeds. This specific set of armor was brought to Britain by the wife of the second lord of Clive, who was the governor of Madras in 1801. It was originally displayed Powis Castle before it was transferred to London Tower in 1949 for conservation. It was acquired by the Royal Armouries in 1962 in lieu of death duties . Designed with charging in mind, the elephant’s head and much of its trunk is extensively covered by the metal armor. , Gilgamesh/wikicommons The highly embellished metal suit, which includes elaborate depictions of various animals, was designed for an adult Asiatic Elephant in the 16th century. It emanates from Northern India during the Mughal Empire, and is made up of 5,840 individual plates weighing some 260 pounds. Part of the suit is missing, but complete it is estimated that it would be made up of a total of 8,439 metal plates, and would weigh over 350 pounds. Regardless, even in its current form it is the Guinness World Record holder for the largest suit of animal armor. You can see the two missing panels from this angle, and how the elephant’s neck is fully covered. , Geni/Wikicommons What’s not displayed, but also part of this armor set, are a pair of long, crescent shaped tusk swords (also called elephant swords) that would have been mounted on a war elephant’s partially sawn-off tusks. During a charge they would have slashed and pierced their way through whatever they came in contact with. Some armies coated these attachments with poison, making them even more lethal and instilling greater fear among the opposing army’s ranks. Tusk swords were used for centuries but just a handful exist today. The left goes with the armor suit discussed above, the right is another example, likely from an earlier age. , Left: Royal Armouries. Right: TheMet The use of war elephants dates back millennia. Their use is mentioned as far back as the 4th century BC, likely originating in India. From there the use of elephants as weapons propagated through the centuries and eventually ranged as far west as the Mediterranean. The tactical employment of elephants on the battlefield played a major role in the conquests of Alexander the Great, who was so fearful of their impact in combat that he eventually commandeered some and employed them in his own ranks. Hundreds of years later, the Romans put war elephants to use en masse during their own campaigns, including the conquest of Greece. Even as the widespread use of elephants for warfare died off in Europe in the early middle ages, farther east they remained a staple in large standing armies. It wasn’t until the introduction of gunpowder that elephants finally began to fade from militaries in Asia, but this was a slow process. In fact, President Lincoln was offered elephants to use against the Confederates during the Civil War by the King of Siam, which was politely turned down . What seems to be the last major use of elephants on the front lines was in Vietnam in 1885 during the Sino-French War where they were used as mobile firing platforms more than anything else. But long before then, cannon fire made the lumbering beasts increasingly vulnerable during combat, which led to their tactical utility being questioned. As early as the 1500s, elephants began to disappear from major battles in south central Asia. Painting of an elephant in battle, made in Kota, Rajasthan, India circa 1750, Public Domain Traditionally speaking, the war elephant was used to charge enemy lines or to counter an impending enemy charge. They could crash through seemingly impenetrable walls of infantry, breaking a gaping hole in the enemy’s formation, with the elephant slashing with its augmented tusks, stampeding over soldiers, and giving archers a near ideal platform to pick off fighters below. Above all else, they were major psychological warfare elements that would instill terror and the feeling of dream and hopelessness in the enemy. Their thick hides and massive size made traditional edged weapons nearly useless against them. Their unfamiliar stench could send enemy cavalry running in fear as well. They could also work as mobile command and control platforms or even to dump soldiers right into an ongoing skirmish. War elephants, equipped according to General d’Orgoni’s instructions. , De Agostini Picture Library Countermeasures against elephants included targeting their tusks, as cutting them off could send them running mad. The use of special javelins, fire (including igniting screaming pigs covered in oil), and eventually specially built crossbow artillery that would send an iron bolt through their thick hide were also tactics employed over the centuries to stop elephant onslaughts. Still, many of these tactics were opportunistic in nature and adding armor to elephants could help harden them from some known vulnerabilities. A major factor that kept war elephants around so long is that they could be turned into beasts of burden when not in combat, helping to construct fortifications, bridges, and other installations, or transporting materiel over long distances. Still, they will be remembered most for their crushing impact on the battlefield. One can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for a soldier to face down such a huge and heavily armored animal on an ancient battlefield, many of which may not have ever seen an elephant before. Not to mention how terrifying the chaos of combat must have been for the elephants themselves, which are incredibly intelligent and social creatures.

Three separate angles show thick black smoke rising from a blaze burning among docked Kilo class diesel-electric attack submarines. Shortly after the videos appeared, Russian media said the fire was part of a “damage control exercise” according to the Russian Navy.

The thick black smoke and the way the surface of the water is burning as seen in the videos makes it look like a diesel fire. Maybe the blaze was touched off during fueling of one of the Kilo class submarines tied-up on the pier, or maybe there was a leak of some kind from the submarine’s tanks.

Namely the ship acquired the proprietary Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) system which will greatly enhance its capabilities, security, interoperability, and future adaptability. Overall the work will ensure that the ship remains viable for another two decades, by which time she will have been in active service for nearly 70 years. USN The Blue Ridge class, which is made up of two ships, USS Blue Ridge and USS Mount Whitney, are in some ways the most antiquated of US Navy ships, but in other ways they are the most advanced. As a platform they are based around 1960s technology, but the computer systems and communications links they carry are leading-edge. The ships were designed in the 1960s from the keel up to be command and control vessels with a heavily reliance on computer systems and high-end communications. Originally their mission was to command wide-scale amphibious operations, but over the years, as joint warfighting doctrine evolved, they became capable of much more than that and their importance has increased because of it. USN Today the ships are spread between the western and eastern hemispheres, where the Japan-based USS Blue Ridge acts as the flagship of the 7th Fleet and USS Mount Whitney, which is based in Gaeta, Italy, acts as the flagship for the 6th Fleet and as a command ship for the NATO alliance. The vessels are supposedly the most sophisticated Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) ships ever created, but the public really only sees their massive exteriors—measuring some 620 feet in length and displacing 18,400 tons—which are dotted with large satellite communications domes and antenna. USN The question of what’s inside these ships has actually come up in more than a dozen separate emails I have received over the years, so I thought it would be finally worth digging into photo archives to see if I could build some sort of overall picture of what the interior of these ships is like. Although images of the ships’ mission areas were very limited, what we found gave the depiction of a unique shipboard environment made up of multiple briefing and collaboration areas, as well as real-time situational awareness and command and control centers. One thing was common throughout all of these sections—there are lots and lots of computer terminals. This really isn’t surprising, but offers a little different atmosphere than the purpose-built proprietary consoles we are used to seeing in modern surface combatants’ glowing Combat Information Centers (CICs). USN Basically, these ships are something loosely akin to the Combined Air Operations Centers (CAOCs) that are used to integrate air wars, and the ground war below to some degree, over wide geographical areas. And like CAOCs, the Blue Ridge class has been adapted to fully support coalition operations, with representatives from countries involved being deployed aboard during those operations. But the big difference is that CAOCs are based on land, not on roving ships, and they aren’t optimized for fighting in maritime and amphibious environments. USN The vessels, which are based on the Iwo Jima class hullform and can keep up with an Amphibious Strike Group, are also comparatively spacious, and there are generous accommodations for flag officers and other higher-ups. According to this image the flag officer’s quarters even has a fireplace. But these are still fighting ships that would operate in the vicinity of a flotilla during combat, and are equipped with a pair of Phalanx close-in weapon systems, remote 25mm chain gun turrets, along with .50 caliber machine-gun stations for force protection. The ships also have decoy launchers and electronic warfare suites to help fend off anti-ship missile attacks. An MH-60S is usually deployed aboard as well for logistics and liaison duties, although there isn’t a hangar. The ship can store a whopping 123,000 gallons of aviation fuel. Other features include fin-stabilizers for a smooth ride, kevlar armor, and the ability to carry a handful of small landing craft and boats. USN But once again, these ships are giant floating warfighting brains of sorts, and their mission is to provide command and control and the best information possible to commanders who will have to make the hard calls as a battle unfolds. They can also redistribute key information they receive via their satellite communications systems to the fleet. Considering that their C4I systems are so powerful, and increasingly so, you can see how these vessels could potentially play a new high-stakes combat role via cyber warfare in the future. USN Commanders will have new weapons in their quiver to put to use during future conflicts, and it is very possible that they will be able to command the deployment of those weapons from these vessels, striking at the heart of the enemy’s own C4I capabilities using cyber warheads instead of explosive ones. With this in mind, these ships, and the networks they rely on, will also be increasingly targeted by the enemy using their own forms of electronic warfare and cyber attacks. This makes agile implementation of defensive countermeasures, or even kinetically killing the enemy’s ability to deploy such attacks before they can occur, absolutely key. It is fairly logical to think that these half century old vessels, and the commanders that sail on them, are adapting to this changing combat reality. USN We come back to the question of what does it look like inside an old ship that is capable of carrying out such a modern mission? Especially one that accommodates 250 officers and 1200 enlisted crew (but usually the ships sail with about half that complement for peacetime operations), and up to 3,000 people in an emergency. We’ve put together this tour of sorts of the Blue Ridge class, including pictures from both ships’ primary internal areas, to try an answer that question. Obviously there are areas in these ships that are classified, likely including the large server farms, intelligence exploitation areas, and other facilities that make them so capable. But still, what we could find is quite interesting. First off, we discovered a couple good quality video showing some areas inside the ship: The heart of the ship mission-wise is a command and control facility called the Joint Operations Center. It is here that much of the filtered and critical information collected by the ship’s C4I systems is displayed on large screens in a theater-type layout. This is likely where the flag officers would monitor major operations.

Replacing them would likely be a very expensive proposition, even if an existing class, like the San Antonio class , or the upcoming LX(R) amphibious assault ship could be adapted for the mission. It seems that the class was built extremely tough, but their boiler-powered steam turbine propulsion is a relic of the past, and this could limit their use past their current planned lifespan. In the meantime, during any major naval operation, yet alone a peer state conflict, rest assured that these ships will be standing off, acting as the neurological center of the fleet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Video Of A Russian Nuclear Icebreaker Blasting By Some Guys And Their Trucks Is Nuts,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Incredible video has emerged from Russia showing the massive Russia nuclear icebreaker Taymyr roaring past a group of adventurers and their Toyota trucks. The whole event looked as dangerous as it was thrilling for the off-roaders. The super-sized encounter occurred on the frozen Yenisei River, near the Kara Sea. Russian media outlet RT states : “Evgeny Shatalov, one of the drivers, said he managed to get close to the giant ship and touched it, posting his claim on Instagram. He also jokingly regretted that no one on the team touched the icebreaker with their tongue, as that would surely bring good luck to the whole endeavor. When the ship passed by, it was some -50 Celsius… The team is driving factory-stock Toyota pickup trucks to the far-north town of Dixon. The daring expedition started on January 15 from the city of Norilsk.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Anton Panov (@oper_11) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Anton Panov (@oper_11) The group is driving a squad of relatively unmodified Toyota pickups over long distances up in the northwestern reaches of Russia, much of which is frozen this time of year. It’s not clear if the Russian icebreaker even saw them as it approached, and considering how fast it was moving, things could have gone much worse. One of the world’s largest icebreakers till this day, Taymyr was built in Finland for Russia during the last years of the Cold War. It was commissioned into service in 1989, and measures 490 feet in length, 92 feet wide, and displaces 21,000 tons. A single KLT-40M nuclear reactor located in the center of the ship’s hull provides a thermal output of 171 megawatts to power the ship. Taymyr can operate in areas where there is more ice than draft—with as little a 30 feet of actual depth available—making it ideal for cutting paths through large rivers and littoral channels, or rescuing ship trapped in them. A crew of 115 operates the ship but it can accommodate up to roughly 140 on certain missions. Taymyr has a sister-ship in her class, Vaygach, which remains operational. Icebreaker Taymyr ., Tuomas Romu/wikicommons Taymyr was designed to be safer than her predecessors with various redundancies and safety features factored into its design, but even with these features there have been incidents of small-scale radiation leaks. In 2011 a coolant leak in the ship’s ventilation system caused a radiation release, resulting in the Taymyr returning to port for emergency repairs. The age of the nuclear reactor seems to also be a concern as its life has been extended to nearly double its original design parameters. Russia has said time and again that the ship will be retired in recent years only to keep it in service. Russia has a large fleet of icebreakers—roughly 40 in total and that number is growing—while the U.S. basically has one fully operational icebreaker and another that is about half operational at best. This reality has huge strategic implications because Russia is working on securing the arctic for itself , with energy reserves and emerging trade routes being major strategic prizes in the coming decades. The U.S. and its allies have slowly been working to up their frigid environment combat capability, but those moves are dwarfed by Russia’s own initiatives. Moscow has ordered an entirely separate warfighting fleet for arctic region, including armed icebreaking frigates , among other ships and weapon systems . They have setup bases throughout the region, some of them quite elaborate , and drill their militarily for arctic operations on a regular basis. They are even modifying a massive specialized submarine for arctic operations . But icebreakers, especially large nuclear powered behemoths like Taymyr shown in the video, will be key in leveraging the region’s possibilities to the max, and you can’t exactly procure these from any shipbuilder on short notice. The Coast Guard still hopes to build three new medium icebreakers by the early 2020s, and to possibly arm those vessels with cruise missiles in the future, but even though such a program is strategically imperative, it has proven to be troublesome to kickstart funding-wise. As of now the plan is for the U.S. Navy to fund the first ship, with the rest coming out of the USCG’s already relatively menial budget. But the idea is at least to get some sort of icebreaker into serial production so the line can be expanded in the future if need be. High demand for icebreakers has even struck the Navy this year on the Great Lakes, where its newest Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Little Rock , has been stuck in Montreal due to ice. As it sits right now, the ship won’t be able to leave that port till sometime in late March, significantly delaying its arrival at its future homeport in Mayport, Florida. Other areas in the U.S. are in dire need of icebreakers as well due to the extremely cold temperatures, with flooding becoming a major concern.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Mattis Got A Kick Out Of Indonesian Soldiers Drinking Snake Blood During Bizarre Display,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what was surely a “unique” departure ceremony for visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Indonesian Special Forces , known locally as the Kopassus, put on quite a display. During the over-the-top exhibition the fatigue-clad operators showed off some of their unique skills, including breaking concrete blocks with their heads and wrangling snakes, killing them, and drinking their blood. Clips of the intense spectacle started making the rounds on the social media last evening, resulting in an interesting mix of reactions. But for the guest of honor, the spectacle was all in good taste. While flying on aboard his E-4B aircraft to Vietnam, the next stop on his week-long Southeast Asia tour, Mattis told reporters : “The snakes! Did you see them tire them out and then grab them? The way they were whipping them around, a snake gets tired very quickly… You could imagine how much training went into each individual there, that they were able to do that… When you watch a force do that, many small things, perfectly, you can imagine that they can also put the bigger things together.” JANUARY 23: U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis (front) is welcomed by Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu (rear) during an official ceremony at Ministry of Defense Office in Jakarta, Indonesia on January 23, 2018. Mattis’ trip to Asia aims to improve cooperation in regional defense and security. , (Photo by Anton Raharjo/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Although many back in the USA will take issue with his enthusiasm for the display, the Indonesian military’s fascination with killing snakes and drinking their blood certainly isn’t new. For American forces that deploy for training with their Indonesian counterparts, namely the country’s hardened special operations forces , the act is a rite of passage of sorts. Also, snakes are extremely common in the jungles of Indonesia, many of which pack a venomous bite. So being able to deal with them isn’t just for show, there is a harsh reality to such training. But let’s be clear, snake handling and drinking fresh snake blood are two different concepts altogether. https://youtube.com/watch?v=y89ZJ5bTS6g Mattis himself is no neophyte when it comes to the somewhat barbaric customs of foreign cultures, having spent his life as a Marine deployed all around the globe in a combative role, and later on, in a partially diplomatic one as a general. With this in mind, the snake display in Jakarta was probably not all too surprising to him. Almost comically outrageous military spectacles are in no way proprietary to Indonesia. Many countries, from the poorest to the richest around the world, put on garish military reviews for various occasions. The traditional large-format military parade , used to show off a country’s overwhelming might and combat prowess, is most common, but more creative and lively demonstrations aren’t that rare either. Maybe the most outlandish example in recent memory was this one that took place last year in Saudi Arabia. President Trump has floated the idea multiple times of executing elaborate military displays in and over Washington DC, and even though many deride him for the idea there is a historic precedent for such a thing. Mattis’s trip to Jakarta and the emphasis on the country’s controversial but brutally effective special forces could result in deeper ties with American special operations units. Cross-training and direct support has been limited since 2010, and between 1999 and 2010 it was largely embargoed due to human rights abuses by Indonesia’s special forces in the 1990s. Indonesia’s defense minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said the following during Mattis’s visit: “For a while there have been sanctions against Kopassus … he (Mattis) will try to remove this… One of the sanctions is clearly that they are not allowed to go to America. They can’t do training together, and he will reopen this.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6x_7Byqqo James Mattis left on his week-long tour of Southeast Asia shortly after releasing America’s new military strategy last Friday, one that declared the days of focusing on counter-terrorism operations are over and a return of peer-state power competition is upon us. As such, the trip to the increasingly contested region will focus on building alliances to counter-balance China’s growing regional might and its claims on nearly the entirety of the strategic South China Sea. On his trip to Jakarta, Mattis told reporters : “What we’re looking for is a world where we solve problems and we don’t shred trust, we don’t militarize features in the middle of international waters, we don’t invade other countries—in Russia’s case… Small nations should get the same respect, the same regard, as larger nations. Every nation matters and there should not be any bullying or shredding of trust toward others… What we want out here [is] a peaceful, prosperous, and free Asia, with a free and open regional order defined by the rule of law.” I guess in the Secretary of Defense’s mind, if a little snake blood gets spilled in achieving those goals, so be it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",US Army Hits Setbacks Trying to Add New Infrared Countermeasures to Its Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has begun fitting new directional infrared countermeasures to its AH-64E Apaches , giving the gunships added protection against heat-seeking missiles. Now, a review of the effort from the Pentagon’s central testing office reveals those systems do not always work properly. In addition, plans to add the same capability to variants of the UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook have experienced significant setbacks, forcing engineers to reassess how they plan to install the equipment on those helicopters. The Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation disclosed these details in a review of testing work during the 2017 fiscal year on various weapon systems and other important equipment across the U.S. military, which it published earlier in 2018. This is the first time this routine report has included a section on the Army’s program to integrate the countermeasures, officially known as the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure, or LAIRCM, across its fleets of Apaches, Black Hawks, and Chinooks. Army aviators have experienced “multiple failures” with the countermeasure system’s warning sensors “in theater,” the report explained, without saying where those operations occurred specifically. “The Army halted integration on the HH/UH-60 variants and CH-47F platforms due to design flaws in the sensor placement and mount systems.” The full LAIRCM system, which Northrop Grumman makes , consists of six infrared warning sensors, a pair of turreted laser countermeasures called the Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly, and a control interface that links these components together and to the aircraft’s own mission systems. When it spots an incoming heat-seeking missile, it gives the pilots both audio and visual cues so that they can take evasive action and points the turret, which contains a laser, at the threat. The beam’s job is to blind and confuse the missile’s own heat-tracking sensor and cause it to fly off course. The system is limited to engaging one threat at a time, meaning it is most effective as part of a suite of defenses, which would also include other countermeasures, such as decoy flares. The components of the LAIRCM system the Army has been working to install on various helicopters., DOD In July 2017, the Army quietly announced that AH-64E Apaches with the 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment had become its first helicopters equipped with the LAIRCM to see actual combat. The unit having deployed to Northern Iraq to support the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS terrorists. The Aviationist further highlighted the service’s use of the countermeasures system in the region after additional photos of the squadron’s gunships with the new equipment emerged in October 2017. The Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies are clearly visible on the tips of the AH-64Es’ stub wings in these images. One of 4-6th Cavalry’s AH-64Es with the LAIRCM system., US Army Other versions of the system are already in service with the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Dutch Army has also employed an earlier generation of the countermeasures on its AH-64D Apaches for nearly a decade. The nomenclature for the various arrangements can be confusing, given that helicopters are hardly “large aircraft,” but the different versions share the same basic features as the original models the Air Force adopted. The Army’s variant is based on the so-called “Department of the Navy” (DON) AN/AAQ-24(V)25 configuration commonly found on Marine Corps’ CH-53E helicopters . An earlier model of Northrop Grumman’s directional infrared countermeasure system on a Dutch AH-64D Apache., Northrop Grumman The decision to equip helicopters involved in the fight against ISIS with extra defenses makes perfect sense. These weapons are relatively easy to use and can be dangerous to both civilian and military aircraft . ISIS reportedly put together a manual for its fighters on the best tactics for employing them against coalition planes and helicopters. Since 2012, Small Arms Survey has documented at least three different types of heat-seeking shoulder-fired, man-portable surface-to-air missiles, commonly known by the acronym MANPADS, in the hands of various terrorist and rebel groups in both Iraq and Syria. Other independent researchers have also been able to track the proliferation of these systems through propaganda photos and video and black market arms listings. A Marine Corps’ CH-53E with the LAIRCM system., USMC Militants say they have shot down a number of a number of Iraqi , Syrian , and Russian aircraft , though those parties often deny the claims. That being said, the Russians have steadily begun adding similar directional countermeasures, such as the President-S system , to their helicopters in Syria and are offering the equipment to countries with similar terrorist and insurgent threats . The danger of MANPADS exists well beyond Iraq and Syria. Houthi rebels in Yemen successfully brought down an American MQ-9 Reaper in October 2017, saying they did so with a shoulder-fired missile. The weapons have been a particularly important tool for Russian-backed separatists fighting the Ukrainian government, as well. But the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation says that the new defensive gear on the Army’s AH-64s in Iraq did not always work as intended on this initial deployment. Worryingly, the warning sensors have failed on multiple occasions, which could render the system ineffective depending on how the incoming missile approaches the helicopter. “Northrop Grumman identified the problem and the Army put a pilot procedural workaround in place,” the office’s report said. “The potential still exists for aircrew to fly with a failed sensor since system indication of sensor failures is visual only.” The Virginia-headquartered defense contractor found that the problem was in the software linking the sensors with the rest of the system. Unfortunately, the patch that was supposed to fix the issue also failed. Northrop Grumman was supposed to provide another update in October 2017. However, the reporting period for the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s review ended in September 2017 and we don’t know if this new code has arrived or if the system is now working as advertised. The video below shows a directional infrared countermeasure system deflecting a missile during a test. The Army’s developments of additional versions of the system that will work with its Black Hawks and Chinooks have run into more serious hurdles. In both cases, tests exposed problems that required engineers to completely rework how they intended to mount the various components on the helicopters. The mounts for the Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies on the UH-60L and M models physically broke during testing. In a combat situation, with the crew taking evasive maneuvers, one imagines that structural failure could lead to the turrets breaking away from the aircraft entirely, rendering the system useless. Flight testing of the LAIRCM on a CH-47F Chinook , which began in July 2017, revealed that the arrangement of the six warning sensors did not provide adequate coverage around the helicopter. As with the outright sensor failures in Iraq, if these components don’t detect the incoming missile, there’s no chance for the rest of the system to counter it. A US Army CH-47 Chinook flies ahead of a UH-60 Black Hawk during an exercise. The service plans to add the LAIRCM system to both types., US Army Of course, none of the issues indicate any fundamental problem with adding the LAIRCM to the Army’s helicopters. It is clearly a valuable capability to have as MANPADS continue to become a more common threat. These weapons are also steadily becoming more capable with their own means of defeating certain countermeasures, such as decoy flares, meaning that it is only more important for crews to have multiple layers of defense. Still, the delays in fielding the equipment, which as we already noted is in service with both the Air Force and Navy already, are significant, especially since the Army has been working on this since at least 2016. The service first began the program in response to an urgent request from special operators in the Middle East, which those units had submitted to their superiors in 2015. I previously obtained heavily redacted copies of those documents via the Freedom of Information Act, which you can find here and here . We don’t know if special operations helicopter units in the region, including elements of the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , have already begun using other versions of the LAIRCM. If they are, though, it’s not clear why the Army has run into problems with the physical arrangement in porting the system over to the Black Hawks and Chinooks. The 160th uses specially configured MH-60 Black Hawk and MH-47 aircraft . It’s also not clear how this has happened given the extensive knowledge base regarding the underlying system within the U.S. military. The Air Force has employed the original LAIRCM on a wide variety of aircraft, including its especially sensitive VC-25A “Air Force One” jets, for more than a decade. The Marine Corps has been flying a variety of helicopters, including its own highly modified VH-3D “Marine One” and VH-60N VIP types. A VH-60N with the LAIRCM system., AP One would imagine that the VH-60N would share at least some similarities with other H-60 variants. There is no reason that the Army should not be able to at least leverage experience of integrating the system on that helicopter when developing the mounting system for its own Black Hawks. With the danger of shoulder-fired and other lightweight infrared surface-to-air missiles only continuing to expand, the Army will want to make sure it moves to fix these issue as fast as possible in order to make sure it can field these added countermeasures sooner rather than later.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 23, 2018",Navy’s Blue Ridge Class Command Ships Once Had This Wacky Air Defense Missile System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19) recently coming out of a major upgrade and maintenance period, The War Zone ran a feature on the often misunderstood, half century old class of command and control ships. After posting the article we got a flood of email, comments, and instant messages from people who had served on the ships or visited them for a period of time during their careers in the military. We were told repeatedly how great the food was, how the ships’ abilities were far more limited and even neglected in decades past, and other interesting tidbits of information. Maybe the most interesting was about the class’s armament. It turns out the vessels were once equipped with an austere point air defense capability, one that is almost laughably incapable by today’s standards. At its commissioning, USS Blue Ridge was outfitted with a pair of twin Mark 33 three inch guns mounted amidships. These rudimentary deck guns were quickly augmented by a pair of Mark 25 box launchers installed nearby. The Mark 25s housed early versions of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile—which was adapted from the air-to-air missile of a similar name, specifically the AIM-7E. USS Mount Whitney seen in 1986 sporting an air search radar, Mk 25 launchers, and 3 inch gun turrets. , USN The box launchers themselves were adapted from RUR-5 ASROC anti-submarine rocket launchers that were first introduced around 1960. The Mark 25 contained eight RIM-7s, with the launcher being bulkier than the Mark 29 launchers used on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships over the last few decades. The reason being is that early RIM-7s didn’t have folding fins that pop-open as they leave their launch cells, and as we mentioned earlier, the launcher was originally built to accommodate the ASROC. It wasn’t until the RIM-7H that the new fin configuration was put into production. The Basic Point Defense Missile System and its bulky Mark 25 launcher was installed on dozens of Knox class frigates, carriers, and amphibious assault ships., USN This launcher-missile combo was trained to a manually operated turret that had a pair of radar illuminators fixed on both of its sides. This system was called the Mark 115 Manually Aimed Target Illuminator or Manned Director. Wherever this turret was pointed by a sailor standing behind it looking through a scope, the box launcher would point too. When a missile was fired, the idea was that it would immediately lock onto the target being “painted” by the manned illuminator and streak out directly toward it. USN Targeting was a goofy affair in which the guy operating the illuminator would be directed via voice commands to where shipboard radar was seeing a target. The, operator would then swivel the contraption best he could in the direction and elevation he was being told. The system didn’t require perfect visual targeting by the operator as the beam was fairly wide, but he had to keep tracking the target in order for the semi-active radar homing RIM-7 missile to make its way to the target and destroy it. The system became known as the Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS) and was rapidly deployed to ships in the 1970s as a modular design that could take the place of archaic anti-aircraft guns. Clearly it had major limitations. First of all, earlier RIM-7s were terribly suited for surface-to-air missile duty and had anemic range. Half a dozen miles or so was likely the actual reach of this system. The AIM-7E Sparrow missile was designed for sustained cruise in thin air with the kinetic advantage of being launched by a fighter already moving at hundreds of miles per hour, not from the surface of the ocean out of a can. Its centrally-mounted maneuvering fins were also far from ideal for quick reactionary adjustments that a point defense missile systems needs to swat down incoming missiles and aircraft. USS Blue Ridge seen with its Mk 25 launchers and three inch guns, as well as Phalanx mounts, sometime in the late 1990s. The ship also sported a AN/SPS-48 air search radar . , USN Later RIM-7 variations would fix many of these issues, but it wasn’t until the redesigned RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) was introduced in 2004 that most all of the missile’s deficiencies were overcome. The latest versions of the ESSM don’t even rely on any kind of radar illuminator at all, leveraging data-links for initial and midcourse guidance and an active seeker for terminal homing. Sea Sparrow missile being launched from a Mark 25 launcher aboard the USS Midway in 1983. , USN The system was also limited at night and especially in foggy conditions, which are common on the high seas. The ability to engage multiple targets relatively quickly was also sorely lacking, but at least the ship had something to defend itself from enemy aircraft and from Russian anti-ship missiles that could leak through a battle group’s defensive screen. Still, this was a cobbled-together last resort defensive system, and with the installation of the Mark 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system in the early 1980s, the need for marginally effective BPDMS aboard the Blue Ridge class was questioned. USS Blue Ridge and USS Mount Whitney soldiered on with the setup into the early 1990s, when the Mk 25 launchers and Mk 115 directors were finally removed. A Mark 115 fire control director for the Mark 25 SEA SPARROW missile launcher is being removed from the deck of the amphibious command ship USS BLUE RIDGE (LCC-19) in 1993., USN With the Navy investing heavily in these ships—their out of service dates now placed over two decades into the future—it will be interesting to see if the seagoing force provides them with enhanced defensive systems once again. A pair of 25mm Bushmaster cannons on remote weapons mounts were added in recent years for defense against swarming boat attacks and other lower-end threats, and the ships still have their fore and aft Mk 15 Phalanx mounts, but nothing that can reach beyond couple miles. The SeaRAM system, which melds the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and the Phalanx’s independent search and fire control radars into a single self contained package, seems like the most likely option. They could be mounted amidships near where the Mark 25 launchers once sat. It’s also possible that a single SeaRAM system could replace one of the Phalanx mounts. The combination of SeaRAM and Phalanx seems to be the Navy’s defensive mix of choice for ships operating independently in potential super anti-ship missile engagement zones. The Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyers forward based in Spain have been modified to this configuration. USS Mount Whitney in particular operates independently in the Mediterranean and even the Black Sea. The somewhat scary thing is the BPDMS equipped American aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and dozens of Knox class frigates for multiple decades during the Cold War before they were replaced by far more automated and capable systems. One has to think just how bloody a full on barrage of anti-ship missiles by a Russian battlegroup , SSGNs, and/or strategic airpower would have actually been to the American Navy of that era. I don’t think it would have been pretty to say the least. If anything else, the Blue Ridge class’s old manually operated air defense system, which lacked any hard integration with an overall sensor and weapons architecture, is a reminder of just how far the U.S. Navy has come in regards to point defense in the last 50 years.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 11, 2018",US And UAE Are Training To Move Cargo Over Land To Circumvent Volatile Strait Of Hormuz,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A major exercise is underway on the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman dubbed “Native Fury 2018” that has the United States military teaming up with the United Arab Emirates in proving that they can move large quantities of materiel over land in the event that the strategic Strait of Hormuz is closed due to Iranian action. Although there is next to no press on this major logistics exercise, the four star that heads up Central Command, General Joseph Votel , is on sight observing the operation which he described as a “rehearsal of an op plan.” The large scale logistics operation serves two purposes. First it is good training in the event that Iran does “close the strait” via mining and other tactics during a crisis. Second, it proves to Iran that doing so may not have as big an impact militarily as they hope it would, thereby making such an option less desirable. You can see clearly on the map below how conveying cargo and equipment over land could be accomplished within the UAE’s own borders, but Iran has farther reach than just in the strait or in the Persian Gulf. They can deploy throngs of anti-ship missiles to their southeastern shores along the Gulf of Oman, which would still make that area hostile to shipping, albeit that ‘s a far cry from trying to traverse a floating minefield. Any supply ships would need to be escorted by American or allied surface combatants with dense anti-air warfare capabilities under such circumstances. Google Maps Moving cargo through Oman, and then into the UAE may be a safer option depending on the threat scenario, albeit a more complicated one. That is if such an operation would be diplomatically possible. Also, key roadways through the desert are vulnerable to attack, especially by Iranian ballistic missiles. UAE has the THAAD and Patriot missile defense systems in place to fend off low-volume attacks, and the US Navy has its own anti-ballistic missile capabilities, but Iran would likely fire large volumes of ballistic missiles during a conflict, which would make countering the threat completely highly problematic. Also keep in mind that this exercise is about sustaining American and allied military forces operating in and around the Persian Gulf, not in conveying roughly a quarter of the world’s oil supply on any given day. A prolonged closing of the Strait of Hormuz would cause massive damage to the world economy, and it would impact third world countries in extreme ways, which could result in horrific consequences. I have written about this strategic reality in various forms for years , and Iran’s potential play to simultaneously control the Mandeb Strait as well, cutting off traffic into and out of the Red Sea. Some have an almost child-like view of the realities of counter-mine operations and just how much damage Iran could do in conflict in Persian Gulf. Suffice it to say it would be a nightmare, but at least it’s good to see that the Pentagon is really working out alternative methods of supplying its war-fighting machine that could be trapped in and near what is a relatively small body of water. This would very likely include at least one carrier strike group, as well as its troops in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq and other locales. US military vehicles await loading onto a ship in Kuwait. , AP Iran just concluded a surprise set of large scale drills in the Strait of Hormuz that started on the 22nd of January, and all this comes as tensions between the US and Iran are escalating over the Trump Administration’s change in policy towards the country. Most notably this includes a willingness to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal unless major changes to the agreement are made, as well making calls for action over the country’s proxy warfare operations in Syria and Yemen, and their continued development of ballistic missile delivery systems. Looks so peaceful from space, but the Strait of Hormuz is one of the world’s most notorious strategic naval chokepoints., Gallo Images / Copernicus Sentinel 2017/ Orbital Horizon On January 23rd, 2018 Vice President Mike Pence said the following while touring Israel: “We are sending a signal to our European allies that the time has come for changes in the Iran nuclear deal… If our allies won’t join us, President Trump has made clear we will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal immediately… But we hope, we hope in the months ahead to be able to strengthen it.” Here’s Nikki Haley making a dramatic pitch last December for action against Iran for violating U.N. resolutions regarding their missile programs: Meanwhile, America’s closest ally in the region, Israel, has stated officially that Iran’s presence in Syria will not be tolerated, and the Trump Administration seems to share in this sentiment: But really, the Trump Administration’s major shift in tone toward Iran began nearly a year ago with this walk-on statement by the Trump’s very short-lived National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn: External forces aren’t the only major factors that could heavily influence Iran’s future geopolitical actions. The recent widespread protests by Iranians over basic and very relevant gripes with the theocracy that rules their country will continue to have repercussions domestically, with the splintering of Iranian society between moderates and hard-liners—the latter of which has its own military in the form of the Revolutionary Guard Corps—becoming increasingly well defined. So yeah, there’s a lot happening over there, and considering that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could come in a flash, preparing for such an occasion is money and time well spent by the US military and its regional allies.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The year’s first iteration of the USAF’s premier set of aerial war games, known commonly as Red Flag , is kicking off today at Nellis Air Force Base just outside of Las Vegas, but this exercise will be different than any in the past. Not only is it the largest of its kind in the exercise’s 42 year history, but the USAF is going to blackout GPS over the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range to challenge aircrews and their weaponry under realistic fighting conditions. The tactic will spill over throughout the region, with warnings being posted stating inconsistent GPS service could be experienced by aircrews flying throughout the western United States. The disruptions will begin on January 26th and will run through February 16th. Flying.com reports : “The NBAA Command Center reports the U.S. military will begin training exercises on the Nevada Test and Training Range between 0400Z until 0700Z daily. Training maneuvers will impact vast portions of the Western U.S. including California, Nevada, Oregon, Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico. FAA enroute ATC centers affected include Albuquerque (ZAB), Denver (ZDV), Los Angeles (ZLA), Salt Lake (ZLC), Oakland (ZOA) and Seattle (ZSE). Operations in R-2508 and R-2501 may also be impacted. Arrivals and departures from airports within the Las Vegas area may be issued non-Rnav re-routes with the possibility of increased traffic disruption near LAS requiring airborne re-routes to the south and east of the affected area. Aircraft operating in Los Angeles (ZLA) center airspace may experience navigational disruption, including suspension of Descend-via and Climb-via procedures. Non-Rnav SIDs and STARs may be issued within ZLA airspace in the event of increased navigational disruption. Crews should expect the possibility of airborne mile-in-trail and departure mile-in-trail traffic management initiatives.” Those dates and the location perfectly correspond with Red Flag 18-1. The timeframe for the daily disruptions is also the same as the night launch and recovery period for Red Flag this time of year. Two major large force employment missions take place every day during the exercise, one during the light and one during the night, with each last roughly two to three hours. This particular Red Flag includes players from the USAF, USMC, Australia and UK. The very limited guest list of only America’s most trusted allies is indicative of a Red Flag exercise where high-end and sensitive capabilities will be put to the test. According to a press release from the USAF that was posted just hours ago, this seems to be an accurate assumption, with Colonel Michael Mathes, 414th Combat Training Squadron commander, stating : “We’re trying a few new and different things with Red Flag 18-1… It’s the largest Red Flag ever with the largest number of participants, highlighting the balance of training efficiency with mission effectiveness… Red Flag 18-1 primarily is a strike package focused training venue that we integrate at a command and control level in support of joint task force operations… It’s a lot of words to say that we integrate every capability we can into strike operations that are flown out of Nellis Air Force Base.” GPS denial is a becoming a huge issue for American military planners. Peer states, especially Russia , are already putting GPS spoofing and jamming tactics to work during various training events near their own borders. We have discussed this situation in great depth before, and I would suggest you read this article to understand just how deeply the loss of reliable global positioning system data can mean for the U.S. and its allies during a time of war, as well as what is being done to overcome such a monumental hurdle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OxXgOKJu2tM The Pentagon has mysteriously tested technology that can jam GPS over a wide area before, and it is likely that this same capability will be put to use in the Nellis Test and Training Range for this Red Flag 18-1. Line-of-sight and distance impact the way in which GPS users, especially other airplanes, operating far outside the training area will be affected. Here is an article on those tests , which emanated from Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which is located on the western edge of the Mojave Desert in California, in June of 2016. Below is a released image showing how line-of-sight impacts the jammer’s abilities: Map showing how the DoD’s GPS jamming would impact airspace over America’s southwest during a test in June, 2016. , FAA The fact that the Department of Defense is going to execute wide-spread GPS jamming operations during such a high-end exercise is more proof of just how big of a threat these emerging electronic warfare tactics pose. It will be interesting to see if the USAF admits that the technology was indeed used for Red Flag after the exercise concludes, but considering that there are a whole number of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) technologies being developed in hopes to help overcome the loss of GPS during combat, advisories like this one that occur during major military exercises will likely become increasingly normal in the years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details about the mishap are still emerging but we do know that an EA-18G Growler belonging to the Australian Air Force—the only other operator of the type in the world aside from the U.S. Navy—aborted a takeoff out of Nellis Air Force Base at roughly 10:45Am this morning and ended up skidding off the runway. Substantial damage was done to the aircraft, but thankfully the pilot and the electronic warfare officer were able to manually egress from the cockpit safely. In other words, nobody ejected and both crew climbed out of the jet where it came to rest without major injuries. A cloud of black smoke was seen from far away, which was from the fire that ensued. The Australian Growlers are deployed to Nellis for Red Flag 18-1, which has been officially underway since Friday, although large scale launches and recoveries usually don’t occur on the weekends. This rendition of Red Flag is exceptionally large and only includes America’s closest allies with a large focus on electronic warfare and advanced networking and intelligence sharing capabilities. Most notably, large-scale GPS jamming will be used for the event, a story which The War Zone broke yesterday . The jamming will impact GPS service for aircraft as far away from Nevada as Colorado. Australia has sent four Growlers from No. 6 Squadron, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft, and an AP-3C Orion, along with 340 Royal Australian Air Force personnel to take take part in the exercise. The U.S. Navy also has EA-18Gs deployed to Nellis AFB for the drills as well. Growlers of the RAAF sitting on the ramp at Nellis. The jets arrived at the sprawling installation located on the northern edge of Las Vegas just last week., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Pictures of the stricken jet are making their way around social media, which show the aircraft largely intact and upright, but with severe charring from its wings back, including damage to the ALQ-99 electronic warfare pods beneath its wings. A total of 12 EA-18G Growlers are intended to fill-out Royal Australian Air Force ranks as the country works to become a preeminent electronic warfare power. As such, the loss of just one aircraft is a fairly big deal. It’s important to note that aircraft can be replaced, but the lives of its highly trained crew cannot. In this case it’s hard to tell if the jet will fly again, but at least parts of it could reenter the RAAF’s F/A-18F and EA-18G logistics ecosystem. Luckily the RAAF ordered the second lot of F/A-18F Super Hornets with wiring installed that would allow the aircraft to be converted to the Growler configuration later on. So the RAAF will have an option aside from forking over nearly $70M for a new EA-18G. Red Flag 18-1 is slated to run through the 16th of February.

During the first sketch following Ferrell’s monologue he and various cast members poked fun at fighter pilot callsigns. There was some good laughs in the bizarre bit that really only Ferrell could pull off. Check out it out for yourself, and if it doesn’t play in the video frame below this link will take you right to Youtube: You know there will be an unlucky nugget (fresh pilot in a squadron) who is tall with curly hair and an oddball sensor of humor that will end up with the “Clown Penis” handle now. This is not the first time Will Ferrell has played a pilot, he did so a couple times as an SNL cast member and even dramatized Roald Dahl’s early life, including his time as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, for Funny or DIe’s “Drunk History.” Then there is his notorious take on President George W. Bush, which included donning a flight suit for a “mission accomplished” monologue. Ferrell even had a Anchorman-like TV show in the works for NBC where he and Oscar winning writing partner Adam McKay would take on space race astronaut culture in their own hilarious way. Sadly that project, which was supposedly in the process of being developed in 2014, never made it to the small screen. Maybe playing deadly fighter pilot “Clown Penis” will inspire him to make another run at the project.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 28, 2018",Our First Good Look At The EA-18G Growler That Crashed At Nellis AFB Isn’t Pretty,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. So far we’ve only seen a couple very grainy and far-off photos of the Royal Australian Air Force EA-18G Growler that slid off the runway and burst into flames during takeoff on Saturday morning from Nellis AFB, but now a more detailed image has emerged. The photo gives us the first decently clear view of the damage done to the aircraft as a result of the incident. Australianaviation.com.au has posted a photo of the aircraft’s right side showing severe scorching as well as airframe damage to the EA-18G, making the possibility that the jet will fly again increasingly in doubt. Although precise conclusions are hard to draw from just one image, it looks as if the right engine had an uncontained fire that may have burned the aircraft’s empennage from the inside out. It remains unclear what exactly happened that caused the thankfully non-fatal event, but reports of a major engine failure and/or fire fairly late in the Growler’s takeoff run persist. If this was the case, we still don’t know if an explosive, or uncontained engine fire incident occurred on the runway itself, or after as a result of the aircraft ingesting foreign object debris (FOD) once it veered off the runway. The possibility of FOD ingestion on takeoff is possible, especially at Nellis during a Red Flag exercise where the operating areas are especially active with combat aircraft that migrate to the base from around the world, like the doomed Growler from No. 6 squadron which normally calls RAAF Base Amberley home. You can read all about this particular iteration of Red Flag, which is larger in size than the usual affair and leverages unique electronic warfare elements, including GPS jamming, in our our exclusive post on it linked here. One of four Australian Growlers arriving at Nellis last week for Red Flag. , Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The Nellis airfield operations team keeps a very close eye on the base’s runways especially during Red Flag, but all it takes is one piece of an aircraft or munition to find its way onto one of Nellis’s two 10,000 foot long runways to become a potential problem. There still isn’t any official word yet on what happened or how extensive the damage to the Growler is. As we noted in our initial post on the mishap, Growlers are low-density, high-value assets for the RAAF, but there may be alternative means of replacing the scarred jet aside from buying a new one outright: “A total of 12 EA-18G Growlers are intended to fill-out Royal Australian Air Force ranks as the country works to become a preeminent electronic warfare power. As such, the loss of just one aircraft is a fairly big deal. It’s important to note that aircraft can be replaced, but the lives of its highly trained crew cannot. In this case it’s hard to tell if the jet will fly again, but at least parts of it could reenter the RAAF’s F/A-18F and EA-18G logistics ecosystem. Luckily the RAAF ordered the second lot of F/A-18F Super Hornets with wiring installed that would allow the aircraft to be converted to the Growler configuration later on. So the RAAF will have an option aside from forking over nearly $70M for a new EA-18G.” We will update this post throughout the day as more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 22, 2016",Navy Releases Video Of Russian Flanker Buzzing EP-3E Aries II Spy Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports surfaced yesterday of a dangerous encounter between a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II spy plane and a Russian Su-27 derivative Flanker fighter jet over the Black Sea. The Navy says the jet came within five feet of the turboprop surveillance aircraft causing a mission abort and return to base. Now we have some video showing at least a portion of this encounter. Yesterday the Navy released the following statement regarding the intercept: “On Jan. 29, 2018, a U.S. EP-3 Aries aircraft flying in international airspace over the Black Sea was intercepted by a Russian Su-27. This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the Su-27 closing to within five feet and crossing directly through the EP-3’s flight path, causing the EP-3 to fly through the Su-27’s jet wash. The duration of the intercept lasted two hours and 40 minutes. The Russian military is within its right to operate within international airspace, but they must behave within international standards set to ensure safety and prevent incidents, including the 1972 Agreement for the Prevention of Incidents on and Over the High Seas (INCSEA). Unsafe actions‎ increase the risk of miscalculation and midair collisions. The U.S. aircraft was operating in accordance with international law and did not provoke this Russian activity.” Here is the video released today showing an Su-27 making hard maneuvers near the EP-3E: It’s not entirely clear what video system recorded this footage. It could have been a FLIR-like turret, but a pod was also designed and built recently by the Navy to record precisely this type of evidence. In 2016 the Naval Research Laboratory converted an ALQ-167 electronic warfare pod to a new configuration dubbed the Common Airborne Situational Awareness (CASA) pod. As we described in a prior article on the system: “The unit is made up of the housing of a ALQ-167 electronic warfare training pod that has been adapted with apertures for multiple wide-angle HD video and still cameras and the ability to record and transmit the imagery collected by these cameras in real-time. The idea is that this new pod can record an unsafe intercept in great detail from every angle, and that the footage recorded from it will likely be used for public release as well as intelligence gathering purposes.” Regardless of if this system was used or not, the encounter is not an encouraging development considering American surveillance aircraft operate over the Black Sea, and especially near or even over Ukraine, on a daily basis. These include regular flights by RC-135 Rivet Joints, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, and especially RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned spy planes. EP-3E Aries II., Tyler Rogoway/Author Russia has beefed up their air defense capabilities on the Crimean Peninsula dramatically since seizing the territory from Ukraine in 2014. Beyond the Flanker derivatives Moscow has forward-based there, surface-to-air missile capabilities have steadily expanded, and in recent weeks the permanent deployment of Russia’s vaunted S-400 air defense system to Crimea has come to pass. As for Russia’s take on what the intercept in question, RT states : A Russian Su-27 jet has forced an American Lockheed EP-3 surveillance plane to abort its mission over the Black Sea. Moscow says the jet “took all necessary precautions,” while the Pentagon accused it of an “unsafe” intercept. “The entire flight of the Su-27 was conducted in accordance with international regulations, and there were no emergency situations,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Moscow said that the plane was scrambled when as unidentified flying object was detected heading for the Russian border. The Su-27 approached the aircraft and identified it as a US Navy ЕР-3Е Aries II – a commonly used surveillance plane. The ministry said that the jet shepherded it “at a safe distance” before the spy plane changed course away from Russian airspace… …The US State Department has lashed out at Moscow, calling the incident “the latest example of Russian military activities disregarding international norms and agreements.” Denouncing the intercept, it urged Russia “to cease these unsafe actions.” It’s very hard to believe that the EP-3E was classified as unidentified when hobbyist plane trackers could easily track it using virtual radar applications as it made its way toward the Crimean Peninsula. This incident is just one of a seemingly never ending string of similar encounters between Russian fighters and American and NATO aligned aircraft , including those that have occurred time and again over war torn Syria . In fact they are so numerous that we have stopped reporting on them unless there is something new or unique about the encounter. But above all else, this is just another sign of the frigid relations between Moscow and Washington, and it surely won’t be the last time video like this is released by the Department of Defense. Sadly it will most likely take another incident like the one that happened near Hainan Island in 2000 to change anything, but considering how tense things are today, such a miscalculation could end up leading to a major standoff and even a conflict, not just frayed diplomatic nerves. It will be interesting to see how the U.S. responds to this provocation. The surveillance flights won’t stop, but the U.S. could launch fighter escorts out of one of its ally’s bases in the region. This could be seen as a serious escalation by Moscow, and executing such a mission would require persistent tanking support and far more elaborate logistics than just sending a surveillance aircraft into the region on its own, but it may just be necessary considering these recent developments.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 3, 2018","No, Israel’s Interest In Buying New F-15s Isn’t A Referendum On The F-35","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports from Israeli media stating the Israeli Air Force could be leaning towards buying new F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives instead of F-35s have resurfaced in recent days. This has led some to conclude that such a move, if it does indeed occur, would be some sort of knock against the F-35, or even more inaccurately, a validation that the 40 year old F-15 design remains “superior” to that of the leading-edge and stealthy Joint Strike Fighter. These assumptions couldn’t be any further from the truth. The backstory here is fairly simple, the IAF needs to decide what jets it wants to procure under the first part of a massive ten year aid deal that the Obama Administration established with Israel which goes into effect later this year. The IAF has already ordered 50 F-35Is, which are unique in certain ways among other Joint Strike Fighters. That order equates to two squadrons worth of stealth fighters. Another batch of 25 F-35Is would give the IAF another squadron, but there is far more to the IAF’s decision making process than just buying what is considered the newest or even the most advanced fighter available. It’s about force mix and what missions certain aircraft would need to carry out during a number of contingency operations, including an air war over Iran. The F-35I was just declared operational after one year in country. , IAF Israel’s love affair with the F-15 dates back to the very early stages of the type’s operational life. Israel was the first to convert the F-15 into a multi-role platform, using the jet as a long-range strategic asset to pulverize targets far from Israel’s borders. The F-15 “Baz” has since continued to morph into an ever more essential fixture within the ranks of the IAF fighter fleet. Today the IAF’s F-15A/B/C/D fleet has been reworked to a standard uniquely suited for the air superiority, reconnaissance, strike, and even the command and control and communications node roles. Make sure to read all about the F-15’s incredible history serving with the IAF and its adaption into a multi-role platform in this past feature of mine . Not your average Eagle! Israeli F-15A/B/C/Ds “Baz” carries air-to-ground munitions and war “fast pack” conformal fuel tanks. They also have an evolved suite of electronic warfare, communications, radar, and pilot interface capabilities. , IAF The IAF needs the F-15 so bad, especially two seat D models, that it continues to totally refurbish and adapt surplus USAF D models—the first Ds ever built—into the IAF’s unique configuration—and this comes at great cost. You can read all about this ongoing program here . Keep in mind that these are older F-15 “Baz” models, not the F-15I “Ra’am” (Thunder) fleet of jets that were acquired in the late 1990s. The F-15I is a derivative of the F-15E Strike Eagle , and was the IAF’s most advanced and capable fighter aircraft prior to the F-35I being declared operational just weeks ago . Over the years these jets have also received multiple upgrades and feature highly capable electronic warfare and networking capabilities. But with only one squadron in service—just 25 jets—they are few in number, especially considering other regional powers, like Saudi Arabia, is acquiring a fleet of dozens of even more advanced F-15 aircraft (F-15SA) and is converting older Strike Eagle (F-15S) derivatives to a similar advanced configuration. F-15Is taxiing. , IAF So even though the IAF has a large F-15 fleet overall, the vast majority of these aircraft, all but 25 to be exact, were built well before 1986 and have been reworked dramatically, some of them multiple times over. Today the F-15 production line is putting out an aircraft that is far more capable than even the F-15Is that were delivered 20 years ago. Boeing generally calls this aircraft the “Eagle Advanced,” but Qatar, which is ordering dozens of these aircraft, will call theirs the F-15QA. These new variants feature many changes to the original F-15E design, including a digital fly-by-wire system, the activation of weapon stations one and nine on the jet’s outer wings, an AESA radar, a digital electronic warfare system, missile approach warning system, new single glass panel cockpit layout, and the list goes on and on. But regardless of these new capabilities, and even though the F-35 can go places the F-15 can’t, is drastically more survivable for missions in highly contested territory, and has a bunch of features even the most modern Eagle lacks, the F-15 still offers a longer combat radius, can be modified more easily, and maybe most importantly, it can accommodate two crewmen instead of one. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xGY2JBuSCU0 The F-15’s endurance and two-crew configuration allows it to carry out unique roles that the F-35 can’t, and that’s not a knock against the F-35, as it can do many things the F-15 cannot. For most air forces the F-35 would do fine as a single fighter solution, but for the IAF and its unique battle doctrine, this simply isn’t the case at this time. Flying very long range missions, delivering precision standoff munitions with man-in-the-loop terminal guidance , and the ability act as a central networking node and tactical command and control platform aren’t really F-35’s forte—at least when compared to Israel’s two seat Eagle derivatives—nor could the F-35 be easily adapted to compete for these roles in the near term . But the F-15, working as a force multiplier of sorts in these roles, can help the F-35 do its job even better, and both jets can leverage synergistic tactics in the air-to-air and air-to-ground realm . IAF So for the IAF, the question is not about “which is the better fighter?” or some cheesy and irrelevant debate like “which jet wins in a fight?” Instead it’s about planning a total force mix and how to get the very most out of the resources available in order to best accomplish the missions the IAF thinks it will face in the future. The fact that the F-15 production line won’t soldier on forever is another major factor, as well. Once the jet is out of production that’s it, so now is a great time for the IAF to beef up its F-15 force for the decades to come. On the other hand, the F-35 will be in production for decades, and future F-35s will only be better than the ones being delivered now in every single respect, likely including their price tag. IAF Finally, the price difference between the two jets is not really a factor as the unit cost of the F-35I or an updated F-15I derivative will likely be very similar, and Israel has established infrastructure to support both types already. So no, Israel’s potential interest in procuring more F-15s over more F-35s at this time has nothing to do with the F-35’s effectiveness or even its capabilities one way or another. In the IAF’s eyes they are something akin to apples and oranges to a certain degree. In the end, Israel is sure to buy more F-35s—they have stated they plan on acquiring at least 75 —it just may not be immediately. And considering what they use the F-15 for and how the type is likely entering into the twilight of its production run, buying more F-15s is probably more of a necessity than a choice at this particular time. So it all comes down to what tactical fast-jet type does the IAF need the most in order to accomplish the missions it might need to carry out in the not so distant future. This includes gauging what aircraft will create the biggest impact on the IAF’s total force—the vast majority of which isn’t made up of stealth fighters—not simply which aircraft is a “better fighter” judged in a vacuum. Commander Major General Amikam Norkin of the IAF is to submit his recommendation on which jet to buy to the General Staff in May of this year. We will keep you posted as to how the issue progresses.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was a unique moment in American naval history on January 26th, 2018 when the Virginia class fast attack nuclear submarine USS Missouri (SSN-780) arrived in its new homeport of Pearl Harbor, making its way past the famed, albeit retired USS Missouri (BB-63) battleship of the same name. The battleship USS Missouri and the nuclear submarine USS Missouri couldn’t be more different when it comes to warfighting vessels, but the rich heritage and lore that surrounds the name binds the two vessels together, in addition to their now common home. Just four American Navy vessels have been named after the 24th state, with a short-lived side-wheel frigate having been commissioned in 1842 and a Maine class battleship (BB-11) being commissioned in 1903 under the same moniker. USS Missouri (BB-11) served for 16 years in America’s turn of the century navy. , Public Domain/wikicommons The Iowa class Battleship USS Missouri is by far the most famous of the lot, having participated in WWII, the Korean War, and the Gulf War. It also starred in the 1990s Steven Seagal action blockbuster Under Siege. Yet the vessel is probably best known for Japan’s signing of the official instrument of surrender on its teak deck, a moment that marked the end of horrific World War II. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signing the Instrument of Surrender on behalf of the Japanese Government, formally ending World War II., USN The submarine USS Missouri was commissioned in 2010 and was originally based out of Groton, Connecticut before the orders to mover her and her crew to Oahu came down. Packing up her 160 sailors and officers and their families and moving them thousands of miles away to an island in the Pacific is no small task, but it’s hard to ask for a better station than gorgeous Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor. USN/Wikicommons One thing the battleship and its nuclear submarine counterpart have in common is weaponry. The submarine USS Missouri’s primary land attack weapon is the RGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. The battleship Missouri received Tomahawk capability during her final refit in the 1980s via the installation of armored box launchers on her deck. At 01:40 am on January 17th, 1991 the ship fired its first Tomahawk in anger at Iraqi targets, followed by 27 additional missiles over the next five days. Desert Storm would also see the Missouri and her sister-ship the Wisconsin pull off the largest naval feint in decades with their mighty 16 inch guns . The Mighty Mo shells the Kuwaiti coastline during Desert Storm., USN Although there have been calls for the Navy to bring back these hulking antique vessels over the last two and a half decades, doing so would be a major undertaking and the cost would be massive. Even Donald Trump mentioned the idea while campaigning for President in 2016. A new crop of proponents for bringing back the Iowa class has emerged in recent years, with many basing their reasoning on the fact that modern surface combatants are vulnerable to anti-ship missile damage and potential cyber attacks. USS Missouri fires a Tomahawk cruise missile. , CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images Considering the Navy’s dumbed-down DDG-1000 Zumwalt class stealth destroyers won’t receive the ammo originally designed for their 155mm deck guns, and just three of these vessels have been ordered, there still isn’t an operational capability to satisfy the naval gunfire support requirement —which was lost when the Iowa class was put into mothballs in the early 1990s. Regardless of the great battleship and naval gunfire support debate, the arrival of the submarine USS Missouri , which like its forbearer goes by the nickname of “The Mighty Mo,” at Naval Base Pearl Harbor resulted in one hell of a photo opportunity. The vessel’s sailors were decked out in their white uniforms as the submarine quietly passed by its namesake and the USS Arizona Memorial.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 22, 2018",This Is Our Best View Yet Of China’s Ship-Mounted Railgun Prototype,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We were among the first to report yesterday on images coming out of China showing the Haiyang Shan , a Type 072III-class landing ship equipped with what appeared to be an experimental electromagnetic railgun installed on its bow. Make sure to read our original post linked here for full background on this development, but now a new photo has emerged showing a highly detailed view of the massive deck gun. Roughly a day after the first images came to light, it seems as if the consensus is that this is indeed a railgun or some sort of hybrid prototype design. No other existing weapon or known planned system matches the size of the gun’s massive cupola no the extremely fat profile of its barrel. The closest some could find was the Type 055 destroyer’s H/PJ38 130mm deck gun or the PLZ05 155mm self-propelled howitzer’s gun system, but neither of these are anywhere near the scale as the system installed on the Haiyang Shan. Others have floated the possibility that this installation could be some sort of large caliber naval mortar system , but the size of the turret, its elaborate barrel system, and the overall configuration of temporary infrastructure installed on the ship doesn’t seem to support that idea, not to mention such a system would have debatable utility. Still we can’t totally rule it out. (Tweet translation: The reason for using the 072 type landing ship is the same as the above 2.The deck of the type 072 is large, can be installed a number of power generation equipment, and can also be installed in a wide variety of facilities because it has a large hangar inside. The part reflected in the Photograph: the control device from the left of the deck, the generator. A new observation room and a facility were installed to observe the test on the bridge.) If this is indeed a railgun, the idea that China could put a weapon as advanced as this to sea—even in an experimental form—should serve as a huge gut check for the Pentagon which has chronically underestimated the Beijing’s ability to field advanced weapons over the last decade. Some good could come out of such a development though. After toiling with EM railgun technology for a decade, the U.S. Navy could double-down on its own efforts to mature the technology into an operational format—or at least one that can finally be tested at sea. In 2014, it was planned that a railgun was going to be deployed for tests aboard a Spearhead class high-speed logistics ship in 2017, but then it seemed that the Navy’s brass wanted to bypass at sea testing altogether. Navy Admiral Pete Fanta, then the director of surface warfare and now the head of warfare integration, told Defense News in 2016: “I would rather get an operational unit out there faster than do a demonstration that just does a demonstration.” Such logic seems extremely questionable especially for such a cutting-edge technology. The Pentagon has been bogged down by far less ambitious “concurrent” development, testing, and production projects recently, leaving the idea that a railgun could follow a similar path and be successful as almost a laughable proposition. But the ambitions of admirals and the realities of the immature technology seems to have caught up with the Navy over the last year. We wrote the following in a piece on the Navy’s railgun project in March of 2017: In spite of these developments, the Navy hasn’t changed its timeline for when the electrically-powered cannons will be operational since at least 2015, according to a March 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service. The service still reportedly expects the guns to be in action by 2025. The potential for more difficulties – old or new – has not been lost on members of Congress, many of whom are looking to expand the defense budget, but have no interest in programs that might never produce results. “Although the Navy in recent years has made considerable progress, a number of significant development challenges remain,” CRS noted in its review. “Overcoming these challenges will likely require years of additional development work, and ultimate success in overcoming them is not guaranteed.” Recently it has been widely reported that the Navy has quietly stepped away from their railgun dreams due to the huge technological hurdles that still remain. Over the last month we have reached out to the Office of Naval Research time and again to confirm that this is in fact the case without response. If indeed the Navy has recently sidelined their railgun project, its status could change drastically due to these recent foreign developments. And this prompts another question—did American intelligence services see China’s breakthroughs in railgun technologies coming or not? We have contacted the Pentagon for comment and we will let you know what we hear back.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 5, 2020",Boeing’s Hypersonic Valkyrie Will Likely Struggle To Catch Up With Lockheed’s SR-72,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing surprised the aerospace world with the unveiling of their own notional hypersonic aircraft design that intends to compete with Lockheed’s shadowy hypersonic demonstrator aircraft and its upscaled “SR-72” platform that could follow. But this news comes as more evidence has emerged supporting The War Zone’s long held claim that Lockheed’s Skunk Works is much farther along in the development process of their hypersonic aircraft than they try to let on. Lockheed’s incessant chatter about developing a notional “SR-72” hypersonic (greater than mach five speed) reconnaissance and strike aircraft caused me to conclude that the initiative was much farther along than what we were being outright told. Eventually I even wrote a piece just on this alone , along with a fallow-up about a claimed sighting of such an aircraft at the USAF sprawling Plant 42 installation in Palmdale, California. Lockheed’s “SR-72” design., Youtube screencap from Lockheed video. Early in January, 2018 more evidence to support exactly this hypothesis emerged via a speech given by Lockheed’s Jack O’Banion , Vice President of Strategy and Customer Requirements, Advanced Development Programs (Skunk Works), at The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SciTech conference. During the address, O’Banion clearly referred to the company’s hypersonic aircraft as if it was already a reality, stating in part: “Without the digital transformation, the aircraft you see there could not have been made. In fact, five years ago, it could not have been made.” You can watch his comments on livestream here . Fast forward to the 59 minute mark. Now we see Boeing jumping into the fray with their own design—unveiled in model form at the same conference that O’Banion made his eyebrow-raising remarks—which seems more like an attempt to compete in what is becoming an increasingly clear future growth space than anything else. And this push didn’t begin yesterday. In 2016 Boeing initiated a study with its propulsion partner Orbital ATK on a “combined cycle” engine similar to the one Lockheed proposes for its SR-72 concept according to Aviation Week. Additionally, Boeing has decades’ worth of research from other high-speed programs it and the companies it has gobbled have been a part of over the years to leverage as well, going as far back as the XB-70 Valkyrie —which this new notional aircraft is named after—to more modern programs like the X-51A and X-43 hypersonic demonstrators. Other past clandestine programs also likely factor in to Boeing’s breadth of knowledge on this exotic area of aeronautics, as is the case for Lockheed as well. Lockheed Martin Boeing envisions a similar design and test evolution for their proposed hypersonic program as Lockheed put forward years ago, which includes creating a fighter-sized demonstrator vehicle for initial testing, and then upscaling that design into a large operational aircraft roughly the same size as the SR-71 Blackbird. And like Lockheed’s offering, Boeing’s would also be unmanned. As far as the two designs go, they look very similar, although Boeing’s offering utilizes a single inlet design reminiscent of its XB-70 Valkyrie namesake and has some features similar to the X-43, like its twin tails. It seems possible that Boeing is looking to get the USAF interested in some type of competition between it and Lockheed for an operational hypersonic aircraft contract in the future. Seeing as both firms propose the same pathway to getting there, including flying smaller demonstrators first, such a goal may seem logical at face value. But considering this is highly sensitive technology that would exist in the compartmentalized (classified) world, a traditional “fly-off” is unlikely. Above all else, it seems as if Lockheed is already at or beyond that stage with their own program and the USAF isn’t likely to wait around for Boeing to catch up. Lockheed’s unique pedigree in this space is also undeniable, with the SR-71 under their belt and probably a bunch of other high-speed test programs that have taken place in shadows over the last half century. In other words, although Boeing’s interest in the reusable hypersonic aircraft space is admirable, the jet may have already left the hangar so to speak. Boeing has received some funding from the Air Force Research Laboratory into hypersonic powerplant design, but unless the firm is willing to self-fund the development of a flying prototype, it seems unlikely the Valkyrie II concept could compete with Lockheed in the near term. And it costs big bucks to undertake such an effort, with Lockheed’s CEO Marillyn Hewson stating in the past that a fighter-sized hypersonic demonstrator alone would likely run about a billion dollars. Boeing’s hypersonic plane design features a similar inlet as found on its namesake, the XB-70 Valkyrie. , USAF A similar situation seems to have occurred in the late 2000s when it comes to stealthy penetrating unmanned aircraft, another space where Lockheed quietly succeeded in while Boeing, who pioneered the technology in the unclassified realm, was left without any major prospects. You can read about this saga in this past TWZ special feature. Regardless of who stands the best chance of becoming America’s prime hypersonic plane provider, one thing is clear, in an age of where peer-state competition is once again all the rage, hypersonic vehicles of all types are slowly creeping onto center stage , and America’s potential enemies aren’t sitting still in this regard either. With this in mind, there will be room for multiple purveyors when it comes to future hypersonic weaponry in general, but for such a niche capability as a large reusable hypersonic aircraft, that is probably not the case.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 15, 2017",Russian Su-25 Frogfoot Attack Jet Shot Down In Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain very limited in nature but what is known is that a Russian Su-25 Frogtfoot ground-attack jet was brought down in contested Idlib Province in Syria. It is not fully clear what weapon brought the aircraft down, but some reports state that it was a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS), otherwise known as a shoulder-fired heat-seeking missile. Images and video are already coming out of Syria, with one image showing what appears to be a Su-25 with an engine on fire, and a video clearly showing the wreckage of a Russian Frogfoot. The aircraft was totally destroyed and reports say that the pilot ejected, although his current status is unknown at the time of publishing. The Su-25 has served as the backbone of Russia’s air campaign over Syria, with roughly half a dozen or more of the type usually taking up residence at Russia’s air base located south of Latakia, Syria. The shoot-down comes two months after President Vladimir Putin declared major combat operations over during a surprise visit to Syria. It also comes following a series of complex attacks on Russia’s Syrian air base, one of which was deadly. As such, it seems as if Syria is becoming more dangerous for Russian troops, not less. A Russian Su-25 pilot mounts up before a sortie over Syria. The Su-25, which is very roughly analogous to the American A-10 Warthog close air support (CAS) jet, has been the backbone of Russia’s air campaign over Syria., AP MANPADS have been present in Syrian , but not plentiful by any regard. There has been talk of foreign powers possibly inserting the sensitive weapons into the Syrian conflict to help level the playing field against Syrian air power, but this hasn’t come to pass. That being said, there has been an uptick in reports of high-end MANPADS being spotted on the Syrian battlefield as of late, along with some supporting video. Still we cannot confirm one of these missiles brought the Russian jet down. We will update this post as more info comes available. Update: 8:15am PST— More video from the crash site: This is probably the dumbest place to be standing in Syria. Update: 6:15pm PST– The aircraft shot down was Su-25SM serial number RF-96486 “Blue 06.” Russia says the pilot of the Su-25 died heroically while fighting terrorists after landing following the ejection from his stricken jet. Images of the pilot’s standard issue Stechkin automatic pistol with an empty magazine supposedly supports this statement. Russian outlet RT also says that a letter of commendation was pulled from the dead pilot’s pocket, stating: “One of the pictures, published on the CIT Facebook page, shows what appears to be a commendation authored by special operations air group commander Lt. Colonel Sergey Aksenov, recommending that a state award be bestowed upon Filippov for completing combat missions in Syria. CIT claims the document was found in the slain pilot’s pocket.” Russian officials confirmed that the aircraft was attacked and brought down by a MANPADS. It is worth noting that on February 2nd, just a day before the loss of this Su-25, another Frogtfoot narrowly escaped being shot down by anti-aircraft fire in the same region. RT also reports that the following group is responsible for the attack: “Tahrir al-Sham, an extremist group linked to Al-Nusra terrorists, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier, videos and statements about the Russian pilot appeared on the Twitter account of the Jaysh al-Nasr, a militant group affiliated to the Free Syrian Army.” Moscow says it quickly located those responsible for the shoot-down and launched a “massive precision strike” on a compound they were inhabiting. That counter-strike is shown in the video below. Russia claims 30 fighters were killed in the operation. https://youtube.com/watch?v=vOCOBFwnFnI Russian media outlet Sputnik inquired with the Pentagon as to the possibility that the U.S. furnished MANPADS to rebel groups in Syria, this was Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon response: “Alongside by, with, and through our partners in Syria, the United States remains focused on the fight against ISIS.. The US has not equipped any partner forces in Syria with surface-to-air weapons and has no intention to do so in the future. Our operations are geographically focused on ongoing combat operations against ISIS in eastern Syria. We will assess the validity of these claims to ensure the safety of our coalition partners. I refer you to the Russian government for information regarding this incident.” The Sputnik report goes on talking about rumors that the U.S. has supplied MANPADS to Kurdish fighters in Afrin and to other groups in the past. Any major negative news for Russia that occurs in Syria usually results in at least some form of tacit blame or vague allegations of responsibility being placed on the United States by Russian media. This incident appears to be no different, and Russia’s hunt for who provided the missile that shot down the Su-25 will be an interesting one follow to say the least. Frants Klintsevich, first deputy chair of Russia’s Federal Council Defense Committee, stated the following earlier today: “Certainly, we will investigate, including a great many things: from the type of the MANPADS to the circumstances of the Su-25 downing… The loss of one aircraft is nothing, but politically it has great significance and far-reaching consequences… We have information that the MANPADS used to bring down our jet was brought into Syria from a neighboring country several days ago… Countries from whose territory weapons arrive, that are then used against Russian servicemen, must understand that who is will not go unpunished…” Deputy head of the state Duma Defense Committee, Yury Shvytkin, also added: “ MANPADS’ origins are linked with Western countries.” Update: 9:20am PST +1 day— Video has surfaced that supposedly shows the hit: This video may show the MANPADS launch: Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though its roots date back to the 1970s, the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack jet program still seems like something out of a science fiction. From the early test flights of its Have Blue progenitor, to everything from the program’s “Klingon Cloaking Device,” to its “Toxic Death” paint scheme , to puzzling components of the aircraft that are still coming to light, to the unique the role it played in cross-Atlantic executive relations , it seems the smaller stories related to the program can be just as interesting as the big ones . This is especially true if those stories have to do with nearly a decade of flying under highly classified restrictions deep in the Nevada desert at Tonopah Test Range Airport . Lockheed As “vampire life” was in full swing during the most deeply classified period of the program (read all about it here ), with the remote base coming alive at night to launch and recover “Black Jets” that officially didn’t exist, a slew of security measures were put into place to make sure that shroud over the F-117 wouldn’t be lifted prematurely. Even the base’s runway had gates that would only allow access to the taxiway when the aircraft was approved to do so. T-38 Talon assigned to the F-117 program taxis out to the runway at Tonopah Test Range Airport in 1989. Double gated fencing just to get on and off the runway was a clear indicator of just how sensitive the base’s tenants were about security. The gates are still in use today. , USAF With the Pentagon’s generous “black budget” of the Reagan years, new technology was brought to bear in an attempt to enhance security surrounding highly sensitive programs. One piece of equipment that looked like it was ripped right out of a 1980s sci-fi action adventure movie in particular was an early form of biometric scanner called the Identimat built by Stellar Systems. These hand scanners, which were installed at the F-117’s clandestine home near Tonapah were indeed ambitious for their time, but just because they looked super futuristic didn’t mean they worked well. The system worked by reading the length and curvature of one’s fingers and finger webbing via a series of photocells installed in grooves over which a person’s hand was placed. A pin stuck up between the middle and ring fingers to center a user’s hand perfectly along the groves. A bright 1,000 watt overhead lamp shined on the persons hand form above and the system would compare the geometry of the user’s hands with the data stored on file. Two versions of the Identimat, one with a card scanner and the other without. , Stellar Systems/Public Domain Four lights could illuminate on the scanner enclosure, one being to prompt a right hand scan, another to prompt a left hand scan, and one for access granted/pass and another for no access/fail. Programmers could set the system’s “bias” very high to make it more reliable, or very low to make it much more discriminating—letting fewer unintended individuals through—but also resulting in far more scanning errors. The system worked in tandem with a personal identification number as well a card that interfaced with a magnetic stripe reader that was activated while the person’s hand was on the scanner. A user got two or three tries at each hand, and if the dimensions matched within a narrow margin of error the individual passed and was admitted to a secured area. If the person failed, a security officer would have to identify them personally and then reprogram the machine so that it would work in the future. Having to scan one’s left hand was a pain because the scanners were located on the right side of a turnstyle/control line. Reader submission., Identimat being used at a sensitive military site in the 1980s. The reality was that the elaborate system worked pretty damn poorly and seemed to have a mind of its own as to when it wanted to approve a scan or not. This resulted in major logjams of personnel trying to get to their posts at very particular times—frustrating to say the least. The scanners were especially troublesome for the F-117 program’s Materials Application Repair Section (M.A.R.S.) personnel, better known as “Martians,” who labored tirelessly to keep the stealth jet’s radar absorbent—not to mention toxic—skin in perfect order. Cuts, contusions, blisters, and broken digits were very common among them, making getting past the Identimat a futile proposition at times. Materials Application Repair Section (M.A.R.S.) are largely the unsung heroes of the F-117 and other stealth programs., USAF Apparently versions of the Identimat also outfitted some high-security nuclear facilities as well, some of which were located (and still are) not that far from Tonopah, namely the Department of Energy’s sprawling National Test Site to the south, buried within the Nevada Test and Training Range . Supposedly the Identimat system began development in the late 1960s and was shown off in the 1970s. By the time it was being adopted and even tested for civilian applications in the 1980s, more capable image-sensing biometric technology was emerging. And above all else, the system was unreliable and just a major pain to operate. By 1987 the product was pulled from the market and the scanners disappeared from highly sensitive sites, including Tonopah Test Range Airport, not long after. One can only wonder how much someone made selling this stinker to the Pentagon back then, especially in an age of $37 screws and $640 toilet seats. Regardless, the Identimat is yet another facet of a real life top secret aircraft program that continues to prove that the science fiction dreams of the 1980s were reality out in the middle of the southern Nevada desert.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 30, 2018",It’s Back To The Future For U.S. F-15C Eagles And Conformal Fuel Tanks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing posted an image today of a Louisiana Air National Guard F-15C wearing a pair of conformal fuel tanks (CFTs). The tanks are part of a new initiative to give the F-15C fleet more gas and weapons carrying capability in order to execute what the Air National Guard calls future “persistent air dominance missions.” The 159th Fighter Wing “Bayou Militia” is the first unit to receive the tanks for testing and evaluation. Boeing’s Randy Jackson stated the following in an email to the The War Zone: “The first flight with the tanks was achieved in just 10 months after the start of the program and marks a major milestone in establishing the operational utility of the conformal fuel tanks. Boeing received a multimillion dollar contract from the NATO Support and Procurement Agency in early 2017 for initial integration, testing and support, and delivered the tanks ahead of schedule. The first test flight on January 31st lasted two hours and took place over the Gulf of Mexico.” The little-known of program is officially called the F-15 Persistent Air Dominance Enabler. Here’s an excerpt from the Air National Guard’s 2017 priorities document that explains the program and its costs: USAF This major upgrade is part of a series of upgrades—which include a new digital countermeasures suite, infrared search and track system, new cockpit, among other enhancements—that are slated to allow the F-15C/D fleet to soldier on till 2040 and possibly beyond. The aircraft that receive these upgrades are called “Golden Eagles.” It is worth noting that last year the USAF repeatedly questioned the F-15C/D Eagle’s long term future, with the bringing up its structural longevity as a major concern and floating the idea of replacing the type entirely with upgraded F-16s. Currently the USAF has only eight operational F-15C/D squadrons, with five of those belonging to the Air National Guard. As the excerpt alludes to, the CFTs will not only extend the F-15C’s range, but they will also allow the jet’s two wing hardpoints to be freed up for more weapons. Currently two air-to-air missiles and a 600 gallon drop tank are commonly carried on each wing station. The new multi-rail launcher mentioned in the official document has been displayed on Boeing’s advanced F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives before, and can hold up to four AIM-120 AMRAAMs. It remains unclear exactly how many weapons, and exactly type of weapons, the F-15C’s new CFTs can carry beyond AIM-120s. Boeing The ability to carry at least an extra four AIM-120s without severely limiting the F-15C’s fuel load will go a long way in giving the jet more combat punch, and will help with the implementation of cooperative tactics where the F-15s can act as arsenal ships for stealthy fighters operating forward of the Eagle’s position, deeper into contested airspace. We have described these tactics multiple times and you can read about them here . It also opens up new tactical opportunities should the F-15C receive a very-long range air-to-air missile , and/or more numerous and smaller hit-to-kill air-to-air weapons that are currently in development. The CFTs could also help free up space and minimize drag for Eagles carrying large networking systems, like the Talon Hate pod , or other future outsized modular systems. The Eagle’s conformal fuel tanks, also known as “FAST packs,” have been around almost as long as the F-15 itself, first being test flown in 1974. I wrote all about the Eagle’s CFTs and their origin in a past feature about how the Israeli Air Force has modified the F-15 since early on for its unique needs, stating: “One of the features that the F-15E would be built with was conformal fuel tanks, otherwise known as “FAST Packs,” as in Fuel And Sensor Tactical Packs. These flank hugging 849 gallon tanks were not new to the F-15 with the advent of the Strike Eagle, in fact they were envisioned as an option for the F-15C/D and even retrofittable to the A and B models early on, with the first test flight being flown with them attached to an Eagle in the mid 1970s. They were envisioned to carry everything from fuel to cargo, although the majority of these concepts never made it to fruition.” Early FAST pack configurations drawing from the 1970s., Public Domain “USAF Eagles only took limited advantage of FAST packs, with some jets deployed to Iceland or stationed in Alaska using them sporadically for the long-range air sovereignty role. The IAF on the other hand saw the great utility in these conformal fuel tanks, not just to enhance range, but to make their air superiority focused Bazs true multi-role heavy fighters. Like those found on the F-15E, F-15 Baz’s conformal tanks could be fitted with hardpoints for air-to-air missiles or for bombs. This allows for the Baz [Israel’s name for the air superiority F-15A/B/C/D Eagle] to fly missions with a pair of underwing tanks and even a centerline tank while still being able execute air-to-ground missions. Today, many Bazs can be seen fitted with indigenously developed FAST Packs built by IAI, but the fact is these were flying on the IAF’s F-15s many decades ago.” USAF F-15s flying air patrols and intercepts out of Iceland during the Cold War wore FAST packs. , USAF Conformal fuel tanks on the F-15C add nearly 12,000lbs of gas to the jets 13,850lbs of internal fuel with only slight performance penalties and are much more aerodynamically efficient than the 600 gallon drop tanks normally carried under the F-15C’s wings and fuselage. This begs the question: why did the USAF stop using CFTs in the first place? That is a complicated question, but by some accounts the time it took to pull the CFTs of for maintenance was one issue. The fact that the USAF had a surplus of virtually everything, including tankers and F-15s, following the end of the Cold War meant that squeezing every bit of performance out of every tactical aircraft simply wasn’t a high priority. The fighter-pilot dominated culture of the USAF may have also played a part in the decision. 600 gallons tanks can be dropped in an instant to give back the F-15’s maximum maneuverability and kinematic potential during combat. CFTs on the other hand can’t be jettisoned, and the small performance penalty they dock from the jet is there as long as they are attached. FAST packs sit alongside an F-15C back in the 1980s., USAF Although these factors may help explain why the USAF never fully adopted the CFT concept for their own F-15C/D fleet during and shortly after the Cold War, it doesn’t explain why it took so long for them to show up again on USAF Eagles. Considering the drawdown in force size to roughly just 200 F-15C/D Eagles over the last two and a half decades, the fact that the type guards America’s maritime borders, and the harsh realities of future anti-access/area denial combat environments where tankers will be increasingly vulnerable to attack, the need for CFTs on America’s F-15C/D fleet has never been greater. And once again, Israel has shown just how useful the capability can be over decades of service, and the USAF’s own multi-role F-15Es only operate with their own CFTs attached. But the old adage “better late than never” is very relevant here, and the fact that the Air National Guard is betting big on CFTs is downright exciting. This, along with the other upgrades slated for the oldest of America’s Eagles, will make the jet more potent and independently capable than it has ever have been. The addition of CFTs to the Guard’s Eagle fleet will also make arguments for replacing the 40 year old jets with updated F-16s less potent as an F-16 equipped with its own conformal tanks cannot compete with a CFT equipped Eagle in terms of range, and it’s not even close when it comes to missile carriage capabilities. A Bayou Militia Eagle fires off an AIM-120 AMRAAM., USAF Although new sensors and podded system are in the Air Guard’s F-15C/D’s future, the addition of CFTs with extra hardpoints could also point to the possibility that the F-15C/D could finally get a secondary air-to-ground role like their IAF counterparts. I know this sounds like blasphemy to the “not a pound for air-to-ground” F-15C/D pilot cadre, but even a limited strike capability could help preserve the type’s existence into the future. We’ll keep you informed as to how the Air Guard CFT integration progresses, but one thing seems glaringly clear—like a fine wine, the F-15 just gets better with age and the Air National Guard has the vision and the guts to make the world’s most proven and deadly jet fighter the best it can possibly be.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 25, 2019",Veteran Aerospace Reporter’s Old File Cabinet Is Full Of 2000s Military Treasure,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A few weeks ago our good friend Stephen Trimble , the big cheese over at Flightglobal’s Americas Bureau and possibly the world’s most well-traveled human, cleaned out an old file cabinet in his office. As he dug through old papers of all types, he began to notice that the cabinet was a time capsule of sorts full of military program briefs from the last decade. It almost served as a “greatest hits” of abortive defense concepts from that period, some of which sucked up billions of dollars before meeting the budgetary axe, others just couldn’t find a market, but all were fascinating to look back upon. Stephen started to post some snap shots of his unexpected walk down memory lane on Twitter, when I quickly approached him to see if we could do a story on the best of his finds, and of course he was totally in. Stephen described the special filing cabinet to The War Zone as such: “That big gray file cabinet sat beside my desk, but I hadn’t opened it in at least 10 years. Technically, it wasn’t mine. It belonged to my predecessor, and he was a bit of a pack-rat. When he left the company, he also left the journalism profession, so he bequeathed his copious and neatly organized files on his somewhat dazed and ill-informed successor. I started at Flightglobal 15 years ago, and that file cabinet was my secret weapon my first few years on the job. This was in the era just before the great digitization of all important documents. Paper still was king. Those hanging, green file dividers contained all manner of necessary materials: Specifications, high-resolution photos and printed out copies of those impressively informative press conferences of yesteryear, before the industry’s corporate lawyers decided basic information about their products was intellectual property, guarded with more jealousy than the gold at Fort Knox. After a few years, of course, the relevance and currency of the information stored in that file cabinet had run its course. I had filled up an adjoining file cabinet with fresh material on a new generation of programs, like KC-X, and JSF, and JCM and, well, KC-X again. But I never threw out any of my predecessor’s stuff. A decade or so went by and eventually our company bought another company. Somebody noticed we now owned two offices in the metropolitan DC area, so one had to close down and consolidate with the other, and that was our office. So, for the first time in more than a decade, I opened my predecessor’s file cabinet. It was no longer my secret weapon. It was instead a time capsule of the aerospace industry circa the late 1990s and 2000s. File names that once bore so much importance—Comanche, MC2A, BRJ-X, LOCAAS—now seemed like lost relics of a different era, preserved on an irrelevant medium like paper. It probably took me three or four times the minimum required to go through all that period, but I didn’t mind it at all.” Below is a taste of some of the briefs Stephen came across while on his cleaning mission. Taken together, these four programs sort of encapsulate the aerospace-defense industry’s failed hopes and dreams of a decade. But just because these programs never came to fruition, the concepts behind them, and some of the technologies developed for them, have benefited other programs that proved to be far more successful. For instance, technology and some of the concepts behind Comanche ended up in the latest AH-64 Apache variants. Its stealth technology certainly influenced Sikorsky’s now legendary “Stealth Hawk” low-observable H-60 Black Hawk derivative that helped make the Bin Laden raid a success. Low Cost Autonomous Attack System, better known as LOCAAS, was a progenitor of the swarming unmanned concepts and autonomous standoff munitions technology we see today. Boeing’s stealthy Silent Eagle F-15 concept helped pave the way to less ambitious but still very important upgrades to existing F-15s . It also influenced the configuration and capabilities mix of the next generation F-15, the F-15 Advanced, and its derivatives that are now flying with the Saudi Air Force and will be delivered in an even more potent form to Qatar, and possibly Israel , in the coming years. Maybe the most frustrating loss of all was the F136 alternative engine for the F-35. But GE has leveraged its development for other programs, and it will likely influence the next leap in fighter aircraft powerplants, such as those being developed for the Adaptive Engine Transition Program ran by the Air Force Research lab. Anyway, here are those briefs, enjoy the memories!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 30, 2017",Here’s What You Missed From Last Night’s Big North Korean Military Parade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What an interesting day it has been for those who monitor North Korean military and regime activities closely. Pyongyang’s grand military review through Kim Il Sung Square, which came to us last year via heavy on-site international news coverage that broadcasted it live and in high detail, turned into a shell game of sorts this year. As many in the United States waited for the show to begin last evening, what they didn’t know is the parade had in fact already occurred many hours earlier, with the regime controlling all media from the exhibition with an iron fist. If anything else the ruse was a testament to—and a reminder of—just how wily the regime can be when it wants to and how closed off the country really is from the outside world. In the end the broadcast didn’t air until around midnight Pacific Standard Time, but at least it aired at all. The game of media cat-and-mouse really isn’t that surprising considering just how tense things have become between Washington and Pyongyang. The notoriously paranoid regime surely thinks that massing tens of thousands of soldiers, hundreds of pieces of military equipment, and nearly all of the regime’s top leadership, including Kim Jong Un, in one place at one time is a major risk. A little unpredictability goes a long way, even if American and South Korea intelligence were likely well aware of the strange scheduling feint in real time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=auh5uZiAASw Taping the event and broadcasting it hours later also provided a hedge against showcasing potentially embarrassing issues, like vehicle breakdowns and other mishaps in the parade program. It is too early to tell if any creative editing was done to make the parade of weapons and troops look larger than it was, but major changes seem unlikely because the parade was clearly smaller than the ones in year’s past, and especially in comparison to the one a year ago . But that doesn’t mean the heavy weapons that everyone was most interested in seeing didn’t materialize. Considering the blistering sanctions that North Korea is currently under, which has dramatically impacted the country’s fuel reserves, the fact that they had a parade at all is impressive. And although this one was smaller, it still included all the usual elements and a few notable new ones as well. But once the truncated parade of tactical weaponry had largely passed the review stand, the lineup went right into large ballistic missiles, and this time there wasn’t any need to guess as to what we were seeing. For the first time ever, every big missile shown has been flown and validated to some degree. And yes, the largest of Kim Jong Un’s weapons, the first intercontinental ballistic missile ever fired by the country, the Hwasong-14 (HS-14) was on full display, as was its menacing bigger brother, the Hwasong-15 (HS-15). CSIS So without further ado, here are the main takeaways from the parade, at least at first glance. Additional intriguing elements may come to light in the near future, but this roundup will provide the highlights and some very important conclusions. Here is last year’s analysis which proved to be eerily accurate. You can compare it to this years and see that although not a ton has changed, strategically it’s a whole new ballgame. Youtube Screen Kim Jong Un, wearing all black with his signature fedora, was the center of attention as always. He gave a brief speech and then took in the display with his regime henchmen by his side. His wife Lee Seol-ju was also in attendance, which is a fairly rare occurrence for an event like this. Youtube Screenshot After the normal military parade ground pomp and circumstance, a formation of AN-2 biplanes—a seemingly innocuous aircraft that is actually a key weapon in North Korea’s arsenal —made a fairly impressive flyover. The formation spelled out “70” and coordinated flare releases looked very nice, which also spelled 70 one after another. The picture doesn’t do it justice, it looked very well done. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the party and the North Korean nation as we know it today. Later on a formation of Su-25 ground attack jets also did a large fan-break over the parade ground. Once again, for a country supposedly suffocating from fuel shortages, this was surprising. , Youtube Screencap The Chuch’e-Po self-propelled artillery pieces had an interesting secondary weapons turret up top, it almost looks like a remote system. Also note the twin MANPADS attached to that turret. This was even more common than last year, with many of the armored vehicles having MANPADS attached in one way or another. Clearly the North Korean military is preparing to rebuff South Korean and American battlefield interdiction platforms, like the A-10 Warthog, AH-64 Apache, AH-1 Cobra, and other low-flying armed scout and attack helicopters, using highly decentralized air defense tactics. This makes a lot of sense because North Korea’s air defense system would not survive the first weeks, or even days, of a major air campaign. Youtube Screencap These vehicles and their missiles were interesting. They look like KN-02 short-range ballistic missiles, or an evolution of that system, but mounted two per vehicle instead of one. The carriage layout is similar to that of Russia’s Iskander tactical ballistic missile system . These smaller missiles don’t get the same hype as their larger cousins, but they will be the ones that rain down en masse on South Korea during a conflict, and will be used to strike targets beyond the range of North Korea’s traditional artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems arrayed along the DMZ. With this in mind, this could be a new system altogether which would be a troubling development. Youtube Screencap We know what the quartet of transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) shown above are meant for, the KN-15 solid-fueled medium-range ballistic missile. Having been tested successfully, this is one of North Korea’s most menacing ballistic missiles because it could be launched far faster than its liquid fueled cousins. The missile also shares wide commonality with North Korea’s KN-11 “Polaris” submarine-launched ballistic missile system. Youtube Screencap As usual, the missiles displayed grew in complexity and range as the parade moved forward. The next up was the HS-12 , North Korea’s most proven upper-tier ballistic missile system in terms of range. This is the same intermediate-range missile that North Korea launched over Japan twice last year, and threatened to use in a show of force off Guam. The missile is an outgrowth of the BM-25 Musudan missile that preceded it. For regional players, no other missile is a more realistic threat than the HS-12 at this time. Youtube Screencap Now we are getting into the heaviest hardware, the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The HS-14 , North Korea’s first ICBM that flew twice last July, made an appearance in the parade, but instead of being on a large TEL, the missiles were transported on the back of semi truck tractor-trailers. Youtube Screencap Now to the finale, and the system most analysts were waiting to see, the massive HS-15 . The ICBM was seen on its purpose-built nine axle TEL. There is no denying that the missile looked impressive as it was wheeled down the street, and it really does represent a new point in what has been a seemingly unbelievable arch in North Korean weapons development over the last two years. You probably want to know how many of these big missiles were shown at one time. Roughly six of each ballistic missile system were included in the parade—not an encouraging reality to ponder I know. But quantity really isn’t the most important thing to take away from this whole spectacle. The fact that North Korea has gone from showing off “paper” and “model” long-range missile systems—from questionable missile designs that have never flown and just big empty canisters mounted on TELs—to real systems that have flown, and all of them quite successfully by now, is what’s most important. And this brings us full circle to this being a smaller parade, not to mention the changing utility of these types of events for the Kim regime going forward. Fact: Kim Jong Un no longer has to scare us with hollow missiles riding atop trucks, he now has the real thing. In the future—outside of what could happen in the coming months militarily between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies—these parades will be more heavily weighted towards domestic consumption than to spook and confuse foreign populations and intelligence analysts. Kim changed the game two years ago by doing what is father never did, embracing the missile testing process, including its embarrassing failures. This was a phenomenon The War Zone pointed out and warned against early on in great detail. And when it comes to Kim’s missiles today—not to mention his nuclear program—the fact is the young tyrant has come through on nearly everything he bluntly said he would, and made intelligence agencies, politicians, and pundits look like fools in the process. The big takeaway here should be: “Underestimate the North Koreans at your own peril.” Sure the rhetoric is laughable at times, but this guy has played his missile and nuclear programs and ambitions incredibly straight to the world—including to his enemies. With this in mind, going forward we are far more likely to first see a new missile design on a launch pad than being paraded around Kim Il Sung Square in late Winter or early Spring. In other words, those big canisters riding on TELs for which North Korea had painted its dastardly hopes and dreams for so long are no longer needed, and that is a very scary thought indeed. It’s also worth noting that the four core missile systems shown during yesterday’s parade are likely the pared-down inventory that North Korea will continue to evolve and validate in the future. Instead of a new missile seemingly popping up every couple of months, development efforts will become more focused and refined on the systems that have already flown. The next big step for Kim’s missile programs will be to adapt the country’s budding solid fuel technology and advanced airframe design to larger missiles systems, which will be key in fielding a more credible and robust nuclear deterrent. This could happen in stages—literally—where existing liquid-fueled designs are upgraded with a single solid stage. One strange thing that stood out from the parade was the fact that there was no sign of a submarine-launched ballistic missile . We know that Pyongyang is moving ahead rapidly in an attempt to further develop that capability and field it in an operational form. This will be something to keep an eye out for in the months to come. That is if the military status quo lasts that long on the Korean Peninsula. There are concerning signs that point to the possibility of a limited strike by the U.S. on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs following the Olympics. This will probably be predicated on Kim’s own actions. If he and his villainous crew continue with high-profile tests of their long-range missile and nuclear systems, a rapid American military response is becoming increasingly likely . But regardless of potential conflicts to come, it is absolutely mind blowing what North Korea has accomplished in terms of its missile capabilities in just 24 months, and yesterday’s parade was excruciating evidence of this inconvenient reality.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",New “Digital Eye Piece” Will Allow U.S. Fighter Pilots To Own The Night Like Never Before,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Donning a helmet mounted display (HMD) or night vision goggles (NVGs) has been a far from seamless issue for American fighter pilots since the widespread introduction of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) well over a decade ago. Now that is changing via a fairly novel piece of technology that leverages existing cockpit HMD infrastructure and NVGs called the “Digital Eye Piece.” The USAF’s late adoption of helmet mounted display and sighting system technology is an interesting story in itself, one you can read about in this past feature of mine. Spurred by the introduction of the AIM-9X Sidewinder , which can engage targets far off the aircraft’s centerline axis, the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps has widely adopted JHMCS as their HMD solution. Every HMD has its positives and negatives, and JHMCS certainly has its drawbacks, but it has proven to be a highly successful and largely positively viewed enabling piece of fighter pilot garb. Now in its second major rendition, the HMD can also be found on allied tactical aircraft all over the world. The system uses a visor that attaches to the crown of a pilot’s helmet that projects critical flight data, weapons cueing and sensor symbology, as well as mission information generated from the aircraft’s mission sub-systems and data-links in front of the pilot’s right eye. The projection is reflected like a heads up display onto a piece of sapphire glass that is specially tailored to the contours of each pilot’s facial structure. The unit isn’t cheap, with each one costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Every JHMCS capable cockpit is magnetically mapped before the sensor tracking gear is installed, with magnetics being the system’s primary mode of spatial tracking. JHMCS and the modern HMD for fighter aircraft concept serve a number of functions. These include elevating the pilot’s overall situational awareness, enhancing their ability to keep their eyes “out of the cockpit,” and most importantly, giving the pilot the ability to target weapons and sensors simply by looking at said object or locale. Bottom line: HMDS offer a massive capabilities leap for tactical aircraft crews. While some HMDs have night vision capabilities built in, JHMCS which the DoD is heavily invested in, does not. What this has meant operationally is that once night falls, pilots forgo night vision or they swap out their JHMCS visor and all its features for a pair of night vision goggles (NVGs). In other words, either the pilot can have the HMD or NVGs, not both at one time. Israeli defense contractor Elbit and their partners in JHMCS American avionics giant Rockwell-Collins developed a novel workaround for this issue. The Digital Eye Piece (DEP) leverages JHMCS architecture already installed in many fighter cockpits and interfaces it with an eye piece that projects all the JHMCS symbology and information in front of the right eye of existing night vision goggle systems. Elbit During initial trials, Elbit describes their adaptation and pilots’ experiences with it as such in an official release: This unique add-on solution transforms existing HMDs and Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) into highly advanced, cutting-edge night vision smart helmets, providing pilots with daytime cueing and display capabilities in their night operations. Its seamless integration requires no changes to aircraft installation or software. The DEP is a simple and cost-effective plug-and-play solution that enables pilots to transition from day to night configuration, improves situational awareness and meets the operational needs of military aviators. DEP can be installed onboard any fielded JHMCS, D-JHMCS or JHMCS-II. The goal of the flights was to demonstrate the system’s performance in night flight, including A/A and A/G scenarios, in which effective flight missions generally cannot be executed. A variety of international Air Forces participated in flights onboard their F-16 aircraft. Feedback was very positive and the pilots emphasized the contribution of the system to night flight safety and effectiveness. Pilot feedback included: “the DEP improves situational awareness and reduces workload”… “the system improves night identification capabilities”… “the DEP provides more flexibility and better situational awareness for close air support”. Elbit Now the system is being fielded in large quantities to Air Force, Navy, and Marine fleet pilots and has already been used during combat operations in the Middle East. The 114th Fighter Wing, an Air National Guard unit flying Block 40 F-16CGs out of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, better known as the “Lobos,” was one of the latest units that put the system to the test. Major Jeremy Doohen, one of the wing’s pilots, stated the following about his experience with the new system: “With the U.S. being smart with their military tactics they look for opportunities where we can gain an advantage and a lot of times that’s at night… With this new system it allows our targeting cueing capabilities to be overlaid into our night vision goggles, before this, there were just night vision goggles… It doesn’t just turn night into day, it makes it a lot easier for you to pick out definition in the landscape and you can see a mountain… It gives us the ability to put our radar onto an aircraft or a target and have that overlay within our night vision goggles.. The technology is moving in the right direction so now we can say, ‘we can try that at night’ because now we have better capabilities at night… It’s exciting. It makes it that much easier for the pilot to accomplish the mission.” One of the Lobos’ F-16CGs getting some attention prior to a nighttime mission. Note the F-35-like “Have Glass II” paint that now adorns most of the squadron’s Vipers., USAF While the system doesn’t provide anywhere near the whiz-bang tech that the infamous F-35’s helmet does , which is deeply integrated into the jet’s design, adding a DEP that is built specifically for JHMCS equipped aircraft and can be slapped on existing NVGs, is a somewhat refreshing solution to a complex problem. It’s also one that likely costs far less than deploying a whole new helmet mounted display system and its required infrastructure altogether. A 114th Fighter Wing pilot tries on the DEP system. , USAF Going forward, American fighter pilots flying 4th generation fighters can feel confident that the long-established U.S. military adage “we own the night” still holds water, and the ability to kill your enemy simply by looking at them even after the sun goes down thanks to the DEP certainly supports that statement.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Flurry Of Aircraft Shoot-Downs And Counter-Strikes Erupt Across Israel And Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Information about an aerial battle over western Syria has been coming fast and furious in the overnight hours. Late Friday an Iranian drone crossed over the Golan Heights and entered into Israeli airspace. The aircraft was detected and shot down. In response to the incursion, Israel promptly launched a strike on the drone’s command vehicle and other components related to its operation. Another larger air raid was later executed by the IAF against various targets in Syria. During this operation an Israeli Air Force F-16I Sufa (“Storm”) was shot down. A video has been released showing the downing of the Iranian drone. It appears to be a flying-wing configuration. In particular, Iran has been working to build similar shaped unmanned aircraft as the stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel it captured in 2011, although these knock-off craft, which come in various sizes and configurations, are far less advanced than their American counterpart. The propeller-driven “Simorgh” variant of the design appears to best match the aircraft shown in the video being shot down, although the video is low quality so it’s hard to make the identification definitively. Iran has been working on creating a variety of RQ-170 shaped knock off drones of various sizes and capabilities. The propeller-driven variant on the right is most likely what was shot down., Youtube Screencap Notice that the Iranian drone appears to release decoy flares before being shot down by an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. This would indicate a fairly advanced system. The second part of the video shows the line-of-sight control vehicle for the drone being destroyed by an Israeli guided munition. Note that the weapon uses man-in-the-loop terminal guidance which is very popular with Israeli forces. You can read more about this concept of operations and these types of munitions here . The actual weapon used was not fired from an aerial platform, it was an IAI Harop “suicide” drone (seen it banner image at the top of this article). The War Zone did a full profile on this series of pioneering weapons you can read here. Following the initial counterstrike on the drone control unit, Israel launched a large-scale strike package against a dozen other targets in Syria, including four Iranian-related targets and three air defense batteries. It was during this raid that the F-16 was shot down. Both of the F-16I’s crew ejected from the stricken aircraft and were recovered by Black Hawk helicopter alive, but one has severe injuries and is being treated at Rambam Hospital. Reports state that various missiles were involved in the Syrian anti-air onslaught, in which between a dozen and two dozen SAMs were fired. Cold War vintage SA-5 Gammon and SA-3 Goa missiles are said to have been included in the salvo, both of which the Assad regime has many of and has fired repeatedly towards IAF aircraft during raids over the country that have taken place over the years, with the frequency of those strikes having increased dramatically in recent months . The SA-17 Grizzly road-mobile SAM system—a modernized version of the SA-11 Buk —is also said to have been involved. Regardless of the type of missile Syria used to down the F-16, this is the first time one had found its mark on an Israeli jet. With Syria’s air defense response being far more voluminous than seen in past IAF incursions into its airspace, air raid sirens were triggered around the Golan Heights in fear of the missiles or other errant anti-aircraft artillery projectiles landing in Israeli territory. The scale of the response and the loss of the F-16 could also point to the possibility that this was a planned operation on Syria’s behalf. Israeli F-16I like the one shot down., JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images Assad’s forces have executed bold, if not outright reckless and illogical maneuvers in other parts of Syria in recent days . The engagement also provides more evidence that Syria has upgraded their existing air defense capabilities and tied their air defense network in with Russia’s more advanced sensor network as we have reported on in the past. The possible involvement of an SA-17 is also interesting because this system is highly mobile, can be operated in a self-contained manner, and can “pop up” unexpectedly. This can leave nearby enemy aircraft vulnerable to ambush attacks even if they are benefitting from high-end mission planning, real-time electronic surveillance measures, suppression of enemy air defense support, and electronic warfare coverage. There have also been reports that Hezbollah has received SA-17s in recent years, which also lends credit to the possibility that this was a “baited” operation. All that is left of the F-16I shot down following a raid in Syria. , JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images Just hours after these events took place, another aircraft was shot down in the region, this time over the embattled Syrian province of Afrin. Turkey has launched an incursion into the area and there has been fierce fighting there in recent days. The helicopter in question was a T129 attack helicopter belonging to Turkey. Both its pilot and gunner were killed as a result of the engagement. Turkish President Recep Erdogan has remarked on the loss, stating that those who knocked it out of the sky will “pay a heavy price.” We will keep this post up to date throughout the day as more details become available. Update: 7:25am PST— Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi made the following farcical comment regarding the shoot-down of the Iranian drone: “Reports of downing an Iranian drone flying over Israel and also Iran’s involvement in attacking an Israeli jet are so ridiculous… Iran only provides military advice to Syria.” No less than two fairly advanced Iranian drones that were capable of firing weapons were downed by USAF F-15Es over southern Syria last year, not to mention Tehran supports a literal army of Shiite militia fighters that fight on behalf of Assad’s regime. Iran also has various military installations spread throughout Syria and has even launched ballistic missile attacks on opposition targets in the country. Tehran also uses the country as a conduit to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah. These transfers that have been the targets of Israeli airstrikes for years now, something Israel is now outright discussing after years of not commenting on the operations. Update: 9:20am PST— Al Arabiya is reporting that an Israeli F-15 was also hit in the SAM barrage, but that jet was able to make an emergency landing. Also it looks like IAF CH-53 Yasur was involved in the pilot rescue/emergency evacuation which isn’t surprising as combat search and rescue is one of the helicopter’s primary missions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 27, 2019",USAF’s Controversial New Plan To Retire B-2 And B-1 Bombers Early Is A Good One,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you are a military aviation aficionado, or even interested in military technology at all, the Air Force’s new plan to retire both the swing-wing B-1B “Bone” and the B-2A “Spirit” earlier than originally planned is probably going to be upsetting to some degree. Bombers in particular capture the public’s imagination and interest like no other combat aircraft—and everyone seems to have a favorite. But the harsh reality is that once the new B-21 Raider comes online in the next decade, there won’t be room for four bombers in the service’s portfolio, and quite honestly, there shouldn’t be room for three either. On February 11th, 2017 Aviation Week reported that the USAF has created an updated “bomber vector,” basically its future roadmap for its bomber platforms, which includes divesting both the B-1B and B-2A fleets fully by the mid 2030s. This development is especially eyebrow-raising for the B-2 community which was slated to serve into the second half of the century and continues to receive an array of upgrades that would supposedly allow it to do so effectively. The current B-52, B-1, B-2 bomber trio has served the USAF since 1997. , USAF These decisions orbit around what I believe is the most important program in the USAF’s portfolio at this time, the B-21 Raider. Although designated as a bomber, and certainly it will be able to perform those traditional missions, it really is a stealthy, high-flying, multi-mission and highly flexible platform that can reach out over long distances and touch the enemy without relying on nearby tanker support . It can also do so in some very dangerous neighborhoods and survive to do it again the next day. This aircraft will be absolutely critical to future combat operations in a wide variety of scenarios, but especially so for peer-state conflicts that the Pentagon and the Trump Administration have built their new defense strategy around. The USAF says it needs at least a fleet of 100 B-21s, but many within the service and external to it are calling for a much larger fleet than that. B-21 Raider concept art. , Northrop Grumman Under the USAF’s original plan, the flying force would hold onto the B-1B till 2040, and the B-52 to around that same timeframe, although the B-52’s future always seemed brighter than the B-1B’s which does not have a nuclear strike mission and is very expensive to operate and historically suffers chronically from low availability (more on that in a moment). The B-2 was supposed to soldier on till 2058 and would operate alongside the B-21 for decades. Under the new plan, the B-2 would be retired first, no later than 2032—over a decade and a half sooner than in the previous roadmap. The B-1 would be put out to pasture not long after, with it leaving the service no later than 2036. Tyler Rogoway/Author Currently there are 20 B-2s in service, with just a handful of them being mission ready at any given time. There are 60 B-1Bs in the USAF’s portfolio. Assuming the B-21 goes into production sometime in the mid 2020s, it would likely replace these aircraft on a one-to-one basis, with at least 80 B-21s being operational by the time the B-1B and B-2A communities had shuttered their doors sometime in 2036. The plan leaves the USAF’s fleet of 75 B-52H untouched through the 2050s, with a real possibility that the venerable bomber would reach its 100th birthday while still in service. Overall, the roadmap points to a total force of 175 heavy bombers by the 2040s, made up of B-52s and B-21s exclusively. Axing the B-2 fleet so early may seem like a severe move, but with a fleet of just 20 aircraft, the type is a “silver bullet” capability that is hideously expensive to operate and ever more challenging to support. Still, the aircraft has provided an incredible capability that no other power on earth has for over two decades, and has proven itself hugely effective time and time again. Tyler Rogoway/Author At the same time we have also become very accustomed to viewing the B-2 fleet as an indispensable and rare national treasure that is absolutely worth the cost of sustaining as no other aircraft can do what it can. But once the B-21 is on the ramp that will no longer be the case. And considering that Northrop Grumman is getting the chance to build a B-2 “2.0” of sorts, with all that they have learned from building and supporting the B-2 since its first flight nearly three decades ago, the B-21 is set to leapfrog the B-2 in terms of raw capability. In other words, in the B-21 the USAF gets greater density and enhanced capability, making the case for supporting the B-2 far less salient than it ever has been in the past. Additionally, the B-21 will be able to benefit from the outgoing B-2’s braintrust and even its infrastructure to some degree. The B-1B has turned out to be a very capable and flexible asset, but the aircraft has always struggled to find its place within the USAF’s bomber hierarchy. When its nuclear mission was stripped in the 1990s, the big charismatic jet’s future was in doubt. It eventually found success as a tactical bomber during the Global War on Terror, and the addition of the Sniper targeting pod to its avionics suite allowed it to provide close air support in a new and exciting manner. But those abilities and other conventional duties are unlikely to make the B-1B more relevant in an Air Force that has to set priorities to support a new national defense strategy. The B-1B and its capability-expanding Sniper targeting pod. , Tyler Rogoway/Author The idea of fielding a bomber inventory of over 250 aircraft made of up four separate types would mean the support footprint for America’s bomber force would have to be expanded massively, and the cost of operating such a diverse fleet simply isn’t sustainable. Under this new plan, the bomber force would still grow from 157 aircraft to 175—and maybe even larger if more than 100 B-21s are procured—but that is a far more manageable proposition considering the fleet is going from three types to just two. There is no doubt about it, it will be hard to see the B-2 and the B-1 go. But doing so would accomplish three very important things. First off, it would go a long way to protect the B-21 Raider program and ensure that at least 100 aircraft are fielded. The USAF’s track record with fielding bombers since the B-52 is abysmal, and the B-2 serves as a warning of how a Pentagon death spiral can end up manifesting itself in the worst kind of ways. Most indications are that the B-21 program is proceeding well and on budget , but considering it remains largely cloaked in a veil of secrecy , we can’t know for certain the exact details of its progress or fiscal stability. But regardless, the USAF needs this aircraft for the threats it will face in the future, more so than other high-profile aircraft programs. So setting a plan now that is realistic as to how the aircraft will be funded and sustained once airframes are delivered is essential to seeing it through to fruition. Tyler Rogoway/Author Second, this plan will open up funds for the B-52H to get some serious upgrades, most important of which are brand new engines that will not only make the jet more reliable and economical to fly, but will also unlock new payload, range, and airfield performance potential. Paired with a new AESA radar and the upcoming long-range standoff (LRSO) stealthy cruise missile that will probably end up having a conventional capability as well as a nuclear one, the BUFF will remain an incredibly flexible weapons truck for decades to come. Other upgrades to the Cold War era bomber could include lasers and active missile defense systems that would allow the type to survive along the outer edges of contested combat environments. Maybe it will even get a stand-off jamming payload like the one that has been floated for decades. Such a capability could greatly assist in its B-21 brethren’s penetrating attack and surveillance missions. Finally, it would mean the B-21 would get a nuclear capability without delay, taking over the penetrating nuclear strike role from the B-2A. The early adoption of the nuclear mission and even unmanned operations by the B-21 is something The War Zone discovered previously in official USAF documents. This roadmap also vibes with the Pentagon’s new nuclear posture review , which calls for more nuclear delivery options than are currently available. Paired with the new B61-12 nuclear bomb, a large fleet of B-21s could put many targets at risk during a single sortie in a flexible and recallable fashion. USAF Beyond these three major points, this new “bomber vector” clearly takes into account the metrics behind operating each bomber currently in the USAF’s inventory. According to the Air Force Magazine , the maintenance hours per flying hour for the three current bombers in the fleet are: 74 hours for the B-1B, 45 hours for the B-2A, but that doesn’t count the time it takes to keep up its low-observable skin, so it is much higher in reality. 62 hours for the B-52H But what’s most telling are the availability (aircraft can fly) and mission capable rates (aircraft can fly with all combat systems functional) of each platform, with the oldest of the lot far outperforming its peers: B-52H averaged an availability rate of 80 percent over the last five years. B-1B and B-2A averaged about 50 percent availability. B-1B averaged about 40 percent mission capable rate. B-2A averaged about 35 percent mission capable rate. B-52H averaged 60 percent mission capable rate. Cost per flying hour for each type are: B-1B and B-52H averaged around $70k per hour B-2 averaged between $110k-150k per hour and is one of the USAF’s most expensive aircraft to operate The choice between the B-52H and the B-1B based just on these basic metrics alone is fairly clear, not to mention the B-52’s potential for bettering its numbers significantly with new engines and other smaller upgrades. It is hard to fault the B-2 for its low numbers because it is such a small community airframe-wise and the jets were so cutting edge at the time of production— nobody had ever built a stealth bomber before. But still, the numbers are the numbers, and the B-2 is poor performer based on these critical metrics. Tyler Rogoway/Author The B-21’s core design initiative has centered on the use mature and semi-mature components and subsystems not only to lower risk and to decrease development time and costs, but also to better ensure support for the aircraft over time. Although many look to history to predict the future as to the B-21’s success, there has never been a program that was so tailored to avoid its progenitor’s fate. Even how the program is being run and by what office are different than traditional procurement methods, as is the fact that its requirements were frozen nearly half a decade ago to avoid mission creep and expensive late-change orders. Such an order changed the B-2’s design drastically far along in its development and greatly increased its price tag, all for a capability that has never been used (you can read more about this here ). Basically the whole B-21 effort is focused on doing anything possible to meet targeted requirements and costs so as to not relive the B-2’s horrific procurement past. None of this guarantees the program outright success, but it is a good set of circumstances to realize it down the road. Tyler Rogoway/Author So yes, this is bittersweet news superficially speaking, but it’s also very important news when it comes to making sure the B-21 program meets its production goals. If the USAF would have attempted to go for a single high-end solution, having B-21s replace the entire bomber fleet, that would have been a terrible, albeit alarmingly typical move. Instead they chose the best options for a high-low bomber strategy mix, and that should be commended. And yes, the big caveat here it that the B-21 will have to perform effectively before the B-2 fleet and even the B-1 fleet draws down, but even if there are developmental hurdles, there is nothing stopping these dates from being moved left or right on the timeline a bit, and I am sure the USAF will say just that. Tyler Rogoway/Author In the end, the USAF has to sacrifice some legendary airframes, but at the same time it finally gets the stealth bomber fleet it was promised—and it will come in a much more mature, reliable, and more capable package than it would have 30 years ago. Maybe just as important, the B-52H, which has proven to be such an iconic workhorse, gets to become the best aircraft it can be. But above all else, this is actually a rational plan from an Air Force that has proven to be totally irrational over the last decade or so, and serves as a great sign that tough but logical decisions can actually be made from USAF brass once again. Expect a big B-21 public relations push following the release of this plan, which should happen officially today along with the 2019 budget. Hopefully we may even get our first sight of the Raider sometime soon.

Last November, The War Zone posted an exclusive story detailing a bizarre incident involving an unidentified aircraft that transited the skies of the Pacific Northwest in the early evening of October 25th, 2017. What started as a radar target moving at very high speed over Northern California turned into a series of eyewitness accounts made by nearby airline pilots traveling northward over Oregon. Even F-15 fighters were launched to intercept the mysterious intruder that quickly became invisible to radar. Now, through the Freedom of Information Act, we present what could be one of the most insightful instances of official documentation surrounding such an encounter that had already been confirmed to have occurred by both the FAA and the USAF. These materials include fascinating audio recordings of radio transmissions and phone calls made as the incident was unfolding, as well as pilot interviews, and conversations between FAA officials made in the aftermath of the highly peculiar incident. For proper context, make sure to first read our original post linked here detailing the event, how our report came to be in the first place, as well as the rare confirmations as to its authenticity from both the FAA and the USAF. Below is also a short explainer video that will give you a basic overview of the incident. Fast forward three months later, and now we have so much more evidence that adds incredible depth and color to our original report and the limited radio recordings we originally had to go off of. Via our Freedom of Information Act Request we received hours of audio, all with unique elements that add to this story. What we have done is packaged that audio, as well as the radar data provided, into four separate videos. We will highlight some of the big takeaways from each video in our piece, but we cannot stress enough how interesting and eye opening this audio is to listen to in full, so we highly recommend you do so by watching each video in its entirety. The first video includes audio from the initial spotting of the object as it ripped its way across Northern California at high speed, before it took a turn north and merged with nearby air traffic and disappeared from radar. Once again, beyond becoming invisible to radar, this aircraft had no transponder broadcasting nor did it ever communicate verbally with air traffic controllers. The audio in the video goes on to be sync’d in real-time with radar data obtained via our FOIA request. Oakland Center Sector 31 first detected the target around 4:30pm PST. Below is a chart showing where Oakland Center’s high altitude sectors are situated around Northern California. Sector 31 spans roughly from Sacramento up towards Redding, before its northern edge, which is near the border with Oregon, terminates and Seattle Center’s airspace begins. To the east, the airspace sits along the California-Nevada border. This makes sense as the craft was eventually tracked by airline pilots as it made its way up over Crater Lake and towards the Willamette Valley. In the audio the Oakland Center controller notes that it is near his boundary, so it seems the aircraft’s first appearance officially occurred near the border of Oakland Center Sector 31 and Seattle Center Sector 13 or 14. The target was moving “very fast at 37,000” feet when it was first detected. FAA Seattle Center high altitude sector chart. , Seattle ARTCC The “intruder” quickly dropped off radar and that’s when the visual sightings made by airline crews began. They continued for roughly half an hour and over hundreds of miles. The exchanges between nearby pilots and air traffic control regarding the unidentified aircraft were constant in the audio, with the same description coming back time and again—that of a white aircraft cruising at around 37,000 feet that is too far away to tell the type or if it has markings of any kind on it. At roughly 27:30 into the video we get our first indication that the F-15s out of PDX are about to scramble, with the air traffic controller noting this while talking to another FAA controller, during which the controller also reiterates that there has still been no radar contact with the aircraft. The controller also repeatedly asks aircrews nearby to check their Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) for the aircraft, which all come back negative. F-15s of the 142nd Fighter Wing taxi out for departure from their nest at PDX., Tyler Rogoway/Author The F-15s first appear on radar as they climb out of Portland to the south at time index 33:33 as “Rock” flight—a common callsign used for the alert F-15s stationed at PDX. Alaska 439 asks for an update on the unidentified aircraft and the controller notes they still have nothing on him, saying colloquially that it must be in a kind of “stealth mode or something.” It’s also interesting that the F-15s first went south when it seems as if the object would have been north of PDX by the time they finally launched. This second video is just the radar data in its raw form. It starts before the sync’d recording begins above so we thought we would post it in full so our readers can take a closer look if they want. Next we move into some very interesting recordings of FAA phone calls that occurred as all of this was taking place. We edited out dead space in the audio between phone calls and bleeped the names of those who named themselves. Aside from that, the audio is unedited by us, although we cannot be certain if parts were redacted by the FAA or not. There were a few strange areas where conversations went mute and it’s not clear if this was edited or just an anomaly. The primary person talking in most of these calls is the Operations Manager In Charge for Seattle Center at the time that the incident took place. The first call is to Oakland Center, and it occurs early on after the initial radar detection and as pilots began spotting the craft visually. He also mentions that “air defense” is looking for the target now too (on radar), so it shows how early the military was involved in the encounter. You will notice that the term “DEN” is referred to repeatedly in these recordings. That is the Domestic Events Network, a sort of hotline system that is used to bridge the FAA with federal authorities, namely the military, during a number of circumstances which you can read about here . You will also hear the term “WADS” and the nickname/callsign “Bigfoot.” This refers to the Western Air Defense sector of NORAD that monitors the airspace over a huge swath of territory in the United States and Canada. Based out of McChord AFB in Washington, WADS scrambles the fighters when needed and works to direct them to their targets of interest during domestic air sovereignty missions, among other responsibilities. USAF When the Manager In Charge is asked if he was asking for military assistance by another FAA controller, the tape goes blank. The same inquiry is heard moments later, and it goes silent again before another call begins. Although it really doesn’t have much impact on the greater mystery, who asked for the F-15s to scramble and when, comes up in the next video in an exchange between the same manager and an FAA official. In the final set of calls in the video we hear controllers talking about how the Air Force wants to set up an air patrol over Battle Ground, Washington, which is a dozen miles directly north of PDX. We know the F-15s headed south initially, so it isn’t clear if this call came after they initially headed in that direction or before they were even airborne and the plan changed later on for some reason. Once again “Rock” refers to the callsign of the alert fighters. Finally, we get to our last and most interesting of our evidence videos. It contains the calls made after the incident occurred. Seattle Center’s Manager In Charge of Operations tries to figure out what happened exactly. In doing so he talks once again with Seattle Center and the trio of airline pilots that spotted the craft visually and has some very interesting conversations with the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization Security office and the agency’s Safety and Quality Assurance Group. First we hear about the big question as to who “requested” the scramble, as according to the call, it has to come from FAA headquarters. The manager floats the idea, in retrospect, of having the airliners keep a visual on the craft instead of allowing them to descending into PDX, at least until the F-15s show up, but the FAA official swats that down as they didn’t know what the aircraft was, “if they are equipped with anything” or its intentions. She reiterates that getting the military involved was a good idea but that it should have come from FAA headquarters over the DEN. The manager reminds her again that he doesn’t know who requested military assistance and that Oakland Center told him to call WADS initially. Next we hear from Oakland Center again, at first discussing who ordered the scramble, but then the conversation goes into talking about what actually happened. Both agree that there was “definitely something out there” with the Oakland Center controller saying the aircraft first appeared going southbound at high speed before executing an abrupt maneuver and then “took off northbound.” Even figuring out how to report the encounter seems totally foreign to both higher ranking controllers, with one stating “I have a feeling someone is going to go through this with a fine-tooth comb.” An F-15C from the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of PDX just after sunset. , Tyler Rogoway/Author Then we get into the pilot interviews over the phone, with the manager’s intention being for each crew to write up a report detailing their individual perspective of the incident. During the call with United 612 there are some odd dropped moments, but the pilot describes the encounter, stating that he was too far away to make out the type. The next call, with Alaska Airlines 525, also doesn’t reveal much as the crew says they never were able to see it, but the crew of Skywest 3478 did, although he didn’t have much to add. The call with the pilot of Southwest 4712 was by far the most interesting. He immediately notes how strange the encounter was and how he has never seen an incident like it in nearly 30 years of flying jets. The pilot noted, “if it was like a Lear (private jet) type airframe I probably would not have seen it this clear. This was a white airplane and it was big . And it was moving at a clip too, because we were keeping pace with it, it was probably moving faster than we were… It was a larger aircraft yeah.” He also said they watched the object from Northern California all the way to their descent into Portland. A 737 about to land on runway 28L at Portland International., Tyler Rogoway/Author The manager’s final call, was with the FAA’s Quality Assurance Group, who is taken by surprise by the details surrounding the event, and especially with the fact that nobody still knew what the aircraft was or where it ended up. “Wow that’s weird” is the operative quote by the FAA official, which is insightful to say the least as these people deal with unique incidents that occur in American airspace on a daily basis. The manager agreed with the sentiment and noted that it wasn’t some small aircraft and it was moving fast, outpacing a 737 cruising nearby. The official also says that the incident should be classified as “potentially significant” on reporting documents. She even said that this was “a weird enough thing that there is not a set procedure… It’s not often we hear about an unknown guy up at that altitude.” Collectively these materials give us incredible insight not only into this incident, but also into how such an event is actually handled in real-time by those who are responsible for the safety of those in the air and those on ground below. What they don’t offer is any sort of an explanation for what happened on that fall evening. But really, the fact that all those involved, from air traffic controllers, to Air Force radar operators, to airline pilots, and even special FAA officials tasked with responding to all types of out of the ordinary incidents that occur in the sky on a daily basis seem just as puzzled with this event as we are makes the story all that much more intriguing. Above all else, this new evidence underscores just how rare these events actually are, especially ones that include multiple sightings, the use of multiple sensors, the involvement of various agencies including the military, and some of the most capable air-to-air fighters in the world. And after recent reports unmasking how the Pentagon remains highly interested in encounters just like this one, it holds even more weight than it did three months ago. We will continue to investigate this bizarre incident and we will keep you updated as to what else we discover.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Time For An Armed “School Marshal” Program To Deter And Counter Active Shooter Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This site is about national security, military strategy and defense technology, as well as the policy issues related to those topics. Rarely do have much of anything to say about domestic issues and the politics that goes along with them. But in certain circumstances, we have an obligation to take on domestic topics that relate to the things we talk about on a daily basis, most of which regular people know or think little about. And considering the site is called The War Zone, when our schools are being turned into just that on a regular basis, this becomes an ideal platform to discuss potential countermeasures to stop such horrific acts from happening. And it just so happens I am very passionate about one such concept. School shootings are this country’s national disgrace, period . They reflect a lack of investment in our youth—and that doesn’t necessarily mean monetary—and a culture that is failing its most treasured citizens and squandering its most precious resource without taking any meaningful corrective action. We have touched on elements of great gun debate before, but this piece has nothing to do with that. Solving this problem in the long run will take a cocktail of actions and policies—there is no single act alone that will ensure it never happens again in one form or another. But there is something we can do in the near term that would drastically deter future assailants and limit the severity of their unthinkable acts. And maybe most importantly, it will allow our kids to stop thinking of themselves as sitting ducks as they go about their already challenging lives. Once again, this piece is not about the Second Amendment or a position paper on what gun regulations should be enhanced, created, or eliminated. I just want to provide a way to allow our children to feel safe in their classrooms once again and to deny these inhuman monsters the opportunity to turn classrooms into shooting galleries. We need to work immediately at fielding well armed and well trained “School Marshals” in our public schools that are proficient in close quarters battle and counter-assault tactics as part of a new and enduring school security program. Luckily, many decorated soldiers have returned home with incredible combat experience, are already proficient in this demanding mission set, and have proven themselves to be highly disciplined and effective under fire while in combat. These protectors would be regularly trained, tested and evaluated to keep their vaunted position as guardians of our children. We must come to terms with the fact that there is no door system or passive security measure that will stop a suicidal shooter. Only having a dedicated operator on site, or even perceived to be on site, will stop this from happening or at least keep any incidents that do still occur from being so terribly destructive. It’s very odd that we already do this to secure our air travel system that already has multiple screening services and layers of security, but we leave our schools totally unsecured. Somehow deranged 18 year olds with rifles are less of a threat to public safety than a Saudi terrorist with a box cutter? It makes no sense. Although there are similarities between the Air Marshal program and what is being proposed, they are really very different other ways, most notably the School Marshal program would have a far more persistent presence in schools and would not suffer from the harsh traveling demands of the Air Marshal program. , Mike Stocker/Sun Sentinel/TNS via Getty Image And unlike international terrorists, one point that nobody seems to talk about is that almost all these diabolic fools who shoot-up schools have one thing in common: they do not want to fight another gunmen even though they are in most cases already on a “one way trip.” Almost every one of these assailants has either popped themselves before SWAT/SERT entered the facility to neutralize them or they are taken into custody without a gunfight. This is a critical factor that needs to be exploited. Something about their thought process does not want a fair fight. It’s all about exerting their “power” over innocents in an act of abstract revenge, not about going down in a blaze of demented glory. With this in mind, the most logical countermeasure becomes glaringly clear—harden the target with actual security personnel that are there just to protect innocent life alone from the criminally insane. School Marshals would not be School Resource Police Officers, they are not there to discipline kids, keep them off drugs, or watch for petty infractions. They are there to vigilantly protect the herd and are willing and able to give their life doing just that. They can also help liaison with local police to come up with the best plans for better preventing attacks and responding to them once they occur. If School Marshals were fielded as described, many of these shooters will simply stop showing up. The perverted attraction of the act is lost. And once again, this is not my opinion. It is a wildly peculiar commonality among these maniacs that validates this rationale. As for those that say they don’t want “soldiers” walking around their schools, one has to ponder what world are they living in? Our youth now train for active shooters just as they do for a common fire. They know they are sitting ducks that will have to wait till police arrive to hunt down the shooter. Considering the amount of destruction one individual can do in a short time against a defenseless and highly concentrated group of people, it is basically a roll of the dice as to if you survive or not. People complain that they don’t want to “militarize” their schools, or have “soldiers” walking around the halls, but that simply would not be the case with a School Marshal program. And even that is better than having many fatigue-clad soldiers showing up to the school after the unthinkable has already happened. , John McCall/Sun Sentinel/TNS via Getty Images And the “optics” argument against School Marshals is really irrelevant as they don’t have to look like a SWAT team member or a soldier when on duty. Every time you see the President move around he is surrounded by guards outfitted with automatic personal defense weapons that can pierce body armor. You don’t see these weapons because they can be concealed under a sport coat . In other words, a school resource officer is brandishing more weaponry than a School Marshal would in practice. During a time of heightened security, they can outfit themselves more elaborately in a uniformed manner. And who would complain about that? A police officer would look no more intimidating in this day and age. Even some of the toughest gun measures being pushed in Congress would not have stopped the majority of school shootings, but a well paid, well-trained, decorated ex-US Army Ranger or Marine with a personal defense weapon hidden under his or her jacket could. Sure, such a proposal is not a cheap ask, but we have spent trillions fighting terrorism in debatable wars overseas and have spent hundreds of billions on building others nation’ armies and security forces, yet the worst kind of terrorism is happening right here at home on a regular basis, and to the people we supposedly care about and protect the most. There are roughly 100,000 K-12 public schools in the United States. Considering that every school is different with different needs, and that most operate nine months out of the year, fielding 50,000 agents to cover our schools would seem acceptable. Put the cost of each agent and their training at $125,000 per year for estimations sake. That equates to $6.25B per year. That is less than ONE PERCENT of the 2019 defense budget. In other terms, that is half the cost on one aircraft carrier or roughly seven percent of the 2019 budget for the wars in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq. Considering that terror and death are happening to our own citizens more frequently in our own schools than overseas, this seems like an uncannily logical investment. It would also provide incredible jobs, maybe some of the most revered in our country and in law enforcement, for the cream of the crop of America’s veterans. You can scale up or down these numbers as you like, but the bottom line is that executing a program like this isn’t going to break the federal government’s budget. It’s well past time that we as a country stop waiting for a magic policy to fix this issue and start fighting back actively against this scourge. Every day we just sit and shrug while our kids go to school worrying if today is the day they will be mowed down by some disgruntled classmate. Once we have begun to secure our schools, actually debating gun regulations, America’s culture of violence, our troubled public school system and the inability for the mentally ill among us to get the health care they so desperately need will become more feasible. As for President Trump, who brands himself as champion of the Second Amendment and the figurehead of his America first strategy, School Marshals are something he can support without blowback from his base, and something he can do right now to show that we aren’t going to accept the miserable status quo on this issue. Donald Trump spoke shortly after the tragic events in Parkland, Florida but offered up no solutions or policies that could impact the school shooting epidemic the country faces. School Marshals is something that fits his general set of political stances and could have real impact the frequency and severity of active shooter attacks., AP To those who say, “I don’t know if this is the solution,” I say, then what is? This has been going on regularly for nearly two decades without any solutions being put into play, and the problem is getting worse. Waiting for some magical shift in societal norms, political will, and American culture that will put an end to this issue is irresponsible as it is naive, especially seeing as people continue to die en masse from it. Thanks for listening, and just like you, I feel so terribly sad for those in Parkland who lost their children, parents, teachers and friends to this terrible cancer in our society. The kids and faculty at that school seem so awesome, it literally couldn’t have happened to nicer people. But no more, we can and must to do better, and just hoping the problem with go away is the height of stupidity and ignorance. Demand the establishment a well-funded School Marshal program.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",GE Really Wants To Sell You A 30mm Cannon Pod In this Classic Marketing Reel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Marketing reels for Cold War era weapons systems are incredibly entertaining to watch. It’s a little Madison Avenue, a little Hollywood, a little Pentagon E-ring, and a bit of Sham-Wow guy thrown in for good measure. This was a time before powerpoint, and print could only tell so much of the story, so contractors poured good money into these films even for smaller ancillary systems. And the best reels have a good pitch man, whether it be General Chuck Yeager , or in the case of the GPU-5 gun pod, a serious and clearly spoken fighter pilot-like dude that uses overtly clear hand gestures named Frank Adamski from GE’s Defense Systems Division. The GPU-5, which contained a GAU-13 cannon—a truncated version of the A-10 Warthog’s massive GAU-8 Avenger cannon—has an interesting history. At one time it was used in an attempt to replace the A-10 with F-16s—an effort that failed for a number of reasons, including shaking the poor “electric jets” violently during firing. You can read all about this past saga in this previous feature of mine, in it I wrote: “During what would be a turning point in the way the world looks at air power, the F/A-16s set out to prove their worth. The idea was to unleash continuous streams of precision fire from their big 30mm gun pods onto Saddam’s armor and material and to finally prove that the faster, shorter legged and more nimble F-16 could indeed become a low-level gunfighter like the A-10. The results were less than desirable. In fact, they were horrible. Within the first 48 hours of continuous combat operations the GEPOD30s were proven to be totally unable to satisfy their intended mission. Precision fire was almost impossible with the setup as the F-16s software had not been adequately modified for aiming, and the vibration was so bad when the gun was fired that software tweaks probably would have made little difference anyway and it wreaked havoc on the F-16’s sensitive electronics and mechanical components. The reality is that the system was so ill-suited to the aircraft that just firing the gun multiple times would tweak the pylon it is attached to and thus it would become skewed far off zero. Not to mention that in comparison to the low and slower flying A-10, in actual combat the F-16’s high speed made it hard to get a proper sight picture to aim during long strafing runs. Apparently maintainers and pilots had warned that the gun was ill-suited for the light fighter long before the deployment, but their mission was to try and make it work. After the first few mission evolutions during the opening of Desert Storm, it was clear that the GPU-5 was an area suppression weapon at best, and the 174th unbolted the heavy gun pods from their jet’s and went back to using cluster and general purpose bombs on targets. A practice they would continue to practice as they patrolled their kill boxes throughout the war.” Although it wasn’t that successful, the pod was something of technological marvel, especially when it comes to how its big, coke bottle-sized 30mm ammunition was stored. A helical magazine surrounded the gun itself, holding 353 rounds of ammunition—good for 10 one second bursts according to our pitchman Frank. The gun’s drive system ran on compressed air stored in a composite 3200psi air bottle. The whole thing was ungainly yet at the same time amazingly compact. https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0EfGU2MvV8 “The GPU-5/A: Hight tech simplicity… To strike and survive!” Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 29, 2019",One Of These Five Ships Will Become The U.S. Navy’s Next Frigate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy has moved forward with funding five potential designs that could fulfill its future guided missile frigate FFG(X) requirement. At least 20 of these vessels will be built, and as we have discussed in detail before , the project is among the Navy’s most important initiatives. Fielding a highly capable surface combatant that can pick up many missions currently being conducted by over-tasked and far more expensive destroyers will be essential to providing a more flexible and sustainable fleet in the decades to come. The $15M contracts were awarded to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, Fincantieri Marine, Huntington Ingalls, Austal USA, and Lockheed Martin. The last two vendors currently build Littoral Combat Ships—the monohull Freedom class and the Independence class trimaran—for the U.S. Navy and both of their FFG(X) designs are based on those existing LCS platforms. Huntington Ingalls will put forward a version of their Patrol Frigate concept based off the Coast Guard’s Legend class National Security Cutter. Fincentieri Marine’s design is based on the the Italian Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM) frigate. General Dynamics Bath Iron Works is proposing a modified variant of the F100 frigate, a Spanish design that is also in service with the Australian Navy. Spanish F100 frigate alongside an US Arleigh Burke class destroyer. , USN All five entrants are based on mature platforms that already exist in one fashion or another. This lowers risk, development time, and cost. It’s worth noting that some entrants are already closer in form to the Navy’s requirements than others. Of the five being put forward, Bath Iron Works F100 class derivative—a ship that was already built for an Aegis system—seems to match the requirements very closely without major design revisions. It also helps that two close U.S. allies are already operating the type in separate configurations. Its elevated superstructure design also provides enhanced line-of-sight for its phased arrays radars, something the other competitors may have trouble integrating into their existing designs. Austal’s FFG(X) design is based on their Independence class Littoral Combat Ship., Austal USA The plan is that the Navy will evaluate each design as it matures and will understand the various options each vendor proposes with their entrant and the projected costs that go along with them. Finalized proposals will be submitted in 2019 with a single-source contract being awarded in 2020. General Dynamics Huntington Ingalls is basing their FFG(X) on their Patrol Frigate concept which is based on the Legend class cutter. You can see some of their past iterations on the design in this video . , Huntington Ingalls The Navy is willing to spend roughly $1B per ship, which should buy a very capable surface combatant. You can read all about this and the requirements set by the Navy for the FFG(X) in this past article. Fincantieri Marine FREMM Frigate., Fabius1975/wikicommons It is worth noting that one contender was left out of this phase of the program, the U.S.-German consortium made up of Atlas USA and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. ThyssenKrupp is a key contractor on Germany’s abortive Type 125 frigates that the German Navy decided to reject due to a slew of issues. Weeks after we initially reported on the blunder the story made international headlines. It’s not clear if the debacle had anything to do with the Navy leaving the team out of the FFG(X) tender. Being able to produce a frigate with minimal developmental and construction hiccups will be essential for fielding the first vessels by 2025. Lockheed’s FFG(X) concept based on the Freedom class LCS. Note the redesigned superstructure to accommodate phases array radars. , Lockheed Martin As far as reforming one of the existing Littoral Combat Ship designs or the FFG(X) role, both Lockheed and Austal have high hopes that they can keep their LCS production lines open with FFG(X)s, especially seeing that the LCS production program was curtailed after a dismal record of meeting its goals. Lockheed’s Freedom class design may have a leg up on Austal’s Independence class for the FFG(X) bid as Saudi Arabia is ordering a variant of the design that has a lot in common with the Navy’s FFG(X) requirements—especially in the anti-air warfare capability department. This could offset developmental costs for the Navy to some degree, although the idea of sticking with the LCS jet boat concept—which is largely regarded as vulnerable to battle damage—in an even more bloated form may be a path the Navy avoids regardless of synergies in development costs and commonality. There is no doubt that this is an exciting time for many of us who have pled for the Navy to field a proper frigate for years. With this in mind, the final 2019 selection can’t come soon enough.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",This Giant B-2 Replica Is How Airmen Train To Load Weapons Onto A Stealth Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-2 Spirit can pack one hell of a punch . In addition to B-61 and B-83 nuclear bombs, it can carry as many as 80 independently targetable 500lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions or a pair of 33,000lb GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators , and a ton of other weapon types as well. When the B-2 goes on an actual mission, it usually carries a big load, and often times it lugs that load halfway around the world. Suffice it to say, loading up the jet safely and accurately with all those explosives is a serious task that requires constant training, especially considering that a nick to the stealth bomber’s delicate radar absorbent skin can end a critical mission before it even starts. This is where Whiteman Air Force Base’s one-of-a-kind B-2 Weapons Load Trainer comes into play. The 67 foot long, 48 foot wide, 18 foot high replica of a B-2’s center fuselage weighs in at 80,000 pounds. It was built by Lockheed and Hughes back in 1993 to support the B-2 program that was still nearly a half decade away from becoming operational at the time. The contraption is used to train and certify Aircraft Armament Systems Specialists, also known as “Ordies,” to load various weapons into the B-2’s two cavernous weapons bays. Those bays work with the B-2’s actual smart bomb racks and rotary launchers, as well as the weapons lift trailer that conveys them. The 509th Maintenance Group trains airmen three shifts each day of the work week using the system, and it is especially handy for familiarizing novice airmen with the ins and outs of loading weapons onto America’s most prized air combat asset. The tolerances can be very tight, with just two inches of clearance in some circumstances, and the checklists to follow and attention to detail required to make sure the weapons will drop as promised can be exhaustive. There are also some unique issues for Ordies to contend with when it comes to servicing the B-2, like the jet’s sharp sawtooth edges on its weapons bay doors and access ports—something you don’t want to ram your forehead into. And it can be very dark under its umbrella-like charcoal gray fuselage. The munitions themselves aren’t cheap either. A JDAM costs around $20,000. A stealthy Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) can run upwards of three quarters of a million bucks. USAF Although publicly there isn’t any mention of using the trainer for practicing nuclear weapons loading and to certify ground crews to do so, we can assume this is a major mission of the huge training aid as well. Nuclear weapons have their own set of requirements when it comes to conveying them to an aircraft and mounting them, including a bunch of security protocols such as manipulating the Permissive Action Links (PAL) that arm the weapon for use and select its desired yield. It’s worth noting that in the top picture, a B-83 nuclear bomb’s form factor is shown in front of the B-2 Weapons Load Trainer. Having a full size device like this also allows the tiny fleet of B-2s—just 20 in the inventory, a fraction of which are mission ready at any given time—to operate without being hampered by weapons load training needs. USAF Other aircraft communities use derelict airframes and other setups for similar purposes, but the B-2’s system is the most elaborate purpose-built device of its kind in the USAF’s inventory. Other systems like it are catching on though, especially as expensive stealth fighters continue to fill-out the USAF’s inventory. Eglin AFB has a similar system for the F-35 , although it isn’t nearly as imposing. USAF With the B-2 slated to be in the inventory for another 15 years , the big device will continue to get a lot of use, and it’s very likely that a similar system will take its place in the shape and configuration of the upcoming B-21 Raider. Still, by almost every indication the B-21 won’t be able to carry as much weapons tonnage as its forbearer B-2. So there you have it, the B-2 Weapons Load Trainer. It takes its place alongside the Navy’s USS CALASSES carrier mockup as one of the military’s largest and most exotic training aids.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President’s Trump’s visit to Davos, Switzerland for the 2018 World Economic Forum made headlines for a bunch of reasons, but for us defense and aviation geeks, it offered an incredible setting to see Marine One in action, and video and images from the President’s visit didn’t disappoint. Davos is a plush ski resort set at roughly 5,100 above sea level and is located roughly 70 miles southeast of Zurich. Most people take a train, bus, or car to visit the picturesque town, but for the most powerful person in the world, that simply won’t do. As such, Air Force One landed in Zurich where the President promptly boarded one of two VH-60N White Hawk helicopters —better known as “Marine One” when the President is onboard— operated by HMX-1. Davos, Switzerland, MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images On January 26th, 2016 the president’s entourage, Secret Service detail, counter assault team, press pool and others were airlifted by Swiss Cougar and U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters instead of the usual fare of “Green Top” MV-22 Ospreys that are also operated by HMX-1. This isn’t unusual when traveling abroad to a very friendly country and saves massively on logistics costs of forward deploying those assets. A secure landing zone, replete with watch tower and snipers, was setup to receive the flight. The heavy security is understandable considering the high cliffs and ample cover surrounding the landing area. The space was also likely used to shuttle other dignitaries to the summit on Swiss helicopters. Seven helicopters in total were used for the presidential airlift mission, a spectacle that made press in its own right. Here are a number of videos detailing the incredibly seamless and but complex operation, including a unique configuration of the presidential motorcade rolling through the streets of Davos as skiers look on. There is also video of the President’s departure from the alpine village: https://youtube.com/watch?v=XDHUJGDJPmk https://youtube.com/watch?v=qwD4MN7Kl8c Here are some gorgeous shots from the same visit: White House AP Photo credit should read MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images Both “White Tops,” HMX-1’s VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns, will be retired in the coming decade. In their place will be a single unified fleet of Sikorsky VH-92s , the first of which took its maiden test flight last August. Under the plan 21 aircraft will be procured, with initial operating capability being set for 2020 if everything continues on a smooth path. By the time they are fully retired, the VH-3Ds will have been flying the President for nearly half a century, with the Sea King in general dating back many more years than that in the vaunted role.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 15, 2018",Airliners And F-15s Involved In Bizarre Encounter With Mystery Aircraft Over Oregon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Something quite out of the ordinary occurred in the skies over Oregon on October 25th, 2017. A mystery aircraft was flying in daylight hours among the steady stream of airliners that traverse from south to north, between locales in California and Nevada and cities like Portland and Seattle and beyond. The incident began, at least as best we can tell, around 4:30pm near the California-Oregon border and resulted in multiple pilot eyewitnesses, recorded air traffic control audio, and eventual confirmations from both the FAA and North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) that it did indeed occur. Author’s note: We have posted an update to this story linked here that not only has full radio communications from the event but also all the FAA phone conversations that took place during and after the incident occurred. Read this post in full first and then go to the update for full context. The first inklings of the story came to me shortly after the incident occurred from friends of mine in the aviation world. Sparse on details at the time, it sounded like it was probably just another one of the often misconstrued incidents that happen in the skies around the US everyday—ones where aircraft with inoperable radios or transponders stray into areas they shouldn’t. And sometimes these occurrences result in local fighter jets paying the wayward aircraft a visit at the direction of NORAD. But days after initially blowing off the incident, it later began to seem that there was indeed more to the story than just than another “ NORDO ” private aircraft or lackadaisical pilot. I came upon one Reddit thread that was of particular interest that seemed to not only corroborate the strange account, it also added critical details. The post was supposedly penned by a pilot who says they were in the sky over the Northwest in the early evening when the incident occurred, with the post coming shortly after the incident. The entry by Reddit user “Duprass” reads: “Just landed in Seattle coming from the bay area. Beginning over Southern Oregon we kept overhearing Seattle Center attempting to track an airplane with no transponder who wasn’t talking. A handful of crews were able to track it visually, best they could tell it was between FL350-370 [35,000-37,000 feet], northbound. Nobody close enough to see the type. Last we heard it was over the Willamette valley northbound and some fighters, perhaps out of PDX [Portland International Airport], were scrambled to go take a peek. Center had trouble tracking it on primary radar. Strange! My theory is they were running drugs to Canada. No news yet, not that I could find. **Update 0500z. Called SEA ARTCC. The gentleman I spoke with said that they initially got alerted to the aircraft from Oakland Center who was painting it on primary [illuminating it with radar, but without transponder information]. For whatever reason they couldn’t track it themselves on primary, and that’s when I overheard them using airline aircraft to track it visually. The last airplane to see it had to descend into Portland and lost sight of it. The fighters were scrambled out of PDX but flew around for a while and did not find it. And that’s that.” Air traffic control audio recorded over at LiveATC.com of Seattle Center Sector 14 is available from the time of the incident and it corroborates much of this information. You can listen to the entire series of exchanges here starting at around the 20 minute mark and through to the first part of the next time interval recording that can be found here. The audio is fantastic as it illustrates that there were many communications between various jet crews and Seattle Center whose controllers tried to track the aircraft as it made its way north towards the Willamette Valley. The aircraft was not able to be tracked on radar nor did it show up on crews’ digital traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS) , but it was clearly there, although never quite close enough to positively identify what its exact type was. The activity seems to have begun in the far reaches of Northern California, around Mt. Shasta, and continued on into Southern Oregon, past Crater Lake and up through the Willamette Valley (Stock Photo)., Adrian Studer/Getty Images The back and forth between air traffic control and various airline pilots lasted for roughly half an hour. Recordings from other Seattle Center Sectors, such as those closer to Portland (namely 42 and 46) are not readily available and it’s very possible—if not probable based on other reports—that the incident continued up the Willamette Valley. We did review PDX approach and tower exchanges from a half hour before to two hours after the event occurred and didn’t find anything that stood out, although it was unlikely we would have as aircraft have descended when using those frequencies. After reading this account and listening to the audio it was clear that the incident was worth looking into on a much deeper level, and that’s what we did, inquiring with the 142nd Fighter Wing based at Portland International Airport, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the FAA about the odd ordeal. NORAD’s reply was quick and clear. An incident involving multiple airline crews, air traffic control, and F-15Cs from the 142nd Fighter Wing based out of Portland did occur. According to the limited information NORAD supplied, airliner pilots were asked by FAA air traffic controllers to help track and possibly identify a “white aircraft” traveling in the flightlevels nearby—roughly between 35,000 and 40,000 feet based on the radio recordings. NORAD also said that the incident did result in F-15s from Portland being scrambled to investigate, but by the time they got up and “looked around” the mystery aircraft couldn’t be found. Seattle Center sector map., Seattle ARTCC A quick note on the fighter jet aspect of this story—the 142nd Fighter Wing operates F-15Cs upgraded with the most capable air-to-air radar set in the world (AN/APG-63V3) and Sniper advanced targeting pods for long-rang visual identification. Their pilots are some of the best in the world and are highly trained in the homeland air defense mission. The fact that they “didn’t find anything” is surprising to say the least. Maybe this was due to the nature of the aircraft being searched for, or the possibility that they launched long after it was first sighted, or that we simply aren’t being told the whole story. As for the F-15’s launch time, it seems that this mystery aircraft was moving fairly fast—at least at the same speed of the airliners around it or greater. It’s also worth noting that Oakland Center, which controls airspace to the south of Seattle Center’s responsibilities, could have been trying to track the aircraft before the communications began on Seattle Center’s frequencies if the object emanated from farther south. We have reviewed the PDX air traffic control audio up to two hours after the first radio traffic began regarding the mystery aircraft between Seattle Center and airliner pilots and we did not readily hear the tower clear the F-15s for launch. As such it’s not clear when exactly the fighters took to the skies in search of this unidentified aircraft or why they were launched so late if that was the case. It is also possible, albeit somewhat unlikely, that a fighter patrol could have been diverted if they were already airborne. Also, once in the air the F-15s are capable of traversing the entire state of Oregon in just a matter of minutes if need be, so if they were launched promptly it seems unlikely they wouldn’t have been able to intercept the aircraft being pointed out by commercial pilots over Southern Oregon. The FAA wasn’t as forthcoming as NORAD, taking nearly a week and multiple emails to respond to our initial inquiry, only to say simply that they have nothing further to add to the description of events I provided to them. As such, they did acknowledge that the events occurred, but did not expand upon them. The 142nd Fighter Wing did not respond to our inquiries. Clearly there had to be some level of after-action investigation into this event. Having an unidentified aircraft that doesn’t show up on radar flying among civilian air traffic in the flight levels for extended periods of time isn’t something you just brush off, especially considering the current global security situation and the circumstances that have existed since 9/11. Western Air Defense Sector (WADS), which goes by the callsign “Bigfoot,” keeps a close watch on airspace over the Northwest and directs alert fighters and fighter patrols to targets of interest on short notice. , Washington Military Department One of the Reddit posters with the handle “The Flying Beard” from the same thread, who supposedly is an air traffic controller, claims to have some inside knowledge of the event, stating: “…Was just going to post about this actually. I was working an adjacent sector and was helping to coordinate some of the military stuff. They ended up launching F15s off of PDX to try and find it but no joy… [posts one of the audio clips linked above]… The crazy thing is, we didn’t have a primary target or a mode C intruder, and it was out running 737s abeam it. Also, (cue conspiracy theory) our QA department was working on this today, and got a call from the commander of the 142FW at PDX and was basically told to knock it off, and we know nothing. A couple guys at work seem to think it may have have been this plane [unlikely, and that’s an article I wrote] based of the description, and also the ‘lack’ of military interest. FWIW, I think the FAA is pursing this at higher levels. From a safety standpoint, if the military is running super secret test stuff in the NAS [National Airspace], that’s bad. If I were one of the pilots that had a sighting, I’d definitely be filing a NASA form and any other official reports that you can… …If the ‘aircraft’ continued on its presumed heading/course altitude, the F15s were sent the wrong way. The last known position was around the EUG area heading North around 750kts and the fighters went South when they launched ~25-30 min after the first report in the Shasta area… …The time of day made it hard. All the guys on the east side couldn’t see it due to the setting sun and the North bound traffic on the west side was pretty sparse. I guess ZOA [Oakland Center] had a good primary/mode C on the guy for a bit in the RBL [Red Bluff Municipal Airport] area. It was initially heading SW and it made a pretty sharp turn to the North. Way harder/faster than what a commercial aircraft could handle at that speed/altitude without ripping the wings off.” We have no way of confirming this poster’s information, although based on past Reddit posts their occupation description seems accurate, and their account certainly does add to the story if true. We have filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the FAA and NORAD, as well as other federal parties involved in the incident. Hopefully we will find out more eventually as to what really went on that day so we can provide a more complete picture for our readers. An F-15C belonging to the 142nd Fighter Wing blasts out of Portland International Airport on a typical rainy day in the Northwest. Portland Air National Guard Base (PANG), which is co-located across from PDX’s passenger terminals, is seen in the background. The 142nd’s Eagles cover the airspace from northern California to the northern tip of Washington State and sometimes beyond. Two primary fully armed jets are always on quick reaction alert (QRA) and can launch within a few minutes of the klaxon howling. An armed spare jet is also usually available as well as one armed with a full magazine of 940 20mm cannon shells., Tyler Rogoway/author In the meantime, I would suggest reading the Reddit thread related to the event after listening to the air traffic control audio yourself . In it, some say it could have been a smuggling aircraft or even a secret military airframe. It seems odd that a smuggler would fly in broad daylight in an area they know they will be spotted, not to mention the question of how they stayed off the FAA radar scopes. When it comes to a secret military aircraft, flying such an asset among jetliner traffic in daylight, albeit it was around sunset time, certainly seems like an odd choice for a secretive program, but that doesn’t make it impossible. There are vast and remote training ranges that could be taken advantage of in Alaska for clandestine aircraft programs, and it is a long flight to get there. Still, the idea that U.S. military would willingly fly an aircraft through a major air traffic route at common jet operating altitudes without radio, transponder, or even radar contact would be highly concerning if true. Amongst all the questions that remain, one thing is certain, an unidentified white aircraft was indeed flying over Oregon on that day in October, and the USAF and the FAA are both willing to admit that the event occurred. In the Air Force’s case, the fact that they are even willing to tell us that they couldn’t catch or even find the unidentified aircraft with their sensor-packed and fast F-15s is interesting to say the least. On the other hand they may not be sharing the entire story with us. Whatever the case, we’ll keep you updated on this white flying mystery machine of sorts and the circumstances surrounding its presence over Oregon when, or should I say if, new information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 2, 2018",China Is Surging Forward With Its Development Of Advanced Stealth Combat Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China has been quietly developing a penetrating unmanned aircraft capability over the last decade, but in recent weeks their efforts to field such a concept have seemed to of accelerated and become more public. This is occurring as American unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) development efforts have totally disappeared from the public domain, a phenomenon we have detailed in great depth , and one that has significant strategic repercussions. At this year’s Singapore Air Show, Chinese aerospace company Star Systems showed off a model of its stealthy “Star Shadow” flying-wing drone. It’s design is very familiar, looking like something of a mix between the American P170 Polecat and X-47B designs , as well as Boeing’s conceptual art for their failed Long Range Strike Bomber entrant. Star Systems concept art In fact, it eerily matches the look of an unmanned aircraft configuration released by Boeing, possibly taken from an actual simulation, for an unmanned aircraft refueling capability. Boeing Image Its similarities to American concepts does not mean the Star Shadow is a direct copy or knock off as western media usually proclaims whenever any Chinese weaponry resembles its American counterparts. Still, Chinese cyber espionage activities are notorious, and the country certainly was given a massive leap in low-observable unmanned technology—not to mention the communications infrastructure that supports it—by being able to closely examine the RQ-170 Sentinel that fell into Iranian hands in late 2011. As for the Star Shadow itself, supposedly it has roughly a 49 foot wingspan, is 23 feet long, has a gross takeoff weight of 9,000lbs and is capable of carrying a 900lb payload. It has a 10-12 hour endurance, a ceiling of roughly 45,000 feet and is powered by two TWS-800 turbofan engines. Overall it seems that the aircraft is similar in proportions to that of the RQ-170 Sentinel. And although Star Systems says this is an internally funded program, that may not be the whole story. The Star Shadow model displayed at the 2018 Singapore Air Show., Chinese Internet Last August, The War Zone debunked a report based on a satellite image that said Beijing’s stealth bomber had been spotted. We pointed out that the image was actually of a much smaller flying wing design, likely a radar cross-section test article, located at a radar cross-section test range not far from Beijing. The airframe pictured in the satellite image had a wingspan of only around 50 feet. It turns out that this design matches the Star Shadow’s exactly, including its dimensions. Our conclusion at the time posited exactly this, stating: “There is a decent chance that we will see China’s new prototype bomber in the not so distant future—which will represent not just a massive leap in combat capability but also one in construction techniques and material science for Beijing—but this absolutely isn’t it. Although it could share its shape, it’s more likely that the article belongs to China’s quickly advancing unmanned combat air vehicle development initiative or that of other flying wing drone programs—like the “Star Glory” SG-1 and CH-805 that are presently underway. The Star Glory in particular looks very similar to the object spotted in the satellite image and its stated dimensions seem near spot on.” In fact, it seems as if Star Systems has just refined their original SG-1 “Star Glory” concept and renamed it. Regardless, of its title, Star Systems says the aircraft’s first flight is scheduled for next year, but we really have no idea how far along the project actually is. With a full scale radar cross-section test article existing, it’s probably further along than we are being told. The company now claims that the aircraft has a radar cross section of .1 square meter. This claim likely comes from validation testing done at the radar facility seen in the satellite image from last summer. But this stealthy flying-wing unmanned aircraft program is one of number of similar initiatives that China is actively touting. Another program has emerged recently belonging to Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) dubbed “Tianying.” This aircraft is said to have already made three flights with the program beginning four years ago. “Eighty percent of our drone’s technologies are the newest and most advanced, some of which are leading the global [drone] industry” Ma Hongzhong, Tianying’s chief designer said on Chinese social media. The aircraft is said to have been designed for long-range operations. Pictures of the craft surrounded by the CASIC team that designed it were also posted online, with the aircraft being blurred out, although its flying-wing design is clearly evident. Chinese Internet Another Chinese flying-wing drone also emerged on social media recently. Supposedly it belongs to Chengdu—China’s premier fighter aircraft manufacturer. It isn’t clear if the type is a sub-scale test article of a larger system or some other research and development effort. There have been rumors that China is working on an unmanned flying wing design that can have its wings swapped out for different mission profiles. For instance, longer, more slender wings for high-altitude endurance operations and shorter, thicker wings for maximum kinematic performance and maneuverability. It’s worth noting that the same tow bar appears in both the tweet below and the image above. Although that doesn’t mean it’s the same aircraft, it does gives us an indication of scale. Chengdu has largely pioneered China’s stealth aircraft technology, with their J-20 being the first stealth fighter outside the United States that has entered operational service. It seems like a given that the company would also step into the UCAV space, especially considering their stealthy sensor, communications, and advanced avionics sub-systems integration knowledge . The first appearance of a large-scale Chinese built stealthy UCAV-like aircraft was in 2013 in the form of the “Sharp Sword.” This aircraft design is from Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute and Aviation Industry Corporation of China, with Hongdu Aviation Industry Group doing the construction work on the project. The system is understood to be progenitor of a high-end UCAV that will be coming online sometime around 2020. It is thought to be capable of carrying a similar payload to manned tactical aircraft, namely two 2,000lb class guided munitions, as well as the satellite communications systems needed to enable missions far from the Chinese mainland. UCAVs typically have a range advantage over their manned counterparts which equates to roughly two to four times the combat radius. Sharp Sword, Chinese Internet With this in mind, it seems that the Star Shadow would more concentrated on medium altitude, medium endurance information, surveillance and reconnaissance mission sets like the RQ-170 and the Sharp Sword—or an operational variant that emerges from it—will take on the strike mission set as a proper UCAV. And again, we only get to see what the Chinese want us to. We know of other flying wing drone programs under development as well ( War Eagle , CH-805 , Sky Bow etc) and there are certainly other programs we don’t know about. There are also unmanned combat aircraft programs that don’t rely on a flying-wing planform but include stealthy features. But still, those we do get to see give us an insight into where China is heading with this technology and how aggressively they are pursuing it on various fronts. It’s also worth noting that despite the negative inflection usually associated with operational Chinese unmanned aircraft, their growing Wing Loong and CH-4 family of systems that resemble the U.S. Predator/Reaper family is actually effective on the battlefield and has achieved export success. Sure they are not of the quality of their American counterparts, but they also cost far less and are more accessible to international customers. There is nothing to say that China won’t export some of its UCAV or penetrating reconnaissance drones as well. Similar developments are also occurring in the small drone swarm space. In contrast to China, there is virtually no official talk of fielding an American stealthy UCAV fleet, and very little talk about the stealthy flying-wing unmanned surveillance craft that are known to exist . That doesn’t mean the concept hasn’t been developed by the USAF under the cloak of deep classification since it disappeared from public view in the late 2000s. Otherwise, if it hasn’t, and the social norms of manned air combat have taken precedence over the biggest breakthrough in air combat technology since the jet engine, it’s highly alarming. Either way, the US is building a future air combat strategy that is void of semi-autonomous UCAVs, or even large fleets of penetrating stealthy reconnaissance aircraft, one that will impact the country’s ability to fight and win for decades to come. Once again we lay out this highly troubling reality in this past special feature , it is a must read because we can’t do it just simply by recapping it all again here. X-47B landing aboard a carrier. The program was largely a transformative moment for the Navy, but never paid off in terms of launching a naval UCAV program. Instead the Navy has decided to field an unmanned tanker, but even that project’s is slow coming and has a questionable future. , USN Even the Secretary of Defense has trouble with the nomenclature surrounding unmanned aircraft and the very idea of unlocking their autonomous potential. Military.com quoted the Defense Secretary James Mattis as stating the following during a trip to Europe: “One of the most misnamed weapons in our system is the unmanned aerial vehicle. It may not have a person in the cockpit, but there’s someone flying it… There’s someone over their shoulder. There’s actually more people probably flying it than a manned airplane… There’s all these people taking the downloads from it. There’s people deciding to load bombs on it or not, or ISR cameras, surveillance cameras, on it… It’s not unmanned.” He is right when discussing Predator and Reaper drones which include a man-in-the-loop actually flying the aircraft, but that concept of operations is somewhat archaic compared to a semi-autonomous “point and click” concepts of operation which have existed since the early 2000s and has been proven operationally by the RQ-4 Global Hawk among other less known systems. He went on to discuss AI, and as a result, autonomy, which is the future of air combat: “The fundamental nature of war is almost like H20, OK, and you know what it is. It’s equipment, technology, courage, competence, integration of capabilities, fear, cowardice—all these things mixed together into a very fundamentally unpredictable, fundamental nature of war… The character of war changes all the time… An old dead German [Carl von Clausewitz] called it a chameleon, OK?… All these questions… I don’t know right now, because at some point there’s going to be a human who does something— even if it’s nothing more than open the garage door and let them out… If we ever get to the point where it’s completely on automatic pilot and we’re all spectators, then it’s no longer serving a political purpose. And conflict is a social problem that needs social solutions—people, human solutions, OK?” I can tell you that our potential enemies have no trouble defining these systems or embracing their game-changing capabilities, regardless of the moral ambiguity that may go along with it. What we are left with is potentially a missed opportunity of epic proportions. We could be spending considerable effort not simply trying to build a better fighter jet but to leap-frog the enemy in full by totally changing the game via investing in advanced unmanned air combat technologies. Boeing had high hopes for its X-45C after the highly successful UCAV demonstration, but the program found little interest from the USAF., Boeing Instead it seems the USAF and the Navy are concentrating on keeping a human totally in the loop via manned-unmanned teaming and other concepts . This is fine for some interim applications but totally keeps the great potential of autonomous swarming UCAVs under lock and key, and therefore stunts their inevitable growth. The ability to take the man out of the equation to a large degree, and let the networked UCAV swarm reach its maximum potential to work as fast as possible to overwhelm and neutralize the enemy’s defenses and war fighting abilities is both a transformative concept and an inevitable one. And no, this is not about “Skynet” or unleashing free-thinking “robot” weapons onto the world haphazardly—those ideas may grab headlines in tech blogs but they are not an accurate description of unmanned autonomy in most respects. Even allowing a UCAV to fly into enemy territory, avoid or destroy enemy defenses, drop its weapon on an assigned target, and return back to uncontested airspace, all without communicating unless there is a major problem, is a form of autonomy that is no more ethically questionable than employing cruise missiles. It may sound prudent to keep a lid on this technology, and doing so definitely benefits current big ticket fighter jet and other air combat related programs which cannot compete in many key respects with UCAVs, but we don’t have a say over what our enemies do in this regard. With that in mind, we are far better off leading in this space than following, and doing so can’t be done piecemeal under a vail of secrecy. Big decisions are being made right now that dictate America’s air combat capabilities for decades to come, and those choices are being made in a bizarrely filtered reality where UCAVs and even penetrating stealthy surveillance drone don’t really exist. In the meantime China is accelerating its efforts in these respects judging by just what they allow us to see and Russia isn’t standing totally idle either. If anything else, these developments serve as a reminder that we face real technological competition abroad and in order to succeed in widening the qualitative gap once again, past traditions and social dogma—largely those surrounding the fighter pilot and keeping unmanned autonomy in a bottle—need to be jettisoned with haste. Considering the U.S. still has an edge over China in regards to this technology, now is the time to embrace it by integrating it into the Pentagon’s overall war fighting strategy and back its accelerated development with significant dollars.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 24, 2025",Satellite Imagery Confirms Russia Deployed Stealthy Su-57 Fighters To Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Our initial analysis has been outright confirmed and at least two Russian Su-57s have been forward-deployed to Khmeimim Air Base in western Syria. Satellite imagery dated February 23rd, 2018 shows two of the aircraft parked on the base’s tightly packed fixed-wing tactical aircraft ramp. It appears that one of the aircraft wears the “shark” scheme, first seen of fifth T-50 prototype “Blue 055,” while the other seems to wear a similar paint job, albeit with less contrast and a “pixelated” or “digitized” design first on T-50 “Blue 509.” Blue 055 suffered a bad engine fire during a ground run in 2014, resulting in severe damage to its airframe. The aircraft was returned to flying condition in 2016 by using parts from an unfinished T-50 prototype. Another satellite image appears to show an Su-57 cocooned in modular barriers on the base’s southern ramp area, possibly taken at a later time than the image above. We must note that the origin of this image has not been confirmed. The barriers, which can be used to create temporary revetments, have began to appear at the base following a series of attacks, one of which was executed via a group of GPS guided drones, in early January. Some sources have claimed two additional Su-57s arrived the day after the initial pair, with images showing a pair of the jets flanked by Su-35s approaching the base. From what we can tell, this is just another angle of the first pair arriving, but with limited information available, we cannot rule out the presence of four Su-57s instead of just the pair. Russia usually sends batches of four high-end tactical jets to the Syrian theater at a time, and just two would make generating sorties very challenging, especially considering the aircraft is still quite immature. But there are roughly a dozen Su-57s (also known by its pre-operational T-50 designation) in existence, and many of them are early prototype models. So the idea that Russia would commit four to Syria at such an early time would be a bold move, but not really an unexpected one. We have discussed the reasons why Russia would execute such a surprise deployment of their most technologically advanced combat aircraft, but beyond the marketing and tactical aspects of the operation, Moscow’s choice to send the Su-57 to Syria shouldn’t be surprising, as we have said it would be just a matter of time. The country has a more flexible rubric for deploying an asset into an operational combat theater than the U.S., which could be seen by some as one luxury of having little opposition oversight, especially by the media, of major defense projects. It also is indicative of how Russia develops its weaponry, which allows for greater operational risk early on in the system’s lifecycle. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9ceOnKydxgE Regardless, the jets will likely undergo what the Kremlin calls “combat evaluation,” which will work to test the aircraft’s systems over an actual combat zone and to make the case for the jet to potential export customers. It is also likely aimed at saving the long-struggling deal between New Delhi and Moscow to produce an India-specific version of the jet. Russia’s initiative to showcase its weapon systems in Syria, and slapping on the “proven in combat” badge of approval on them, has indeed worked well over the past two and a half years when it comes to drumming up sales of some of the country’s most technologically advanced and expensive weapons to foreign customers. Russia itself has struggled to buy significant numbers of Su-57s even as the program winds down primary development and moves towards operational testing. Instead the Ministry of Defense has ended up purchasing less expensive and far more mature Su-35s instead . The War Zone wrote the following in 2017: “Despite initial plans to have built 150 of Sukhoi’s T-50 stealth fighter by 2020, the Kremlin has now scaled that back to a buy of just a dozen aircraft. This year, after more than seven years of flight testing, the Russian military hopes to finally take delivery of the 10th and 11th pre-production prototypes.” Now we’ll have to wait and see how Russia publicizes the Su-57’s presence in Syria and if they attempt to challenge airspace patrolled by American fighters, namely F-22 Raptors. And yes, this plot setup sounds exactly like it was ripped right out of a somewhat far-fetched military techno-thriller novel. Strange times indeed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 385 foot wide, six engine Stratolaunch is creeping quickly towards its inaugural flight, literally. In recent days there have been sightings of monstrous space-launch mothership scooting around Mojave Air and Space Port. Now the project’s primary benefactor Paul Allen has posted some incredible footage of the aircraft undergoing high-speed ground-tests before its first flight. Allen notes in his tweet that the gargantuan jet got up to a speed of 46 miles an hour, which is scooting along the ground pretty fast for an aircraft that will tip the scales at 1.3M pounds once it is fully loaded. The clip of the aircraft doing a run down the runway looks like something out of a science fiction movie or a computer generated vaporware concept. You can read all about Stratolaunch in our pervious piece on the system , its concept, and its history. Business prospects for quickly and cheaply launching smaller satellites into orbit have looked even more positive in recent months as the Pentagon has become more focused on making its capabilities in space more resilient and flexible. The Defense Department is now actively planning for space to be the next major battlefield, an eventuality we at The War Zone have been warning about for a long time. General Goldfein, the USAF’s top officer, stated the following just last week: “I believe we’re going to be fighting from space in a matter of years. And we are the service that must lead joint war fighting in this new contested domain. This is what the nation demands.” The aircraft is powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4056 turbofan engines—the same engine that powers many 747-400s—putting out a combined 340,500 pounds of thrust. , Stratolaunch The DoD’s plans include achieving short-notice (minutes and hours, not weeks and months) and economical access to space that could allow for the replacement of disabled or destroyed satellites with relative ease during a time of war. The hope is that this capability in itself would act as a deterrent against enemy anti-satellite operations. Making the whole concept more enticing is the trend towards miniaturization of satellite systems , allowing far smaller orbital objects to pack the same features of much larger legacy systems. With this in mind, the Air Force’s 2019 budget lays out a $192.5M initiative over five years for a “small launch” space access program when the force will purchase and support commercial providers who are aiming to offer these services. USAF Secretary Heather Wilson says the objective of the program is to help incubate a “variety of launch capabilities in order to have assured access to space.” Stratolaunch The Pentagon is also working on everything from a space plane , to realizing cheaper rocket launches, to so called “ride sharing” programs with larger payloads, as well outside of this program. And there are surely others that remain cloaked in the classified realm as well. Maybe the biggest competitor, at least directly with Stratolaunch’s concept is Virgin Orbit which was established just last year. America’s potentially enemies are also working on similar concepts. Stratolaunch has its eyes set on becoming operational and hopefully income generating by the end of the decade. By the looks of it that could very well happen—if things continue as planned. The aircraft is theoretically capable of launching a range of rockets 2,000 miles from its takeoff point, with payloads up to 13,500lbs being able to achieve low earth orbit and 4,500lbs for geo-stationary orbit. But it seems the aircraft’s bread and butter work will be based around Orbital ATK’s Pegasus XL rocket which can put a 1,000lb payload into low earth orbit. The aircraft should be able to launch multiples of these rockets on a single sortie. So beyond being an incredible machine and a new landmark in aviation, the charismatic flying behemoth could usher in a new era in space access that can have a huge impact not just on our lives but also on the Pentagon’s future war-fighting plans.
