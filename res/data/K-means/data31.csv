By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A retired U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress nicknamed ‘Damage Inc. II’ was recently taken out of storage at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group’s ‘boneyard’ at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and disassembled before beginning its journey eastward across the country to be partially reassembled for research and development purposes. Now the stripped-down ‘BUFF’ is on the road and drawing huge amounts of attention. ‘Damage Inc. II’s incredible journey is being officially documented by Boneyard Safari . The group’s Ramón C Purcell, who is on the road with the bomber’s caravan, was kind enough to share his fantastic images of the journey so far and some details about the operation with us. B-52H 61-0009 was constructed in 1961. After serving for decades with various bomber units, on Sep 25, 2008, she made her final flight to the Aircraft Maintenance And Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan. There 61-0009 sat for fourteen years until the Air Force decided on a new use for the decommissioned, aging aircraft. Damage Inc. II (61-0009) photographed while stored at AMARG. , USAF A contracting notice regarding the disassembly, transport, and reassembly of the aircraft was posted online in February 2021 , giving the work a potential total value of $2.8 million. Maryland-based aerospace engineering firm J.F. Taylor was awarded the contract . The bomber was pulled from the boneyard last July and moved to the nearby Pima Air and Space Museum . The disassembly for its journey from Tucson, Arizona, to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, took nearly four months , after which it was prepared for its overland trip. World Wide Aircraft Recovery is overseeing the project and Ball and Son are actually moving the bomber, which is something of a herculean task. The Fuselage is so long and tall that things like traversing overpasses or turning through intersections have margins measured in mere inches. The entire convoy finally hit the road early Monday morning, pulling out of the Pima Air and Space Museum to start what will be a long and challenging journey. Purcell tells The War Zone that the B-52 and its escorts take up two lanes of traffic so they have to pull over every five miles or so to let traffic pass, which makes for slow going. Just going 50 miles from Pima took over six hours . Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Even with the inconvenience, people don’t seem too put out by the operation. According to Purcell, they just seem excited if not stunned to see the iconic bomber on the road. At some stops, crowds of onlookers have come to check out the B-52 and even some veteran aircrew have had a chance to interact with their old mount, including one of the last tail gunners to crew B-52s . In all, the B-52’s trip to its new home could take up to four weeks, depending on many factors including weather, which the team hopes to avoid. Some are sure to ask why not just fly 61-0009 out to Oklahoma City instead of executing such an arduous road-transport operation. Regenerating the bomber would have taken a massive amount of work and cost a huge sum of money just so that it could take one flight. There is also competing demand for resources and capacity for such a task. Seeing as it will never fly again anyway, just moving it over land was a far more logical option, although it’s not without its own challenges, to say the least. Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Ramón C Purcell/Boneyard Safari Along with the 61-0009’s fuselage, its left wing will be transported to a Boeing facility in Oklahoma City where they will be reattached to form what is known as an integration model. It will be used to test how new systems can be integrated into the B-52’s 70-year-old design. With the B-52H slated to serve alongside the new B-21 Raider for decades to come, a rash of upgrades is planned to keep the aircraft relevant. These range from new sensors , communications systems, defensive countermeasures, avionics , and especially new engines. Rolls-Royce has been tapped to finally give the Air Force’s remaining B-52 fleet, which is made up of 76 aircraft, modern engines that will greatly enhance the aircraft’s capabilities, efficiency, reliability, and overall sustainability. Initial fitment and integration work for the new engines will be extensive and using 61-0009 for much of it will drastically reduce cost and risk as opposed to a flying example. New weapons integration is another major mission for 61-0009’s future mission. The B-52H will be the USAF’s outsized weapons truck of choice for the foreseeable future and will continue to lead the air-launched hypersonic weapons initiative . Currently, the USAF first hypersonic weapon slated to enter service, the AGM-183 ARRW, is exclusive to the B-52. The aircraft is getting new pylons to accept large and heavy weapons in the future, as well. “There are so many things this [integration model] can be used for,” Col. Louis Ruscetta, B-52 Senior Materiel Leader with the Bombers Directorate, said in a USAF press release .  “As new weapons are developed and come on hand, we can use it [integration model] to see how the weapons attach, what needs to change, and if they fit on the aircraft.  This is an asset that will help us integrate different items onto the aircraft quicker. An additional benefit is the cost to maintain a mock-up is fairly low.” The aircraft’s now detached right wing and horizontal stabilizer, meanwhile, will be shipped to McFarland Research and Development in Kansas where they will be used in research supporting the B-52H Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). ASIP is a USAF program that began in the late 1950s after a series of catastrophic accidents caused by structural fatigue. Since then, ASIP has been responsible for designing, analyzing, and testing aircraft and their components for structural integrity. Now that the B-52 is approaching 70 years old, it’s vital for the service to understand how long they can expect its components to remain in working condition. Brig. Gen. John Newberry, Director of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Bombers Directorate, said turning 61-009 into an integration model is a “wonderful initiative to repurpose a retired B-52 into a tool to advance the fleet’s modernization and sustainment efforts for decades to come.” Thanks to our talented friends at Boneyard Safari we are getting a great look at the start of what will likely be an absolutely critical endeavor to the future viability of the B-52 fleet.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jul 8, 2020",The Navy Is Betting Big On High-Power Microwave Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, or NSWCDD, has created a new division specifically for researching and developing high-power microwave (HPM) directed-energy weapons. Unlike lasers, which the Navy also is investing in heavily, this emerging class of weapon systems uses bursts of microwave energy to disrupt or destroy the electronics inside various enemy systems, including drones, small boats, and missiles. As asymmetric threats continue to pose threats to high-value military assets, these weapons could soon provide the Navy with an extra layer of defense if its research and development efforts pan out. Prior to this reorganization, one NSWCDD research division was responsible for both laser weapons and HPM. In a Naval Sea Systems Command press release announcing the creation of the new division, Weapon Systems Division Head Kevin Cogley says, however, that lasers and HPM weapons can actually complement laser weapons, rather than compete with them. “HPM and lasers work in parallel in a lot of areas,” Cogley said. “One thing that is unique in the HPM arena is that we can have graduated effects. In HPM, we can have a range of effects on target – from basically jamming a device to physically destroying electrical systems.” While this class of weapons isn’t new per se, continuing technological advances in miniaturization and efficiency are making microwaves attractive for a wide variety of new applications . Cogley also briefly outlined the unique benefits and capabilities that microwave weapons offer. “HPM is very different than many other weapon systems because in many cases you may not see any outward physical effects during an engagement but will see nearly-instant results on the target’s operational performance,” Cogley said. “Using HPM, we can give our Sailors a capability that could be a desirable alternative to firing a kinetic weapon.” One of the most attractive aspects of high-power microwaves and other directed energy systems is that they offer a much lower cost-per-shot than kinetic weapons, which can sometimes total in the millions for a single munition . Directed energy weapons offer another unique advantage over kinetic weapons: magazine depth. Whereas kinetic weapons have fixed magazine sizes and must be physically reloaded, a HPM weapon could have an unlimited magazine, at least in a physical sense. In addition, HPM systems can potentially operate in a less than lethal manner, meaning they may be able to disable manned vehicles them without directly harming the occupants inside. Such a capability could potentially alter the rules of engagement and allow Navy vessels to engage and disable small manned craft without inflicting physical harm on their occupants. A NSWCDD slide outlining several non-lethal methods of disrupting or disabling vessels and vehicles., USN via FOIA Aside from engaging surface vehicles, HPM weapons are well-suited for use in counter unmanned aerial systems (cUAS) roles. Small drones, which are becoming more and more of a threat to a wide variety of Navy and DOD assets, are difficult for some air defense systems to track and target. Unlike lasers, which typically fire a focused beam for short periods of time, HPM weapons can fire wide-area cone-shaped beams, enabling them to engage multiple UAS at once . “The fact that you can simultaneously track and immediately move to the next target to address not just a swarm, but multiple swarms, is a big advantage,” Don Sullivan, chief technologist of directed energy at Raytheon’s Missile Systems business, said in 2018 regarding one of its HPM systems supplied to the Air Force. These wide-area effects and speed of light capabilities mean that HPM weapons could even engage targets that maneuver too rapidly for kinetic interceptors to hit. Raytheon’s Phaser high-power microwave counter-drone system, Raytheon For those reasons, and potentially more that are not disclosed, Navy Senior Technologist for Directed Energy Dr. Frank Peterkin said that HPM and other directed energy weapons “provide effective and affordable ship defense solutions that address growing threats to our ability to project power and protect freedom of the seas.” According to NAVSEA’s announcement of the reorganization, this “sets NSWCDD ahead of the curve for HPM testing.” With this new reorganization, NSWCDD becomes one of only two Department of Defense facilities with a dedicated HPM division alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. According to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), these two laboratories “collaborate on the largest HPM projects in the country, offense applications, counter unmanned aerial systems and integrated air defense topics.” HPM systems are also being eyed for missiles with non-kinetic payloads such as the joint USAF/Navy HiJENKS project , as well as for use in space aboard anti-satellite systems, although these technologies remain highly classified . The US Air Force Research Laboratory’s Tactical High-Power Operational Responder, or THOR. , USAFRL The Department of Defense (DOD) is not alone in its efforts to field HPM weapons, as potential peer-state competitors are actively pursuing them as well . They still remain one of the murkier areas of military research , however, and a high degree of confusion and misinformation surrounds the topic. There are plenty of downsides to directed energy weapons like high-power microwaves, too, including possible downtime between shots, atmospheric and meteorological interference, electromagnetic shielding countermeasures, and range constraints. A rendering of a ship-based high-power microwave system designed by Epirus., Epirus Still, given the successes that various DOD laboratories have already had in testing high-power microwave systems for use in air defense systems and counter-drone technologies , it’s easy to see why the Navy is placing a higher emphasis on HPM and standing up a specialized research division to develop them. The need for defense systems to deal with the new threats posed by small unmanned vehicle technologies is pressing, one the Navy is currently facing on a regular basis . HPM systems are well suited to deal with these growing threats, and could potentially defend against more traditional aerial threats like incoming missiles, as well. It’s likely that in the very near future, these directed energy systems could complement existing air defenses and close-in weapons systems in protecting U.S. Navy ships patrolling the high seas.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",Check Out This New Rendering Of Boeing’s Hypersonic Aircraft Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has provided additional artwork of its latest hypersonic aircraft concept, seen at the top of this story and below, and additional information about the design itself has emerged. The company unveiled a model of this design, which is an evolution of one that was first shown back in 2018 , earlier this week, as you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s initial story on this topic . Boeing The model of this hypersonic aircraft design, which Boeing has said could be used for military missions or as a space launch mothership , has been on the show floor all at the AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition in San Diego, California, which wraps up today. “We wanted to take advantage of the AIAA opportunity to showcase the progress we are making in hypersonics technology,” the company has now told The War Zone in a statement in response to a query about why it chose to first display this model now. “Over the past several years, we have advanced our vehicle design concepts, developed innovative integration solutions and matured enabling technologies in the challenging areas such as propulsion, thermal, materials, guidance navigation & control and engine/airframe integration,” that statement added. “Boeing has successfully designed, built and flown hypersonic vehicles for the last 60 years. Boeing Research & Technology has been developing hypersonic vehicle concepts and technologies in support of potential future defense applications.” Separately, Dr. Chris Combs , a Dee Howard Endowed Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and the coordinator of that university’s aerospace program, wrote on Twitter that Boeing engineers had explained the reasoning behind an apparent gap between where the forward fuselage’s mold line and the wing root on either side of the design. “So I talked to the guys that designed the vehicle. What I can say: design tools were used to optimize drag on *both* the inboard and outboard wings simultaneously,” Combs said in a Tweet that also included a video offering a perspective that shows how that gap isn’t necessarily a gap at all. “Position of the intake is also important here. This is what you get. It makes sense.” The two distinctly separated engines seen on the model of Boeing’s new hypersonic aircraft concept at AIAA are among the more notable differences between it and the design that was displayed at this same event back in 2018. The older design concept had two engines, but they were positioned in a side-by-side arrangement under the center of the fuselage. An artist’s conception of the Boeing Valkyrie hypersonic aircraft., Boeing This configuration had evoked some broad comparisons to that of the XB-70 Valkyrie supersonic bomber that North American Aviation had designed and built for the U.S Air Force in the 1960s. North American Aviation eventually merged with Rockwell, which was then acquired by Boeing, and the hypersonic aircraft concept shown four years ago was also dubbed the Valkyrie in a direct reference to the Cold War bomber. A picture of an XB-70 Valkyrie that gives a good view of its intake arrangement., USAF The positioning of the engines, and especially their intakes, is particularly important when designing air-breathing hypersonic platforms. These are typically powered by ramjets and scramjets that be very sensitive to changes in airflow and that simply cannot function effectively at lower speeds. Boeing, among others, has been working on advanced turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine configurations that blend ramjets or scramjets with more traditional jet turbines. The latter engines can then provide propulsion at lower speeds. Reliable TBCC engines that can be produced at scale and at reasonable costs are seen as a key enabler for future viable hypersonic aircraft designs that could take off and land using existing runway infrastructure. In 2016, former Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said it would take around $1 billion to produce a fighter jet-sized reusable hypersonic demonstrator aircraft. Boeing’s Valkyrie concept was widely seen as a direct response to Lockheed Martin’s unusually public discussion between 2016 and 2017 about a proposed unmanned reusable hypersonic military aircraft, called the SR-72 , that would be capable of carrying out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and strike missions. There are strong indications of significant progress in the development of advanced scramjet technology since then. “We won’t speculate on future USG requirements for this technology,” Boeing said in a statement to The War Zone when asked if its latest hypersonic concept was aimed at any U.S. government requirements, such as the U.S. Air Force’s Project Mayhem . Details about Mayhem, which you can read more about here , remain limited, but it is linked to work on TBCC engines and is seeking hypersonic aircraft demonstrators with ISR and strike capabilities. Boeing Research & Technology is publicly known to be involved in at least one commercial hypersonic aircraft venture, though its Australian branch. That project, which it is working on with Hypersonix Launch Systems , also based in Australia, is focused on the development of a mothership aircraft capable of serving as a flying platform for launching payloads into space. It will certainly be interesting to see how Boeing’s latest hypersonic aircraft concept continues to evolve as a platform for military and commercial applications.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2022",Russia Sent Electronic Warfare Systems And Armored Vehicles To Kazakhstan For Peacekeeping Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian forces have brought an electronic warfare system that includes small drones equipped with jammers , as well as tracked and wheeled light armored vehicles, with them to Kazakhstan where they are now deployed for what is officially described as a peacekeeping mission. The Collective Security Treaty Organization, a multi-national security bloc in which Russia is the principal member, agreed to send troops to support the embattled regime of Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev after mass protests triggered by a hike in fuel prices turned into open civil unrest yesterday. Authorities in Kazakhstan have already been engaged in a crackdown on demonstrators, announcing today that they “liquidated” dozens of individuals , a term the meaning of which may have been lost in translation in this context, but that has been widely reported to refer to civilian fatalities . You can get fully caught up on the current situation in the country in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting here . The Russian Ministry of Defense released various videos and pictures today showing vehicles and personnel from a mix of airborne and special operations units bound for Kazakhstan loading onto Il-76 and An-124 cargo aircraft at bases in Russia. At least one 6×6 Kamaz truck in a configuration associated with the Leer-3 electronic warfare system , also known as the RB-341V, was seen in this imagery, including the video and pictures seen below.

Forces from the other four CSTO members – Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan – are expected to be part of the final ‘peacekeeping’ contingent, with Belarusian troops already on the ground. The core missions, at least officially, of the CSTO’s force in Kazakhstan will be “to protect important state and military facilities in Kazakhstan and to assist local law enforcement officers in stabilizing the situation,” according to a report from TV Zvezda , the Russian Ministry of Defense’s television station.

The inclusion of the Leer-3 system, which consists of the Kamaz truck and between two and three specially configured Orlan-10 drones , is particularly interesting. The truck serves as the ground control center for these small unmanned aircraft, which carry small electronic warfare jammers. They are primarily intended to scramble cellphone communications, something that does seem like it would be very useful for a regime looking to break up large-scale demonstrations. This capability would help prevent protestors from coordinating with each other, as well as further prevent them from sending out pictures or videos documenting abuses on the part of government security forces. Officials in Kazakhstan already hit the country with a major internet blackout yesterday in a clear effort to conceal what was going on as reports of crackdowns in various cities first began to emerge. Orlan-10 drones also carry full-motion video cameras and, while their range is relatively limited, could be used to help monitor continued protests and otherwise provide improved situational awareness to CSTO commanders. The imagery from the Russian Ministry of Defense, including the video seen below, also showed another Kamaz truck with a large dish mounted on top of the rear end of the vehicle, which led some to speculate that this was another electronic warfare system. However, this appears to be a mobile command post vehicle carrying a communications suite to support the deployed forces. A similar command truck and Leer-3 system were among the vehicles that made up the initial elements of a different peacekeeping force that the Russian government sent to Armenia in 2020 after brokering a deal to bring an end to a brief war between that country and neighboring Azerbaijan. This would seem to suggest that these vehicles are components of at least a semi-standardized force package for these kinds of missions. It looks as though Russia's peacekeeping contingent brought RB-341V Leer-3 electronic warfare systems, which come with Orlan-10 UAVs. They can suppress mobile communications and locate cell phones and other communication systems. 2170/ https://t.co/QKEy80b8mA pic.twitter.com/ZPjtJEfOMv — Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 14, 2020 Possibly a Russian mobile command point MPUS-K that arrived with the peacekeeping contingent. 2172/ https://t.co/LH7z3WoarP pic.twitter.com/4ELWvoyUn4 — Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 14, 2020 How any of Russia’s forces, or those from other CSTO members, are ultimately employed in Kazakhstan remains to be seen. It’s similarly unknown how the Kazakh government’s own crackdown on those protesting the country’s dictatorial regime, which officials have branded as “terrorist bands” and “attackers,” will continue to evolve. There were indications yesterday that state security forces were abandoning their posts or even joining demonstrators, but Kazakh authorities seem more in control of their personnel today and are now openly talking about the lengths they have gone to start restoring order.

We don’t know at this point.” For their part, Russian officials, as well as Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakhstan’s Toqaev, have suggested that foreign actors might be behind the unrest in Kazakhstan, though no hard evidence to substantiate these claims has been offered. Lukashenko, who is a major ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s, also indicated that CSTO had been compelled to act in this case, which is the first time the bloc has ever deployed forces in response to a request from a member state, due to fears that the government there could collapse and a pro-Western regime might emerge. He specifically presented Ukraine as an example of a scenario that could not be allowed to happen in the Central Asian country. #CSTO to send peacekeepers to #kazakhstan ""in view of the threat to national security and the sovereignty of the Republic of Kazakhstan caused, among other things, by outside interference…"" And here we go… https://t.co/rfqIOX0LBJ — Jeffrey Edmonds (@jeffaedmonds) January 5, 2022 Not sure whether he means ""already gifted Ukraine to NATO"" or ""should not in the future"" https://t.co/FwzJu2CNvp — Liveuamap (@Liveuamap) January 6, 2022 A wave of popular protests led to the collapse of a pro-Russian government in Ukraine in 2013. The following year, Russia launched a military operation to seize Ukraine’s Crimea region and then began directly supporting ostensible ‘separatist’ forces in the eastern part of that country. The conflict there remains ongoing and has recently evolved into a major crisis amid fears that a new large-scale Russian intervention could come in a matter of weeks. Lukashenko himself faced a wave of serious protests in 2020, which led to speculation his regime might be in danger of collapse and that a Russian intervention to save him might be in the offing. Russian and Belarusian forces subsequently stepped up combined military exercises in the latter country, which was viewed by some at the time as an indirect way to bolster the regime. Belarus is now embroiled in a new border crisis with its European neighbors to the west, which you read more about here . All told, the situation on the ground in Kazakhstan is still very fluid as CSTO troops and their materiel, including electronic warfare systems and armored vehicles, arrive in the country. However, the extremely rapid and unprecedented decision by Russia and the rest of the bloc to deploy this force makes clear the Kremlin, at least, views maintaining the status quo in the Central Asian country as key to its own national interests.

Kazakhstan’s president, Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev, has significantly raised the stakes in the country’s ongoing unrest, giving his security forces and troops permission to “open fire with lethal force,” and without warning, during an address today. The president branded the protesters as “bandits and terrorists” as he doubled down on the crackdown, which now involves ‘peacekeeping forces’ that are arriving from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, the multinational security bloc in which Russia is the chief member. You read up on the background to the current situation in Kazakhstan in our previous reporting here . The open civil unrest began in Kazakhstan this week after a sudden hike in fuel prices , combined with long-running dissatisfaction over the economic and political situation, which in turn triggered mass protests. Two days ago the CSTO agreed to send troops to support the embattled Toqaev regime. The president said today that CSTO troops — from Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia — had not yet been engaged in the fighting. Nevertheless, this is the first time that this bloc has responded to such a request. Russian forces in the country include BMD and BTR-D light tracked armored vehicles, 8×8 BTR-82A light wheeled armored vehicles , and other light armored and tactical vehicles, plus troops.

As well as giving the order for the use of lethal force against the protesters, without warning, the president blamed “so-called free media outlets” for helping to foment unrest in the country. It’s unclear what effect Tokayev’s order will have on the government’s handling of the demonstrations but reports from the country indicate that dozens of protesters have already been killed. The country’s interior ministry reports that more than 3,000 people have now been detained, while there are reports of security forces firing on and killing and wounding groups of protesters during violent clashes. This comes after a statement from a state police spokesperson, Saltanat Azirbek, who said that “dozens of attackers were liquidated,” in an interview on state television. As we examined yesterday , the exact meaning of this phrase is not entirely clear, but it does at least tally with reports of a very heavy-handed response by local security forces. According to Tokayev’s address, “20,000 bandits” were involved in the unrest in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, which has been the epicenter of the demonstrations. The city has seen government buildings and the presidential residence stormed by demonstrators, while other buildings have been set on fire, and there has been widespread looting. Officials in Almaty have reported that 18 members of the police and the national guard have been killed so far and another 748 injured, although these figures have not been independently verified. Unconfirmed reports from Kazakhstan’s state media outlets claim that protesters are also using civilians as human shields , to further complicate the police’s response to the violence. The president today also ridiculed suggestions that the government conduct talks with protesters, branding this proposal as “idiocy” and ruling out negotiations “with armed and well-prepared bandits, both local and foreign.” Tokayev went on to say that these forces would be “destroyed… in the nearest time.” While unconfirmed, there are also reports that a first organized rebel group has been established to challenge the regime. A video that has appeared on social media purports to show the self-styled Kazakhstan Liberation Front, with militants apparently armed with AKM assault rifles and an RPK light machine gun. There is also an apparent manifesto and flag. Again, this remains unverified, but if true, the first such rebel group would be a significant development. Despite the regime rhetoric, and claims from the government that the situation is now being brought under control across the country, accounts of violent clashes and gunfire continue to emerge from Almaty and elsewhere. The airport in Almaty, which fell into the hands of protesters yesterday, has now reportedly been retaken, with the Russian defense ministry stating that its troops were now protecting the facility, as well as other vital infrastructure. Russian officials have also said that their peacekeeping forces are ensuring the security of Baikonur , home of the Russian space program in Kazakhstan. Outside of Almaty, it seems there is continued unrest in Aktobe in the west of the country and Taldykorgan in the southeast. There are also reports that most of the country’s internet and cellphone networks are still down. Footage of protesters removing the statue of the former president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev: Despite the ongoing crackdown, it seems that Tokayev is making at least some kind of an attempt to respond to some of the demands of the protesters. He has already sacked his cabinet and stripped former president Nazarbayev of his key position as head of the country’s security council. There are now suggestions that the capital, Nur-Sultan, named in honor of Nazarbayev , may revert back to its previous name, Astana. Within the international community, there is a feeling that little can be done to influence the events in Kazakhstan. So far, the response has been limited to statements from officials, including the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has spoken to his Kazakh counterpart, Mukhtar Tileuberdi. The State Department said that Blinken “advocated for a peaceful, rights-respecting resolution to the crisis.” With more CSTO forces being deployed in the country, the fear is that the use of force on behalf of the regime will continue and perhaps even escalate. The bellicose words from the Kazakh president today will have done little to allay those concerns. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 14, 2018",Scaled Composites Unveils New Encore High-Altitude Optionally Manned Aircraft Concept,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new design from Scaled Composites, the Model 412 Encore, has appeared for the first time in 3D-printed model form. The company has told us that the Model 412 Encore is currently a white paper concept in the “preliminary design phase,” that it has already been pitching the concept to a number of interested customers, and is now looking for funding to continue development, including a flying prototype. Moreover, the emergence of the concept, which is optionally manned, reflects the innovative company’s growing portfolio of modular designs that can be reconfigured for various mission sets — the Encore is anticipated as being used for a number of mission sets or as a testbed. The public’s first look at the Encore was provided by a desktop model shown on the Scaled Composites booth at the AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition that’s currently taking place in San Diego, California, as well as online. The Encore is displayed next to a model of the same company’s one-off Proteus, a manned high-altitude test platform that has flown numerous experimental missions since its first flight in 1998. Since then, Mojave-based Scaled Composites has become a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. Scaled Composites Like the Proteus, the Model 412 is optimized for high-altitude performance, flying missions at up to 70,000 feet, compared to up to 65,000 feet for the same company’s Proteus. The new aircraft is planned to carry a payload of up to 10,000 pounds which would make it ideal for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as well as various experimental test missions. While we don’t know what the Model 412’s endurance might be, the Proteus is able to remain aloft for the better part of a day. While clearly influenced by the Proteus, the Model 412 Encore exhibits some notable changes to its basic configuration, replacing the tandem wing of the earlier design with a more conventional single long-span straight wing. It retains the twin tail booms of the Proteus but adds a horizontal stabilizer to each. The powerplant arrangement appears similar, with a pair of engines mounted above the wing on the rear fuselage. The Proteus is powered by two Williams FJ44-3A commercial bizjet engines. The forward part of the fuselage of the Model 412 fuselage is also very similar to that of the Proteus fuselage. The Scaled Composites Model 281 Proteus., HANS FRIEDEL With its single main wing, the Model 412 is in some ways closer in configuration to the Model 318 White Knight . Similarly influenced by the Proteus, the White Knight is used to launch the companion SpaceShipOne experimental suborbital manned spaceship, hauling it to altitude for launch. Unlike the White Knight, the Encore has low-mounted tailplanes, and has lost the protruding gear extensions from the front of the tail booms. The Model 318 White Knight., Don Ramey Logan The desktop model of the Encore doesn’t appear to be fitted with any kind of external payload but it’s to be expected that it would adopt the same arrangement as the Proteus. This aircraft has carved a niche for itself thanks to its ability to carry a wide range of payloads in central gondola-like pods. The Proteus fitted with a mission pod related to a NASA test flight., NASA While the Proteus has carried aloft payloads including rockets, NASA scientific payloads , dummy bombs, and the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program radar (MP-RTIP) for the Global Hawk, the Encore’s ISR role would involve it being fitted with a range of likely modular sensor payloads, perhaps including synthetic aperture radar with ground moving target indicator ( GMTI ) mode, multi-spectral electro-optical sensors, electronic intelligence and other electronic warfare equipment, satellite communications links, and, potentially, weapons. Intriguingly, we have heard about a military-optimized version of the Proteus in the past. Appearing as a concept in 2004, this was known as the Model 395 and was linked to an armed unmanned aircraft project dubbed Hunter-Killer. Unlike the Model 412, this project was intended to be exclusively unmanned and was closer in overall configuration to the existing Proteus. Trials involving the manned Proteus dropping munitions as a ‘surrogate UAV’ at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada in 2005 were closely related to this concept. The payload-carrying capability of the Model 395 was expected to allow it to carry munitions up to and including the 5,000-pound laser-guided GBU-28/B bunker-buster bomb . The Model 395 was expected to carry loads weighing up to a total of 6,500 pounds, externally and using its more than 100 cubic feet of unused internal volume. Northrop Grumman demonstrates a weapons drop from the Proteus., Northrop Grumman Although it seems to have ultimately come to naught, the Model 395 concept does hint at the possibility of the new Model 412 being intended to fly armed missions, as well as ISR. At the time that the so-called Hunter-Killer program was being mooted, one Northrop Grumman official described the Model 395 as “a new class of UAV that is less than a Global Hawk and more than a tactical UAV like the Predator A or Heron I. ” It’s certainly possible to imagine the Model 412 occupying a similar category. What’s more, the Model 412’s ability to fly at 65,000 feet would give its weapons extreme range. It would be possible for the Encore to provide armed coverage over a very wide area and also carry the sensors needed for targeting and post-strike reconnaissance at standoff ranges. There have been some suggestions that the Model 412 might lend itself to the U.S. Air Force initiative known as MQ-Next , a replacement for the current fleet of MQ-9 Reaper drones. While the exact requirements remain undefined, the Model 412 seems an unlikely Reaper replacement, operating at a much higher altitude, closer to that of the manned U-2 spy plane. Scaled Composites also already has the optionally manned Firebird , which is in a broadly similar weight and performance class. Indeed, from an overall functional perspective, the Model 412 would seem to provide a higher-altitude complement to the Firebird in the company portfolio. The Model 355 Firebird optionally manned intelligence-gathering aircraft., NORTHROP GRUMMAN While not stealthy, the Model 412 would offer high-altitude and very long-range performance coupled while being cost-effective and able to fly multiple different missions, potentially by only swapping out the payload gondola. With the Pentagon now working to develop its Joint All-Domain Command and Control architecture, or JADC2, which aims to connect sensors from all U.S. military services into a single network , there also appears to be an emerging need for a drone that can fulfill a command-and-control and networking role. In this way, the Encore could operate on the edges of contested airspace or in non-contested airspace while networking together swarms of unmanned combat air vehicles, as well as share data between a range of other platforms. Another potential application could be as part of a future airborne laser platform, of the kind that we have talked in depth about in the past. The Missile Defense Agency has already been looking into the potential of mounting a solid-state laser on a high altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft. Although its timelines for realizing such a system may have stalled , MDA’s original requirements for such a directed-energy drone include flying above 65,000 feet, and loitering for 36 hours at a time, and Encore may well fit the bill going forward. Finally, it’s worth noting that the U.S. may not be the only intended customer for Encore. In fact, it may not even be the primary intended one. Like its lower and slower-flying Firebird cousin, providing an optionally manned HALE system with modular payload adaptability at an attractive price could open up the capability set to a large swathe of international customers, which could even involve military applications and some commercial or non-military agency work. This could include everything from mapping and environmental monitoring to surveillance and test and evaluation work. We will be sure to keep a close eye on the next developments in this intriguing program.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 23, 2021",Cyber Command Task Force Conducted Its First Offensive Operation As The Secretary Of Defense Watched,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Cyber Command task force executed what is being described as its “first offensive cyber effect operation” against real-world cyber threats. While the exact nature of the operation and its target remains unknown, the event was significant enough for the U.S. Secretary of Defense to personally attend to watch the operation in action. The operation was conducted between February and August 2021 by a task force consisting of personnel from the Maryland Air National Guard’s 175th Cyber Operations Group, the Delaware Air National Guard’s 166th Cyber Operations Squadron, U.S. Navy’s Cyber Strike Activity Sixty-Three, the U.S. Air Force’s 341st Cyber Operations Squadron, and the Air Force Reserve. The task force executed the operation from February to August last year, although the Air National Guard (ANG) just announced it this week. While there have been other offensive cyber operations conducted by U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), this is the first conducted and acknowledged by this particular task force. Cyber National Mission Force members participate in a training and readiness exercise at Fort Meade, Maryland in 2021., USCYBERCOM/Josef Cole Details about the specific threat countered by the task force’s cyber offensive are scarce, but USAF Maj. Corley Bradford, director of operations for 175th Cyberspace Operations Squadron, said the offensive cyber operation involved the security of Department of Defense information networks. “[Our] NMT was a direct contributor to [our task force] conducting a successful offensive cyber effects operation,” Bradford stated in an ANG press release . “It was a lot of excitement to finally see the fruits of our labor when [our task force] delivered its first offensive cyber effects operations during this mobilization,” said Bradford. Interestingly, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III was on hand to personally witness the operation. “It was a massive milestone,” Maj. Bradford said, “so he wanted front row seats to see the action firsthand.” U.S. Cyber Command has not released information about the target(s) of the operation. One of the largest publicly-known threats Cyber Command responded to last year was the Russian-led SolarWinds breach , but it isn’t clear if this offensive operation was related to that incident in any way. Whatever the case may be, U.S. Cyber Command held an international exercise in late 2021 in direct response to the SolarWinds incidents, and in December 2021 conducted offensive operations against international ransomware groups like those responsible for the Colonial Pipeline attack. At the same time, Russian cyberattacks have been increasing steadily alongside its recent aggressive military posturing along its border with Ukraine. The U.S. National Guard has been activating additional cyber operations units since 2015 as part of a growing emphasis on cyber operations throughout the Department of Defense. A large part of these units’ mission is to provide assistance and intelligence to state and local governments in the event of emergencies, and they actively carry out exercises to plan for such contingencies. “The Guard is in all 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia,” said Air Force Col. Timothy T. Lunderman. “If state and local officials need help they’re more likely to turn to the folks they know. The people they know are the Guard.” U.S. Air Force 2nd Lt. Robert Kocsis, an operator with the Maryland National Guard Joint Task Force Cyber, at the 175th Wing at Warfield Air National Guard Base., ANG/SrA Sarah M. McClanahan The Maryland Air National Guard’s 175th Cyber Operations Group was stood up in 2016. “We have all the ingredients to operationalize the cyber mission,” 275th Operations Support Squadron commander Col. Kevin George said at the time . “Because of our unique situation and support mechanisms we will be able to execute defense, offense and kinetic operations.” The group features members who work in civilian positions for defense contractors and cybersecurity firms, which allows the National Guard to leverage the expertise these members have gained in the private sector. While this may have been the first offensive cyber operation carried out by this particular task force, it underscores the Pentagon’s growing emphasis on cybersecurity. The White House signed an executive order last year aimed at bolstering cyber defenses throughout the intelligence community and Department of Defense, and later announced it would elevate certain cyberattacks to the same priority as terrorist attacks. While those initiatives are largely defensive in nature, Cyber Command has previously issued statements that outline how offensive cyber capabilities are also necessary to “target enemy and hostile adversary activities.” The exact nature of those capabilities remains unknown. Personnel with the 175th Cyberspace Operations Group monitor cyberattacks on the operations floor, known as the Hunter’s Den., USAF/Joseph Eddins As many recent cyber and ransomware attacks worldwide have shown , much of America’s utility networks and other critical infrastructure remain vulnerable to cyberattacks from both state and non-state actors. It’s likely the Pentagon’s emphasis on cyber capabilities, both defensive and offensive , will continue to grow as the U.S. government attempts to strengthen its ability to respond to these rapidly emerging threats.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 5, 2021",The Secretive U-2 Spy Plane Missions Flown Out Of Norway’s Bodø Airbase,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the historic Norwegian airbase at Bodø , located within the Arctic Circle, closes down today as a fighter jet station, it’s a good time to look back at one of the more secretive aspects of the base. It played the role of a vital node in the early days of the U-2 spy plane. Ultimately, this little-known chapter in aerial espionage came to an end on May 1, 1960, when a U-2 flown by Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a surface-to-air missile deep over Soviet territory. Powers had been due to complete his flight by landing at Bodø, but the international incident that followed his shoot-down led to the abrupt termination of such deep-penetration missions. Bodø, more formally Bodø Main Air Station, was for many years one of the most important fighter bases for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, or RNoAF, most recently operating F-16s . With the continued arrival of the F-35A stealth fighters , 52 of which are on order for Norway, the base today lost its fighter mission and the Joint Strike Fighter has assumed quick reaction alert (QRA) duties. While the military use of the airfield at Bodø dates back to before World War II, the base really came into its own with the start of the Cold War, thanks to its strategic position close to the border with the Soviet Union. The distance from Bodø to Russia’s massive naval base and port at Murmansk is just 500 miles, and with Norway becoming a founder member of NATO in 1949, work soon began to expand the airbase as a springboard for alliance airpower on the Northern Front. A CIA-operated U-2 carrying fictional National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) insignia and numbers in an effort to conceal its true mission. This photo was released in May 1960 after Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union during a CIA spy flight. An accompanying press release provided a cover story about a U-2 conducting weather research that may have strayed off course after the pilot reported difficulties with his oxygen equipment. , NASA Ultimately, a great deal of Bodø’s strategic value would come to be derived from its proximity to the Soviet Northern Fleet, which would eventually possess most of that country’s ballistic missile submarines and significant surface forces. Before then, however, the Soviet nuclear deterrent relied on manned bombers and early intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Since the first Soviet ICBMs still lacked the range to reach all potential targets in the United States, they had to be located in the far north of the Soviet Union, from where they would be launched on a polar trajectory. The first Soviet ICBM — in fact, the first anywhere in the world — was the R-7 Semyorka, known in the West as SS-6 Sapwood. It shared the same technology as the rocket that launched Sputnik 1, as well as the Vostok and Soyuz space-launch vehicles, among others . When the Soviets began to construct an operational launch site for SS-6 ICBMs at Plesetsk, near Arkhangelsk, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was understandably eager to learn more. A reconnaissance photograph taken by a U-2 showing an SS-6 Sapwood launch pad at the Tyuratum missile test center in Kazakhstan., National Security Archive The CIA’s attention turned to gathering aerial espionage with overflights by its U-2s over the northern reaches of the Soviet Union, and they requested the use of Bodø for this new mission. Norway agreed on the basis that these flights would not penetrate Soviet airspace. The CIA provided this guarantee, but, with Presidential approval, its U-2s were still able to conduct clandestine overflights of the Soviet Union. For now, though, the Norwegians were kept in the dark. As well as the ICBM base at Plesetsk, there were concerns that the Soviets were also rapidly improving their air defenses, which would make them better able to protect their northern frontiers against incursion by U.S. Air Force strategic bombers . A chief item of interest in this regard was the PRV-10M , or Patty Cake, a height-finding radar associated with the SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile. In 1958, the still highly classified U-2 was determined to be the best platform to discover more about Plesetsk and developments in Soviet ground-based air defenses. In addition to its array of optical cameras, the aircraft carried electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment that would be able to gather emissions from the Patty Cake system, while its high-altitude performance was expected to guarantee not only its safety but also more extensive coverage. Technicians load a type A-2 camera set into a U-2’s equipment bay. This camera configuration was used on the first U-2 Soviet overflight on July 4, 1956., U.S. Air Force Composite image showing elements of cameras similar to the A-2 set. Cameras used in the early U-2s were capable of photographing objects as small as two feet across from a height of more than 12 miles., U.S. Air Force By May 1958 the CIA had decided on a two-track approach for the northern U-2 missions from Bodø. One route would take the aircraft across the Barents Sea for overflights of Plesetsk, requiring Presidential authorization, while the other was less sensitive and would see the aircraft operating over international waters in the Gulf of Finland. To provide a cover story for the Norwegians, the CIA asserted that the U-2 missions were related to atmospheric sampling in the wake of Soviet nuclear tests taking place at Novaya Zemlya. In any event, this would turn out to be partly true, although weather reconnaissance was an early cover story for U-2 operations. It seems the Norwegians very likely understood that there was something more to the U-2 missions, despite reassurances they would not involve overflights. The head of military intelligence in Oslo, Col. Vilhelm Evang, was of the opinion that more information should be provided to explain any future such CIA missions. At the same time, the Americans also distrusted Evang, who some officials alleged was a communist. Despite reservations, the CIA launched Operation Baby Face in August 1958. A month later, the first of three U-2s involved in the mission touched down at Bodø and soon began local training flights. As well as the U-2s, a total of 16 or 17 transport aircraft — mainly U.S. Air Force C-130s — were also involved as support assets. Two operational flights took place over the Barents Sea in October 1958 but didn’t involve overflights. The first of these was genuinely used for sampling near Novaya Zemlya. The second was planned as an overflight, but had to be aborted after the CIA pilot noticed fuel was running low. However, by approaching close to Soviet airspace, the U-2 put Soviet air defenses on alert, with transmissions being picked up in turn by the Norwegians. Once again, Norwegian officials became concerned about the nature of the U-2 missions. The pilot of an early U-2s wearing an MC-3 partial pressure suit, worn underneath a standard flying coverall., U.S. Air Force By November, the weather was deteriorating, and the CIA decided to launch one last mission in the direction of Leningrad, with the aim of approaching as close to the city as was possible, while remaining in international airspace. With CIA pilot John Shinn at the controls, the U-2 launched from Bodø on Nov. 6, 1958, fitted with long-range fuel tanks that would allow it to fly all the way to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. The Norwegians were not informed of the departure. The spy plane was detected by Soviet radar when west of Pechenga on the Finnish-Soviet border. It then continued south through Finland, into the Gulf of Finland, and toward Leningrad. The U-2 then turned west again, through the Gulf of Finland and over the Baltic Sea. A map of key locations involved in Operation Baby Face. , GOOGLE EARTH Soviet air defense radar mistakenly identified the U-2 within its airspace in Estonia, leading to five MiG-19 Farmer interceptors being scrambled from their bases in Estonia and Latvia. The Soviet fighters topped out at 53,800 feet, leaving the U-2 unscathed at its perch of over 60,000 feet. The U-2 continued its mission, flying over West Germany, Italy, and Greece, before landing at Incirlik. The CIA later estimated that a total of 57 Soviet fighters were launched against Shinn’s aircraft at different points during the mission, providing a valuable ELINT windfall. A Soviet MiG-19 fighter of the type that tried to intercept the U-2 flight from Bodø on Nov. 6, 1958., U.S. Army While the November 6 flight brought good intelligence results, the fact that it was a CIA mission led to displeasure in the Air Force, which saw missions of this type and in this region as part of its remit. The Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed, even though Air Force U-2 missions were not permitted to overfly Soviet territory so were inevitably more limited in the intelligence they could target. As it was, the November 6 flight was the last by a U-2 involving Bodø until the ill-fated Powers mission of May 1, 1960. As is well known, that U-2 flight was fated never to reach its Norwegian destination. It was, of course, an SA-2 Guideline — one of the systems that Operation Baby Face hoped to discover more about — that blasted Powers’ U-2 out of the sky over Sverdlov. Francis Gary Powers (right) with U-2 designer Kelly Johnson in 1966 after Powers’ release by the Soviet Union. , U.S. Air Force The U-2 crisis of May 1960 saw relations between Oslo and Washington sour. As soon as it became clear that the CIA was using Bodø to fly over the Soviet Union, Norwegian officials requested that U.S. personnel supporting the missions leave the base. Such was the hurry for the CIA team to leave the installation that they departed, together with their equipment, using an available U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with only three working engines. Early U-2 testing at a remote dry lake in Nevada nicknamed “The Ranch.” Disassembled aircraft were airlifted in pieces from Lockheed’s Burbank, Calif., plant to the Ranch and assembled there. The Ranch is now known as Area 51., U.S. Air Force While overflights of the Soviet Union came to an end, the U-2 remained engaged on vital intelligence-gathering missions elsewhere in the world, a role in which it continues to excel to this day , despite more than one effort to retire it. In the years after the U-2 incident, Bodø served primarily as a fighter base for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, or RNoAF, although on at least two occasions it became an emergency landing site for SR-71 Blackbird spy planes . Successive generations of RNoAF fighters — F-84G Thunderjets, F-86 Sabres, F-104 Starfighters, F-5 Freedom Fighters — all served at the base, which would have been expected to host other NATO assets to protect the alliance’s northern flank in times of crisis. NATO funded infrastructure improvements at Bodø, including dozens of underground hangars to protect aircraft against Soviet attack. Meanwhile, the resident fighters kept a near-constant watch on Soviet military activities in the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea, frequently intercepting aircraft and shadowing naval maneuvers. Bodø’s fighter mission has now finally come to an end with the stand-down of the RNoAF’s F-16s at the base. From now on, air defense duties, including quick reaction alert (QRA), will be handled by the service’s F-35s. These will be stationed at Ørland, in central Norway, with a detachment at an advance base at Evenes in the north. In the future, Evenes will also host RNoAF P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft and will become a much more important installation as Norway continues to address the resurgent military threat posed by Russia. As for the F-16s, some of these have been snapped up by adversary air support contractor Draken International , while the Romanian Air Force has made moves to secure 32 of the others. A RNoAF on quick reaction alert duty at Bodø., Forsvaret From now on, the only regular military aircraft activities at Bodø will involve a small detachment of search-and-rescue Westland Sea King helicopters of the RNoAF. But with such a rich Cold War heritage behind it, and with the Norwegian Aviation Museum on the same site, the legacy of Bodø Air Base is unlikely to be forgotten. With thanks to Robert S Hopkins III, whose forthcoming book, Crowded Skies: Cold War Reconnaissance over the Baltic , provides more details of the U-2 operations from Bodø.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 18, 2021",British Frigate HMS Northumberland Hit A Russian Submarine With Its Towed Sonar In 2020,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has confirmed that a towed sonar array trailing behind the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland collided with a Russian Navy submarine in the North Atlantic Ocean two years ago. Both vessels were reportedly damaged in the incident, which appears to be the first of its kind, at least that we know about, since the end of the Cold War. The 2020 collision was first revealed in a recent episode of the television show Warship: Life At Sea , which is now in its third season on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom. The show, in general, offers a rare behind-the-scenes look at the day-to-day operations of an actual Royal Navy warship. The show is not readily available to viewers outside of the United Kingdom, but the second episode is said to include a segment where 5,400-ton-displacement Northumberland is described by British media outlets as a ‘playing a cat-and-mouse game’ with an unspecified Russian submarine. “Television footage captures the moment crew onboard HMS Northumberland sound the alarm, shouting ‘what the hell was that,’ ‘shit,’ ‘what the f*** have I just hit’ as the boat crashes into its towed array sonar,” according to a report from The Times newspaper in the United Kingdom. “It is believed to be the first time such an incident has been documented and made public,” that same story adds. This would appear, however, to only refer to incidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union. British and Soviet naval vessels, including submarines, are known to have hit each other during the Cold War . “In late 2020 a Russian submarine being tracked by HMS Northumberland came into contact with her towed array sonar,” the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in a statement given to multiple outlets . “The Royal Navy regularly tracks foreign ships and submarines in order to ensure the defense of the United Kingdom.” Northumberland is one of a number of Type 23 frigates that were retrofitted some years ago with the improved Type 2087 towed sonar array , which is a low-frequency active (LFAS) type, but which can be operated in active and passive modes. You can read more about how modern warships use towed and other types of sonar arrays to hunt for enemy submarines here . The exact circumstances of this incident are unknown. However, collisions involving submarines , even modern types with advanced sonars and other sensors, are hardly underhead of and can occur for a variety of reasons . The extent of the damage to either vessel is unclear. There are unconfirmed reports that Northumberland ‘s towed sonar array was rendered inoperable in the incident, forcing it to head to an unspecified port for repairs. An official Royal Navy press release regarding the frigate’s activities between September and December of 2020, at which time it was part of HMS Queen Elizabeth ‘s carrier strike group, also known as Carrier Strike Group 21 , makes no mention of the collision, nor the need to fix any damage. It does say the ship “stopped in Dundee, Lerwick and Faslane during her latest missions.” All of these locations are in Scotland. The Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group 21, with the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth at center., Crown Copyright At the time of writing, there does not appear to be any official statement from the Russian government regarding this incident. It seems very plausible that the Russian submarine in question was shadowing CSG21 and Queen Elizabeth , which is the Royal Navy’s current flagship. The first episode of season three of Warship: Life At Sea , which can be found online, as seen below, also involves a segment where Northumberland positions itself between a Russian intelligence-gathering ship and the carrier. https://youtube.com/watch?v=OVQBBdoxo-8 The disclosure of this incident follows years of U.K. military officials , as well as their counterparts in the United States , sounding the alarm about significant increases in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. In recent years, the Russian Navy has fielded a number of new, more modern, and quieter submarines that are much harder to spot and track. Russia’s deployment of new Project 885 Yasen and Project 885M Yasen-M nuclear guided-missile submarines have drawn particular attention from western military officials. U.S. Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck, who is head of U.S. Northern Command and the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command, told members of Congress last year that these boats were “on par with ours.” Cdr. Thom Hobbs, Northumberland ‘s commander officer, can be heard echoing similar sentiments in the first episode of season three of Warship: Life At Sea, as he tells his crew that they’ve been ordered to intercept a group of Russian surface vessels that appear to be heading toward CSG21. “The Russians who are deploying against us are as good as or better than us,” he says. The disclosure of this collision last year certainly underscores how real the tension, as well the potential danger, can be at the moment between British and Russian naval vessels operating in the region. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Frigates Navies Royal Navy Russian Navy Sea Submarines"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2020","Marine F-35Cs Begin First Carrier Deployment, Type Could Take On Larger Role In The Service","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The carrier variant of the stealthy Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35C , has deployed onboard an aircraft carrier for the first time in U.S. Marine Corps hands . While the Marines also operate the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B version , the service is procuring the C-model to ensure it can continue with the long-established TACAIR Integration agreement under which it provides squadrons to go aboard the Navy’s big-deck carriers. The addition of the carrier-going F-35C to the Marine Corps inventory also signals a significant boost to the service’s ability to confront high-end adversaries, especially in the Asia Pacific theater. The Marine Corps announced yesterday that Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the “Black Knights,” had departed San Diego Bay aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln ( CVN-72 ). In the process, VMFA-314 becomes the first Marine Corps squadron to deploy the F-35C on a flattop and only the second frontline F-35C squadron of any kind to go to sea. Part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW), the Black Knights are home-based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , California. Embarked on USS Abraham Lincoln , the squadron is now fully integrated as part of the Navy’s Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9). An F-35C assigned to VMFA-314 lands aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln during pre-deployment trials in the Pacific last November., U.S. Marine Corps/1st Lt. Charles Allen “The Black Knights’ deployment of the F-35C Lightning II aboard USS Abraham Lincoln is the newest chapter in the Marine Corps’ long history of naval integration,” said Maj. Gen. Bradford J. Gering, commanding general of the 3rd MAW. “The upcoming deployment represents years of hard work and innovation by the Marines and sailors of VMFA-314, MAG-11, and 3rd MAW. It also reinforces our commitment to fielding the most lethal and ready Navy-Marine Corps force as we project warfighting capabilities throughout the Indo-Pacific region, or globally wherever our nation calls.” “Our ability to operate the F-35C in the Pacific greatly increases the Marine Corps’ naval expeditionary force capabilities by providing us the capacity to employ the most advanced electronic warfare capabilities on any aircraft today in support of fleet operations,” added Lt. Col. Brendan M. Walsh, the VMFA-314 commanding officer. “In addition, having this asset available greatly increases the Marine Corps’ ability to provide security to our allied nations and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific.” VMFA-314 received its first F-35C in January 2020, the arrival of the new jets allowing the unit to retire its last F/A-18A/C ‘Legacy’ Hornets . Naval Air Systems Command then certified the Black Knights as safe for flight with the F-35C the following March, allowing the squadron to begin flight operations at Miramar. Since then, the Black Knights have conducted an extensive series of exercises and workups with the USS Abraham Lincoln and CVW-9. In one high-profile exercise, Summer Fury 21 , the 3rd MAW flew F-35Cs more than a thousand miles up the West Coast from Miramar to Washington State, demonstrating long-range precision strike. These kinds of missions are of particular relevance over the expanses of the Asia Pacific theater in which VMFA-314 and CVW-9 will be expected to operate. The Black Knights have also spent time working up aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln , culminating in a final integrated training cycle alongside other elements of Carrier Strike Group Three (CSG-3) in December. The strike group that departed San Diego also comprised the Ticonderoga class guided-missile cruiser USS Mobile Bay (CG-53), and the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 21 (DESRON 21): USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62), Gridley (DDG-101), Sampson (DDG-102), and Spruance (DDG-111). The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln transits San Diego Bay to begin its latest regularly scheduled deployment., U.S. Navy/MC1 Kelby Sanders For the Marine Corps, the F-35C represents a huge advance over the Legacy Hornets that previously constituted its TACAIR Integration capability, introducing a new era of low-observability and extensive networking capabilities. The final Marine Hornet carrier deployment concluded early last year, when the VMFA-323 “Death Rattlers” returned to Miramar after a mammoth 10-month deployment with CVW-17, embarked aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68). You can read about that milestone here . The first VMFA-314 F-35C flies with an F/A-18A++ from the same unit over the Sierras, in June 2019, during the transition from Hornet to Joint Strike Fighter., U.S. Navy/Lt. Cmdr. Darin Russell The current acquisition plan includes a total of 420 F-35s for the Marine Corps, 353 of these being STOVL F-35Bs and 67 being F-35Cs for operation aboard the Navy’s aircraft carriers, but it has been heavily implied that these numbers could change. The extended range provided by the F-35C, as well as the USMC’s shift away from traditional amphibious operations, could see the F-35C’s numbers grow. It’s also been stated at the highest level that the Marine Corps’ overall F-35 buy could decrease, which may lead to reformation of the mix of F-35Bs and Cs in the fleet. The F-35B and C carry the same basic air-to-air armament of up to four AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles ( AMRAAMs ) internally and two AIM-9X Sidewinders on launch rails mounted under the wingtips. However, the C-model’s larger weapons bays can also accommodate 2,000-pound-class weapons like the GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) internally, while the F-35B is restricted to the carriage of 1,000-pound-class weapons in its bays. The F-35C brings other advantages over the F-35B, including, in the future, the ability to carry the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER . This weapon is tailored to allow carrier air wings to operate more safely in areas containing advanced air-defense networks, another expected feature of Asia Pacific scenarios. The AARGM-ER is also optimized for carriage inside the F-35C’s weapons bays. An F/A-18F flies with an AARGM-ER missile during a captive-carry flight test at Patuxent River Air Station in Maryland. The Navy is integrating AARGM-ER on the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G, followed by the F-35C., U.S. Navy Having access to an anti-radiation weapon like the AARGM-ER means the F-35C can continue the defense-suppression mission previously flown by the Marine Corps’ now-retired EA-6B Prowler as well as the Hornet, both of which were provided with the earlier AGM-88 HARM weapon. Another weapon that was expected to be introduced to the F-35C is the stealthy AGM-154E Joint Stand-Off Weapon-Extended Range, or JSOW-ER . Originally scheduled for integration before the end of 2023, this was to provide a powerful extended-range strike capability, of the kind that is again relevant in the face of increasingly advanced integrated air defenses among potential opponents, including China. However, the U.S. Navy last year reversed its plans to field the JSOW-ER in favor of another type of stealthy cruise missile, a design related to the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extend Range, or JASSM-ER. The expectation had been that F-35Cs would be able to carry JSOW-ERs internally, allowing them to employ the weapons while flying in their stealthiest configuration, something they will not be able to do with the JASSM-ER. A development F-35C with a pair of JSOW missiles (plus AMRAAMs) in the internal weapons bays., U.S. Navy In terms of the current AGM-154C-1 JSOW, which allows the jet to engage moving maritime targets, this is planned for internal carriage in the F-35C, while the F-35B will be restricted to external carriage only. These internal weapons carriage capacity factors could also be a driver in a reformation of the mix of F-35Bs to Cs in the USMC’s future inventory. Electronic warfare (EW) is another area in which the F-35 offers capabilities that were beyond the reach of the Hornet. Under a developing concept of operations, both Marine Corps F-35B and C models will be expected to take on a portion of the EW mantle from the Prowler, using the AN/ASQ-239 electronic warfare suite to detect, locate, identify, and target threat emitters as well as share this data with other platforms. The AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar can also be used for electronic attack purposes. The jet also has other tricks up its sleeve in the EW department, and its full capability in this regard is still being explored. Ultimately, another three Marine Corps squadrons will receive F-35Cs, for a total of four carrier-capable squadrons that will be made available for integration with the Navy. Two squadrons will be stationed at Miramar, with the other pair on the East Coast at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. The priority, however, is the Pacific, with these two squadrons (VMFA-314, followed by VMFA-311) standing up in advance of those at Cherry Point (VMFA-115 and VMFA-251, starting in fiscal year 2024). Three F-35Cs from VMFA-314 prepare for takeoff in support of tailored ship’s training availability (TSTA) at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California, in June 2021., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Juan Anaya Because plans call for delivery of only 67 aircraft, the Marine Corps will not handle training on the F-35C in house, with Marines instead learning to operate the jet with the Navy fleet replacement squadron, the VFA-125 “Rough Raiders” at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, which include some Marine instructor pilots. As well as deploying operationally with carrier air wings, the Marine Corps also plans to use its F-35Cs in support of Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders in much the same way as it does with its F-35Bs. The ability to deploy squadrons, such as VMFA-314, “to key strategic maritime locations enables the Marine Corps the capability to deter adversarial aggression, and, if required, decisively win in conflict,” the service says. The Black Knights have already put short-field and austere operations capabilities to the test by deploying F-35Cs to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. You can read all about this capability and how it could add extra validity to an expanded F-35C cadre in the USMC in this previous exclusive of ours . Embracing the expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) concept for the F-35C means the Marine Corps has even greater flexibility, with these jets able to operate from remote airstrips with limited support, as well as from the decks of supercarriers. In both types of operations, the Marine Corps is continuing to refocus itself on conflicts with peer-states, especially in the Pacific, whether it’s hopping from island to island or operating at sea, the ability to go to war even if well-established infrastructure is not available has become increasingly important. It’s also worth noting that F-35Cs have now become fully integrated into the Navy’s Topgun schoolhouse, of which the Marine Corps is a part. Providing a whole new set of capabilities also means coming up with tactics to make the best use of them, conveying those tactics to crews, and providing threats that can actually challenge such a capable asset. You can read all about the F-35C’s game-changing presence in Topgun in this past feature of ours. Now that the Marine Corps’ Hornet has bowed out of the TACAIR Integration commitment, the service will be entirely reliant upon the F-35C for its carrier-deployed capability, eventually with four such squadrons compared to the current one. With the stealth jet, the Marine Corps will be provided with much-enhanced battlespace awareness as well as a platform that is far better suited to operations in the kinds of highly contested maritime environments that are likely to be encountered during future conflicts.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video went viral this week depicting a cuirass in a museum with a massive hole ripped directly through its chest. Based on the condition of the armor, the massive wound that resulted is hard to fathom in terms of severity. While people mostly wanted to debate the caption of the video on Twitter, which stated the soldier wearing the armor was “wounded,” historians have since chimed in on social media to provide a wealth of knowledge about the armor’s former owner, his life before the battle, and how he likely died at Waterloo. Here’s the whole story. The video, shared by Twitter user @TheFigen , shows a nearly 360-degree view of a brass and iron cuirass, or breastplate, worn by a soldier who fell at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. A grapefruit-sized entry hole is punched through the breastplate, while the backplate is violently ripped open by the exiting cannonball, opening it up nearly all the way across the other side of the soldier’s back. The cuirass is housed in the Musée de l’Armée (The Army Museum) in Paris, which houses a large collection of French military artifacts including uniforms, soldiers’ personal belongings, and weapons spanning from the 13th century to World War II. The cuirass is part of the museum’s sizeable Napoleonic war collection , which the facility calls “particularly remarkable.” According to Dr. Tony Pollard, a professor of conflict history and archeology at the University of Glasgow who has conducted fieldwork at Waterloo, the cuirass in the viral video was worn by François-Antoine Fauveau, a 23-year-old Caribinier a Cheval , or heavy cavalryman, serving in the Napoleonic Army’s 4th company, 2nd Carabinier Regiment. These carabiniers wore brass and iron armor over white tunics, with white leather riding pants and knee-high riding boots. The carabiniers’ primary weapons were swords, but they also carried a pair of pistols and a carbine — a lighter, shorter-barrelled form of the infantry musket. Myrabella/Wikicommons According to documents found on Fauveau after his death, the young man was a dairy farmer prior to the war and had a “long, freckled face with a large forehead, blue eyes, hooked nose, and a small mouth.” According to some accounts, the soldier was due to get married shortly before he was conscripted into Napoleon’s army. Pollard said Fauveau likely had less than seven days of military training before he was sent off to fight. A Belgian reenactment of the Battle of Waterloo in 2011., Public domain Fauveau’s time in the military would be cut short on June 18, 1815, at what would be the end of the Napoleonic Wars. On that date, self-proclaimed “Emperor of the French” Napoleon Bonaparte, having returned from exile from previous defeats, marched an army of around 72,000 soldiers to the village of Waterloo, south of Brussels in an attempt to catch British and allied forces, under Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, off guard. A brutal, day-long battle ensued, ending only after Prussian troops arrived late in the evening to flank the French, allowing British troops to drive Napoleon’s forces from the field. Some estimates put the total number of casualties at over 30,000 for the French forces and over 20,000 for the British and Prussian forces. The Battle of Waterloo by William Sadler, Public Domain The heavy casualties on both sides were largely due to advances in artillery weapons that occurred throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution made it much easier for forces on both sides to quickly manufacture weapons, and advances in heavy weaponry, largely driven by French innovations , made it easier to quickly deploy artillery on the battlefield or move it from location to location. Actors moving an artillery piece at a reenactment of the Battle of Waterloo., Wikimedia Commons Unfortunately, Antoine Fauveau would be one of the casualties struck down by a nine-pound cannonball during the Battle of Waterloo. Hopefully, the incredible damage inflicted to his breastplate meant he did not suffer long after the cannonball tore through his torso. While it can be easy to lose sight of the human cost of historical and ancient battles due to the distance we have from them, artifacts like this devastated cuirass help us remember there was a person behind each casualty figure and clearly spell out the brutal reality of Napoleonic warfare.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Star Wars Canyon, also known as Rainbow Canyon and figuratively by its official route name within the R-2508 aerial range complex that spans much of the Mojave Desert, the Jedi Transition, was once a Mecca for aviation photographers and low-flying military pilots alike . The thundering jet noise that once filled the picturesque crevasse along California’s Highway 190 has been largely silenced since a F/A-18 Super Hornet slammed into the canyon wall , killing its pilot and injuring nearby spotters, back in 2019. Since then, an altitude restriction of 1,500 feet above ground level was placed by the military on flights over the famous canyon. Yet today the jet noise returned, even if just briefly, as a Dassault Falcon 8X long-range business jet ripped through the canyon multiple times with an L-39 ‘Cinejet’ cameraship in tow. Our friend and ‘adventure’ aviation photographer extraordinaire, Christopher McGreevy, who goes by @ohwiss on Instagram (be sure to check out our full feature on McGreevy’s incredible flavor of aviation images), was on the scene and captured some amazing video of the bizarre and extremely rare spectacle: Here are the direct Facebook video links if the embedded videos don’t load above. He also took some stunning photos, previews of which can be seen below. We will update the post when he has fully processed the images. Christopher McGreevy Here is what McGreevy knows about the mission and a bit about his experience shooting it: “It was easily 20 passes in two sessions, in the AM and PM. I was told it’s going to be a promo video for the new jet. They flew the crew’s families out on it and they were on top of the hill watching. The kids and wives of the pilots were there. The jet flew into Inyokern Airport near China Lake from New Jersey.” The route of one of the photo sorties. , Flightaware.com/Google Maps The aircraft that was the star of the mission was a Falcon 8X manufactured in 2019 and flying under the registration N8X. It is owned by the Dassault Falcon Jet Corp and registered in Little Ferry, New Jersey. This appears to be the official regional sales office for Dassault . While military aircraft have been restricted from flying through the canyon, it appears that civilian aircraft can still do so. We have heard about small private aircraft doing it from time to time since the crash, but nothing like a long-range business jet blasting through it at high speed. Thanks to the Cinejet, which you can read all about in this past article of ours , we will likely get the most incredible video ever taken of an aircraft flying through the canyon, and there have been some pretty wild videos already. It is a real treat to see video and images like this again after years of nothing of the sort coming from the canyon. The fact that it will result in an unprecedented video in terms of angle and type of aircraft depicted is just icing on the cake. A huge thanks to Christopher McGreevy for sharing his experience with him. Make sure you follow him on Instagram here. UPDATE: Our friend @PaintingSurfer got some great shots of the Falcon’s canyon runs as well, check them out!: UPDATE: Here is the best video yet of the Falcon’s time in the canyon!: UPDATE: The shoot was to show off the 8X’s agility for a promotional video. The aircraft is relocating to Los Angeles for demonstration flights for prospective buyers of the type. The price of a Falcon 8X is around $60M , but obviously, things can go way up from there depending on what an owner wants to do with the interior. Author’s note: Changed the Falcon’s designation from 7X to 8X. The aircraft is registered as a 7X, but apparently, this 7X is a demonstrator for the 8X, which is a direct outgrowth variant of the 7X.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2021",Boeing Reveals New Hypersonic Aircraft Model Evolved From Previous Valkyrie Concept (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has unveiled a new model of a proposed reusable hypersonic aircraft at a conference this week. The design is an evolution of concepts that were first displayed publicly four years ago and could potentially have military and commercial applications, including as a space launch mothership , according to the company. Aviation Week Senior Editor Guy Norris spotted the model at the annual AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition in San Diego, California, which opened on Monday and will wrap up on Friday, and posted pictures of it on Twitter. There is little hard information about it so far, but The War Zone has already reached out to Boeing for details. On Twitter, Aviation Week ‘s Norris said that the design was an evolution of a concept that Boeing had unveiled at the 2018 SciTech Forum. It is “a refined, more realistic Mach 5 reusable air-breathing design targeting military and space launch roles,” he explained. Mach 5 is the accepted threshold for hypersonic speed. The model Boeing has at its booth at the 2021 SciTech Forum has some very general similarities in its overall planform with the one it displayed in 2018, the latter of which is seen in the video below, but the new design is significantly different in many respects. It has a flatter central fuselage, as well as shorter wings and twin tails. The positioning of two engines underneath the fuselage has been changed, with them now being contained inside two distinct fairings rather than side-by-side. Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor Steve Trimble also noted that there is a conspicuous gap between the mold line of the forward fuselage and where the wing root starts on either side, despite them looking like they might be supposed to be aligned. It is unclear if this is simply a product of how the model was made or if it actually reflects a true aspect of the design. It’s not clear what kind of engines Boeing might expect to power this aircraft, but the company has explored various advanced high-speed jet engines in the past, including scramjets and so-called “combined cycle” concepts. A turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) engine configuration pairs traditional jet turbines with ramjets or scramjets. Ramjets and scramjets simply do not work optimally, or even at all, at lower speeds, so the other turbines would be used for flight in those speed regimes. Viable TBCC engine arrangements are highly complex and are considered by some as a holy grail technology when it comes to designing viable reusable hypersonic aircraft that can take off and land using existing runway infrastructure. We don’t know what exactly prompted Boeing to debut its updated hypersonic aircraft concept now. The company’s unveiling of its hypersonic concept at the AIAA event in 2018, which was dubbed Valkyrie , was seen as a response from the company to Lockheed Martin’s unusually public pitching at the time of its own proposed advanced hypersonic military aircraft called the SR-72. The SR-72 was billed as a potential spiritual successor to Lockheed’s SR-71 Blackbird supersonic spy plane that could also carry out strike missions. The appearance of Boeing’s hypersonic aircraft model at the AIAA conference interestingly follows the Air Force’s release of more information about Project Mayhem . Details about this effort are still limited, but it is becoming clear that the core focus is on the development of hypersonic aircraft capable of performing strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as you can read more about here . Of course, Boeing has a long history of interest in such designs for various applications, including as high-speed airliners and as platforms to conduct different kinds of military missions. This is not the first time Boeing has explored the idea of a reusable hypersonic platform for launching payloads into space , as an alternative to traditional space launch rockets, either. An artist’s conception of a notional hypersonic airliner that Boeing first put out in 2018., Boeing In 2017, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hired Boeing to develop a reusable hypersonic spaceplane, designated the XS-1 , However, that particular program was canceled in 2020. It is all but certain that work on similar concepts is being done in the classified realm , as well. Existing and emerging threats to U.S. government assets in space are continuing to drive a surge in interest in novel ways to rapidly get payloads into orbit to help replace damaged or destroyed satellites in a crisis. In March 2021, the Australian branch of Boeing’s Research & Technology division announced that it had entered into a partnership with Hypersonix Launch Systems , also based in that country, to work on the development of what was described as a “sustainable hypersonic vehicle.” This aircraft would use Hypersonix’s SPARTAN scramjet engines and be capable of serving as a space launch mothership. Various other firms, such as aerospace startup Hermeus , have been working on their own hypersonic aircraft concepts in recent years, again with eyes toward both military and commercial aviation sales. We will certainly be interested to learn more about Boeing’s latest, refined hypersonic aircraft concept and what its specific plans for the design might be. Update 1/6/2022: Boeing has provided the following brief statement to The War Zone regarding this new hypersonic aircraft concept: Boeing has been developing a hypersonic reusable aircraft design concept that could support various Department of Defense military applications. This concept model was shown at the AIAA SciTech Forum in San Diego. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Civil Aviation News & Features"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2022",Russian-Led ‘Peacekeeping Force’ To Deploy To Kazakhstan In Response To Unrest,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nikol Pashinyan, the Prime Minister of Armenia and the chairman of the Collective Security Treaty Organization’s Collective Security Council, has announced that this bloc, in which Russia is the most powerful player, is preparing to send a “peacekeeping” force to Kazakhstan . This will be the first time this international organization has launched a military intervention of any kind as part of its collective security provisions. Massive unrest erupted in parts of that Central Asian country today after unprecedented protests against the country’s authoritarian government that were touched off by a steep hike in subsidized fuel prices. There are already indications that Kazakh authorities are engaging in violent crackdowns on demonstrators in a number of major cities. Armed riot police in the Kazakh city of Almaty on Jan. 5, 2022., AP Photo/Vladimir Tretyakov Pashinyan made the announcement about the planned intervention by the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) via his official Facebook account earlier this evening. In a machine translation of the language post, seen below, which is in Armenian and Russian, he says the decision was made to send “peacekeeping forces to the Republic of Kazakhstan for a limited period of time to the situation in the country for the purpose of stability and regulation.” The Armenian Prime Minister offered no further details about the composition of this force or how it will be employed. There are unconfirmed reports that Russian troops, including paratroopers and special operations units, will at least be among the contingents deployed. The CSTO currently has six members: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Since 2009, the bloc has had a standing Collective Rapid Reaction Force (CRRF), made up of designated contingents from its various member states, that is intended to be deployed upon request to combat various external and internal threats. CSTO CRRF drills, including those conducted as recently as last fall , have included a full range of military assets, including combat aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles, as well as special operations forces. The CSTO has refused to act in response to all previous requests for assistance from member states, of which there have been at least two. The first came from Kyrgyzstan after major unrest erupted there in 2012 and the second came from Armenia after a major conflict broke out between it and Azerbaijan last year. Russia did deploy a peacekeeping force along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border after brokering a deal that brought the fighting to end in that case, but outside of the CSTO framework. So it was unclear whether the bloc would actually respond when Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev, who has been President of Kazakhstan since 2019,  made a formal appeal for help in dealing with what he described as a “terrorist” threat in his country earlier today. This followed the declaration of a state of emergency in many parts of the country, including in the capital Nur-Sultan, known as Astana until 2019 when it was renamed after longtime former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest metropolitan area. Protesters had earlier attacked and set fire to numerous government buildings, including the president’s residence in Nur-Sultan. There were also reports that they had taken control of the airport in Almaty for at least a time. Toqaev, a member of the country’s ruling Nur Otan political party, had earlier tried, and failed, to quell the growing unrest by publicly accepting the resignation of his cabinet and officially stripping Nazarbayev of his powerful role as Chairman of the Security Council. Kazakh authorities had also promised to work to ease the fuel price increases. A list of demands circulating online, reportedly from an entity referring to itself as the People’s Committee of Kazakhstan, included a call for the resignation of the Toqaev and the rest of the current government, among other things. It is unclear whether this list represents any sort of real coordinated push on the part of protesters across the country, but does appear to reflect a number of simmering grievances among average citizens. Though the country remains under a major internet and communications blackout, a number of videos have since emerged online where large amounts of gunfire can be heard. Others reportedly show bodies of protesters killed in what increasingly appear to be brutal crackdowns in various cities by Kazakh security forces. It is virtually impossible to independently verify any of this footage at present and the overall situation in the country, by every indication, remains highly fluid. Kazakhstan’s Interior Ministry earlier said that eight police officers and members of the country’s national guard had died in clashes with protesters, and that 300 other security forces personnel had been injured, but offered no figures regarding civilian casualties. It is certainly possible that the CSTO peacekeeping force that is now being readied according to Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan could find itself directly involved in breaking up any continued demonstrations. At the same time, they could also help restore order and otherwise guard critical infrastructure, such as Almaty’s airport, freeing up Kazakhstan’s own forces to help support ongoing crackdowns. Russia, of all of the CSTO members, probably has the greatest interest in seeing stability, if not the prior status quo, return to Kazakhstan. The government in Kazakhstan, which was a part of the Soviet Union until 1991, remains a major partner of the Kremlin’s on a wide range of issues. The Central Asian country still hosts a Russian test range at Sary Shagan that is used primarily used today to support work on anti-ballistic missile systems , which can double as anti-satellite weapons , as well as Russia’s main space launch facility at Baikonur . https://youtube.com/watch?v=NeoLBQQpXZU https://youtube.com/watch?v=icu6VM_LlvQ Beyond all this, Kazakhstan occupies an important geostrategic position between Russia and western China , as well as just being the largest country by area in Central Asia. This part of the world has drawn renewed international attention , in general, following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, with which Kazakhstan does not share a border, in August 2021. At the same time, Russia’s ability, or desire, to contribute to an extended mission in Kazakhstan may be limited. The Kremlin is otherwise preoccupied with a campaign to at least put pressure on the government of Ukraine with large-scale military deployments along its borders with that country. In fact, many of the units based in central Russia that one might expect to be on call for operations in Kazakhstan are actually now deployed further west. In addition, Russian forces have been deployed to Belarus ostensibly for training exercises on multiple occasions in recent months amid a border crisis involving that country , which is a major Russian ally. Russia and Belarus stepped up joint drills back in 2020 in what appeared to some observers and experts as an indirect way to deploy forces to bolster the regime of the latter country’s dictatorial President Alexander Lukashenko who was facing major protests at the time. Regardless of what its direct contributions to the CSTO mission ultimately look like, the bloc’s intervention does signal support from Russia, as well as the other CSTO members, for the current Kazakh government. These could be very important endorsements for President Toqaev as he looks to ensure continued loyalty to his regime, especially from the country’s security forces. “We are closely following the events in the fraternal neighboring state,” a statement from Russia’s Foreign Ministry earlier today read. “We are calling for a peaceful solution to all problems in the framework of the Constitution and the law, and dialogue, and not through street riots and the violation of laws.” What impact this impending deployment of a CSTO peacekeeping contingent will now have on the civil unrest of Kazakhstan very much remains to be seen.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Jan 27, 2022",Air Force’s Small Telescope Tech Will Help Detect Enemy Satellites Sneaking Up On Friendly Ones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Previously classified adaptive optics technologies enabled the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to capture an image of an asteroid’s moon using a telescope measuring just 1.5 meters across. The ability to detect and capture images of space-based objects without the need for massive telescopes could aid in the Pentagon’s efforts to track small, maneuverable satellites in close proximity to one another — an increasingly critical capability as space becomes a major battleground. The images of the moon were captured at the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. The small moon, known as Linus, measures around 30 km in diameter and orbits the asteroid 22 Kalliope at a distance of around 1100 km every 3.6 days. The asteroid and its moon are found in the main belt of asteroids which stretches between Mars and Jupiter. The 1.5m telescope is only one of several telescopes at the base, all of which are claimed by AFRL to be capable of tracking satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). Lasers being fired into space at the Starfire Optical Range., Public domain In an AFRL press release , Starfire Optical Range astronomer Tanya Tavenner said she “couldn’t believe we imaged a moon around an asteroid with such a small telescope,” and credited the milestone to the engineering skills of Dr. Odell Reynolds, a senior engineer at the range. Another Starfire Optical Range scientist, Dr. Mala Mateen, said the milestone shows that smaller telescopes could be used in the future to produce high-contrast images of objects close together in space. Kalliope, left, and Kalliope and Linus, right. Linus appears as a small red object under Kalliope, center., AFRL The key technology enabling this milestone is known as adaptive optics , a system that enables scientists to reduce the blurring or distortion caused by atmospheric interference when viewing objects in space. There are a few different types of adaptive optics in use, ranging from using deformable mirrors that can ‘cancel out’ atmospheric interference to using lasers to project artificial “guide stars” that can be used as reference points to measure and subsequently reduce atmospheric interference. AFRL did not state which particular adaptive optic system was used in the recent imaging of Linus but did say that the images were made without the use of a laser guide star. Adaptive optics technologies were pioneered during the Cold War as the United States sought new methods of tracking Soviet satellites in space. For two decades, much of the research the Air Force conducted on adaptive optics was classified but was revealed to the public in the early 1990s. According to Robert Duffner, author of The Adaptive Optics Revolution: A History , adaptive optics was “part of the strategic defense thinking of the nation, of what we could do to get better images of what was out in space.” Duffner told NPR’s Joe Palca in 2013 that the U.S. Air Force was interested in the technology mainly to get clearer images of satellites and missiles, but there was another use the Air Force eyed for the technology. Scientists at Kirtland AFB had the idea of putting mirrors in space that could reflect the beams from powerful ground-based or airborne lasers to destroy satellites in orbit or ballistic missiles in flight. As in astronomical imaging, the Earth’s atmosphere distorts laser beams as they pass through it. Adaptive optics, such as deformable mirrors driven by sophisticated software, were proposed for re-organizing these distorted laser beams into coherent ones that could be reflected at airborne or space-based targets. An untested ground-based laser relay concept published by Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in 1998., USAF Like many ambitious defense projects of the late Cold War period, the space mirror idea never got off the ground, but the adaptive optics methods developed alongside the concept have gone on to become hugely valuable tools for astronomers to more clearly see objects in space. Other big-name facilities or technologies used in astronomy, such as the now-defunct Arecibo Radio Telescope, in Puerto Rico, also began their lives as defense projects . In addition, adaptive optics has been a decisive factor in making laser weapons more feasible . The once-classified Starfire Optical Range still conducts secretive satellite tracking and anti-satellite work in addition to its public work in astronomy. According to an AFRL fact sheet, the site facility “operates one of the world’s premier telescopes capable of tracking low-earth orbiting satellites.” Dr. Jack Drummond, a Starfire astronomer, says that refining advanced imaging methods such as those used to view 22 Kalliope’s moon, Linus, could help not only in viewing celestial objects but also in detecting satellites in Earth’s orbit. “The reason we even look at the asteroids at the [Starfire Optical Range] is because they are a good proxy for manmade satellite observations,” Drummond told the Albequerque Journal last year. “Nobody wants to be near each other’s satellites. We can’t tell two satellites to get together. Instead, we look at asteroids and their moons. It’s a perfect analogy, a perfect proxy.” Tracking smaller, more maneuverable satellites in low-Earth orbit has become a priority for the Pentagon as attacks on American satellites have ramped up in recent years. Late last year, Space Force’s second in command, Gen. David Thompson, stated that America’s space assets are under attack “every single day” from electronic warfare and directed-energy attacks. The optical technologies used at Kirtland very well could fit into the Space Force’s mission of protecting American satellites from space-based threats. Telescopes that can detect small adversary-controlled satellites in close proximity to U.S.-operated satellites will be an essential situational awareness and early warning capability aimed at defending American satellites against attacks, both destructive and non-destructive. There have already been incidents in which foreign-controlled satellites have maneuvered dangerously close to U.S. assets or conducted tests of weapons. In one example in 2019, a small Russian satellite fired a projectile in an on-orbit test. Space Force’s Gen. David Thompson later said the Russian satellite “maneuvered threateningly so that they were coming close enough that there was a concern of collision,” adding: “Clearly, the Russians were sending us a message.” Both Russia and China have tested small, highly mobile satellites billed as “inspector satellites.” While these so-called inspectors certainly could be capable of performing their stated task, they also could easily maneuver alongside an American satellite and physically tamper with it , slam into it, or even jostle it out of orbit. DARPA has researched similar satellite concepts known as robotic servicing vehicles , or RSVs. Aside from physical attacks or projectiles, small satellites are currently capable of enacting a variety of directed energy attacks including high-powered microwaves and blinding lasers, radiofrequency jamming attacks, or even spraying chemicals that could disrupt a satellite’s operation. Clearly, tracking adversaries’ “ killer satellites ” and protecting U.S. ones is a primary Space Force mission, one that will only continue to become more vital to U.S. national security. A DIA infographic depicting various ways satellites can attack one another in space., DIA With so many satellites to defend, Space Force is already investing in newer, smaller telescopes that can track objects in space even in daylight. It’s possible that a network of similar small telescopes equipped with some of the technology deployed at the Starfire Optical Range could provide critical early warning and tracking surveillance of potentially marauding satellites on a persistent basis. While the introduction of distributed satellite constellations, similar to Starlink , will make some satellite-based capabilities more resilient, they too will be targets and anti-satellite capabilities will adapt to counter them as well. In other words, the need to track small maneuverable satellites of nefarious origin operating in close proximity of other satellites — where they should not be — isn’t going to go away anytime soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 29, 2021",North Korea Claims It Successfully Tested A New ‘Hypersonic Gliding Warhead’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea has posted an image of what it says was a test of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle that occurred yesterday. North Korea had claimed to have first tested a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle last September , and it showed off what appeared to be the same weapon, dubbed the Hwasong-8, at an elaborate arms expo that took place in Pyongyang last October. This latest test is of another new missile that was displayed at that show for the first time and that North Korean officials say has a different glide vehicle design. All of this underscores that Kim Jong Un’s regime appears to be seriously intent on developing a hypersonic weapon capability. Speculation that the latest North Korean test launch was of a hypersonic weapon system came shortly after news came that it occurred. The location of its origin and target area were similar to those observed in the September test. North Korea state news furnished the following release along with the image of the launch, it states in part: In the test launch the academy reconfirmed the flight control and stability of the missile in the active-flight stage and assessed the performance of the new lateral movement technique applied to the detached hypersonic gliding warhead. Having been detached after its launch, the missile made a 120 km lateral movement in the flight distance of the hypersonic gliding warhead from the initial launch azimuth to the target azimuth and precisely hit a set target 700 km away. The reliability of fuel ampoule system under the winter weather conditions was also verified. The test launch clearly demonstrated the control and stability of the hypersonic gliding warhead, which combined the multi-stage gliding jump flight and the strong lateral movement. North Korea provided a remarkable amount of detail in its statement and in doing so claimed a high degree of mastery over hypersonic boost-glide vehicle technologies. How much of it is true is very much up for debate without having access to classified intelligence collected by South Korea, the U.S., and Japan. Regardless, hypersonic weapons technology is extremely challenging, both from an aerospace design and material science point of view. That being said, while it may seem quite reaching that North Korea could realize a successful hypersonic boost-glide vehicle capability any time soon, it’s worth remembering that those that discounted the regime’s race to realize an ICBM were proven quite wrong and in relatively short order . It’s also worth noting that the glide vehicle used in the January 5th, 2021 test is significantly different from the one shown in the September 2021 test and later at the arms expo a month later. This one is cone-shaped (conical), while the other was more of a wedge-shaped lifting body design. The latter of the two shapes have been used by China’s DF-17 and Russia’s Avangard systems . The U.S. Army and Navy, on the other hand, have largely focused on a common conical-shaped vehicle to accelerate the delivery of hypersonic boost-glide vehicle capabilities, with the idea that it would continue to develop more challenging wedge-shaped designs and procure them at a later date. North Korea’s Hwasong-8 wedge-shaped hypersonic boost-glide vehicle weapon as seen at the Pyongyang arms expo in October. , KCNA There is also a possibility that this conical vehicle is actually just an advanced maneuverable re-entry vehicle, or MaRV, of some kind. MaRVs are typically defined as having a much lower degree of maneuverability than a true hypersonic boost-glide vehicle and as being more locked into a broadly ballistic trajectory. Their motion in the terminal phase of flight is often referred to as a “porpoise” or “skip-glide” trajectory and involves at least one pull-up maneuver, creating one or more downward “steps.” These irregular movements can still present challenges for defenders, as well as be used as a way to make course corrections for greater accuracy and potentially extend the range of the warhead. Most importantly in the context of North Korea’s description of this test, a MaRV is traveling at hypersonic speeds at the endgame point in its flight. Beyond the warhead, that this missile is said to be liquid-fueled and has a so-called “ampulized” rocket booster are significant details. Ampulization is a Soviet-era term that refers to liquid fuel rocket motors that are sealed at the factory and are therefore much easier and safer to handle. They can also be kept in a fueled state for protracted periods of time, unlike typical liquid-fueled designs, making it simpler to deploy and fire them relatively quickly, reducing their vulnerability to pre-emptive strikes. Whatever the true capabilities of this new missile might be, hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, including those with limited range, are ideally suited for North Korea’s strategic needs. The hypersonic boost-glide vehicle is immune to any air and missile defenses deployed to the South, or in the entire region, for that matter. As such, they could strike high-value targets with impunity, at least for now . Still, the idea of acquiring this capability is one thing, overcoming the major technological hurdles and paying the large costs needed to do so is another. On the other hand, a MaRV would be more attainable, but less survivable. Regardless, Pyongyang seems quite serious about developing a hypersonic weapons capability and it is an area that draws less international alarm than continuing to refine its ICBM capabilities via test flights. Time will tell if they can actually achieve it.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2021",Korean F-35 Fighters Grounded After ‘Major Systems Malfunction’ Leads To Belly Landing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea has grounded its fleet of F-35A stealth fighters , pending a full investigation into an accident yesterday, in which one of the jets was forced to make a belly landing during a training mission. The pilot was uninjured, but initial accounts suggest that the emergency was caused by a “major systems malfunction” that prevented the landing gear from being deployed. Defense ministry sources in Seoul confirmed the grounding order today, an unnamed defense official stating that “with the investigation underway, the entire [F-35] fleet is suspended from flying.” Earlier reports had spoken of “avionics system issues,” although the latest wording sounds, at least superficially, to suggest a more comprehensive problem onboard the jet. The jet is one of at least 30 examples of the type to have been delivered to Korea to date. A Republic of Korea Air Force F-35A pilot prepares for a training mission at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Louis Vega Jr. Shin Ok-chul, the vice chief of staff of the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF), meanwhile told a parliamentary hearing that the F-35 had been flying at low altitude when the pilot heard a series of bangs, prompting him to check the aircraft’s systems. “All systems had stopped working except flight controls and the engine,” Shin said, at which point the pilot made the decision to remain with the aircraft and attempt a belly landing at Seosan Air Base in the western province of South Chungcheong, at 12:51 PM local time on Jan. 4. Alerted to the emergency, firefighters at the base doused the runway with foam, to reduce the risk of fire when the jet touched down. So far, however, there is no indication of the extent of the damage sustained, and no photos of the incident have become available. It’s not clear currently if the jet was operating from Seosan Air Base at the time of the incident, or whether it recovered there while flying from its home station of Cheongju, in the central province of North Chungcheong. The locations of Seosan and Cheongju Air Bases., GOOGLE EARTH As far as is known, this is the first time a belly landing has been attempted in a Joint Strike Fighter. Emergency recovery is a challenge for any aircraft, but is not entirely uncommon, especially for high-performance fighters . However, in the case of the F-35, or other stealth designs, a belly landing can be particularly problematic given the sensitive nature of their coatings and the tight tolerances of their construction. On the other hand, even the results of a stealth fighter skidding along a runway can be made good, as evidenced by the recent completion of the effort to return a seriously damaged U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor to service. However, the process can be long — nearly four years in the F-22 example — and costly. The grounding order is not surprising given the apparent nature of the problems that the pilot faced before the belly landing, and it’s clear that the ROKAF will want to know exactly what was responsible for what sounds like a significant systems anomaly. The ROKAF has invested heavily in modernizing its fleet with the stealth jet. Despite the cost, the ROKAF determined that a fifth-generation type was required to counter China’s stealth developments and have the capability to penetrate North Korean airspace at a time of escalating military tensions with its neighbor. Selected under the third phase of its long-running fighter procurement program, or F-X, Seoul is investing around $7 billion to acquire 40 examples of the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A variant. A Letter of Offer and Acceptance between the South Korean and U.S. governments was signed in September 2014, with plans for another 20 of the jets to be purchased at a later date. The first F-35A for the ROKAF was rolled out at Lockheed Martin’s facility in Fort Worth, Texas, in March 2018, and the first pair of jets arrived at Cheongju Air Base in March 2019. Initial operating capability was declared before the end of the same year. At the same time, the fact that Seoul operates multiple types of fighters means that other fleets are still available to meet routine ROKAF requirements and respond to contingencies. These jets include 60 multirole F-15K Slam Eagles , advanced versions of the F-15E Strike Eagle , and the survivors of 180 F-16C/Ds originally delivered. Seoul is now in the process of upgrading 134 of its Vipers to the F-16V standard , with new avionics including an AESA radar. As well as these more modern jets, the ROKAF still flies smaller numbers of aging F-4E Phantom II and F-5E/F Tiger II fighters, plus tactically roled FA-50 jets derived from the T-50 trainer . Prior to the South Korean incident, the most recent accident involving a Joint Strike Fighter saw a British Royal Air Force F-35B plunging into the Mediterranean during takeoff from the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth . The pilot ejected safely, and you can read more about that incident here . Landing incidents involving F-35s are by no means unheard of. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force has reportedly made at least seven emergency landings in F-35As, in addition to a fatal accident in April 2019. In a May 2020 incident at Eglin Air Force Base, an F-35A crashed while landing due to a combination of factors . Other U.S. Air Force F-35As have suffered nose-gear collapses on landing, at Eglin Air Force Base in August 2018 and at Hill Air Force Base in Utah in June 2020. A ROKAF fighter pilot (left) stands near an F-35A during an event marking Armed Forces Day at Daegu Air Base, South Korea, October 2019., Jeon Heon-kyun/Pool Photo via AP The outcome of the investigation into yesterday’s belly-landing incident will be keenly awaited not just by the ROKAF but the wider F-35 operating community, as the delivery total hits the 750-aircraft mark . For South Korea, there remains the option of acquiring another 20 CTOL F-35As, valued at around $3.3 billion, while future plans also envisage orders for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B variants of the Lightning II, to equip its forthcoming aircraft carriers . With this in mind, officials will be especially eager to determine whether the incident was a one-off or a symptom of a more systemic issue. We will provide updates on this story as soon as further information about the incident becomes available.

This rifle is a variant of the Barrett Multi-Role Adaptive Design (MRAD) precision rifle developed specifically for the U.S. special operations community. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) chose this version of the MRAD as the winner of its Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR) competition in 2019. The ASR program, which was first announced in 2017 , sought to acquire a rifle featuring modular parts that could be easily and rapidly reconfigured to fire either 7.62x51mm NATO, .300 Norma Magnum, or .338 Norma Magnum ammunition as necessary. Barrett MRAD is a modular design that the company offers for sale to civilian and government customers, in eight different calibers in total, as well as in a host of different configurations. SOCOM’s Mk 22s come with Nightforce 7-35×56 scopes and Barrett’s own AML 338 suppressors and have various accessory attachment points for additional aiming devices and other accessories, among other features. SOCOM’s decision to adopt a version of the MRAD came relatively soon after it had fielded another new sniper rifle, known as the Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR). Those rifles, a variant of the Remington Modular Sniper Rifle (MSR) also known as the Mk 21 Mod 0, were designed to fill the same general role as the ASR and could be converted to any of the same three calibers. The MSR had notably beaten out the MRAD in the PSR competition in 2013. For reasons that are still not entirely clear, SOCOM subsequently decided to curtail purchases of the Mk 21 Mod 0, and launch the ASR competition. Remington again submitted an MSR-based rifle, but then lost to Barrett’s entry. The Remington MSR., Wikimedia Commons The U.S. Army has since made a similar decision to adopt its own variant of the MRAD to replace its own Remington sniper rifles, from which the MSR was derived and that are designed M2010s. The configuration of the rifles that conventional Army snipers will eventually receive is expected to be slightly different, including using a different scope made by Leupold .

Its creation followed a series of unprecedented cruise missile and drone attacks in September that year, linked to Iran, that targeted two major oil-related sites in the Kingdom. Before the end of 2019, Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters and B-1B Lancer bombers , and U.S. Army Patriot missile batteries had all spent time at Prince Sultan.

This administration has otherwise taken a more circumspect approach to its dealings with Riyadh, chiefly due to human rights concerns , including in the conflict in Yemen. Since the establishment of the base, tensions between Iran, the United States, and U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East have not gone away, although there has still been a drawdown of American forces from the region. This has affected Iraq, in particular, where around 2,500 U.S. troops remain in a mainly advisory capacity . At the same time, however, the IRGC continues to wage a campaign of attacks on commercial oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and has seized oil tankers in the strategic Strait of Hormuz. A Marine from the VMFA-115 marshals in an F/A-18 at Prince Sultan Air Base., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jacob B.

Only yesterday, the Houthis seized an Emirati-flagged vessel in the Red Sea, which had been carrying a Saudi military cargo from the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. At the same time, the Houthis have kept up a campaign of drone and missile attacks against civilian targets, launched into Saudi Arabia from neighboring Yemen. At the end of last year, American and Saudi officials stated that the Houthi drone and missile onslaught against the Kingdom comprised almost a dozen ballistic missile and drone strikes on Saudi territory each week, a considerable uptick compared to 2020. Indeed, such is the tempo of these attacks that Saudi Arabia has begun to run low on its stocks of missile rounds for its U.S.-supplied Patriot air-defense systems and the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs, that arm its fighter jets . Hornets from the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 115 on the flight line at Prince Sultan., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jacob B. Wrightsman As for the jets that VMFA-115 has brought to PSAB, these are a mixture of single-seat F/A-18C and twin-seat F/A-18D versions, reflecting the shift to â€˜compositeâ€™ squadrons that the service introduced a few years ago, and which we covered exclusively at the time . As we have also discussed in the past, these jets are still very capable despite their age , having undergone various upgrades. These are set to continue, to ensure the Legacy Hornet remains on the Marine Corps front line until 2030. An F/A-18D lands at Prince Sultan Air Base., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jacob B. Wrightsman The arrival of Marine Corps Hornets in Saudi Arabia reflects the continued role of the 378th AEW to signal U.S. military intent and capabilities and to respond to regional contingencies as soon as they develop. With tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran â€” and Iranian proxies â€” showing no signs of abating, the VMFA-115 deployment is unlikely to be the last of its kind, as part of what is now a long-term U.S. military presence at Prince Sultan Air Base.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Feb 3, 2020",Air Force Releases List Of What’s In Its Famous ‘Petting Zoo’ Threat Training Facility,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has issued a request for information , or RFI, pertaining to its plans to move the Nellis Threat Training Facility — or “Petting Zoo” — at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nev., to a new part of the base under construction. As part of the request, the Air Force has published a list of equipment housed at the facility, offering a rare glimpse into the wide range of foreign weapons technologies the U.S. Air Force possesses for training and education. The Threat Training Facility (TTF) is operated by the 547th Intelligence Squadron , which specializes in adversary tactics and threat analysis and conducts advanced Red Flag exercises. The five-acre TTF features a range of small arms, artillery and armor, surface-to-air weapons systems, electronic warfare and radar platforms , and even foreign-made aircraft from former Warsaw Pact nations, such as a MiG-29 Fulcrum , a MiG-23 Flogger , and an Su-7 Fitter . All of these assets will be moved less than a mile to a new structure being constructed southwest of the current facility. The Air Force wants all the equipment moved by Sept. 28, 2022, according to the RFI documents . A full list of the equipment that will be moved to the new facility at Nellis can be read below: USAF PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT For 547 INTELLIGENCE SQUADRON EQUIPMENT MOVEDownload The TTF at Nellis was classified for much of its life but was revealed to the public in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the USSR. It has been rumored that American intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely visited the site for hands-on training with foreign materiel. While many of the systems at the site date back to the Cold War, many are still in use by foreign nations, such as the MiG-29s used by Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Interestingly, one U.S.-made system appears on the list: the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile system. The Hawk still happens to be in at least some level of service in Iran (which also makes an indigenous derivative ), among other places. An intelligence analyst with the 547th Intelligence Squadron briefs visitors on a MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile system., USAF Some of the ‘exhibits’ at the facility were acquired by the United States from defectors seeking asylum, while others were captured by U.S. forces or obtained via allies who seized them from adversary nations during conflicts. Others came from former Soviet states following the collapse of the USSR. Some were even stolen by intelligence agencies . An example of one such operation was when the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment managed to snatch a Libyan Mi-25 Hind helicopter gunship from Libya’s neighbor Chad in 1988. The request for information related to moving these assets states that contractors will be responsible for “all labor, equipment, and materials required to disassemble, move, permanently place, and reassemble the listed military equipment from the current Threat Training Facility (TTF) location to the newly built TTF.” Some of the materials at the site will have to be disassembled to be moved, including several radar systems and a Mi-24 Hind helicopter . According to the request, the 547th Intelligence Squadron will provide a subject matter expert to assist the contractor in disassembly, including specific information such as “which bolts are required for disassembly and subsequent reassembly.” A rendering of what the new facility will look like once completed., USAF The TTF remains relevant today in part because so many Soviet-era air-defense systems or aircraft remain in use around the world. U.S. forces responding to conflicts or crises, even in what are considered low-threat environments , could potentially face some of these older systems as non-state actors such as terrorist groups have been known to acquire and use older air defense systems . The “Petting Zoo” is just one — and probably the most public — element of a far larger enemy hardware familiarization ecosystem , much of which remains draped under a shroud of secrecy . Foreign materiel exploitation , or FME, allows U.S. forces to train on actual threat-representative systems to look for potential vulnerabilities and get acquainted with these foreign military capabilities under real-world conditions . Some of these foreign-made systems are also often used in Red Flag and other exercises to provide enhanced realism alongside simulated adversary forces. There is also a reverse engineering and deep technological exploitation aspect to some FME activities. While the full list of the assets being moved at Nellis is interesting on its own, it’s not as if these systems were a big secret once the facility was declassified. In fact, they sit out in the open and are viewable on Google Maps, and tours of the facility are provided to VIPs and those who could find it operationally beneficial. Still, seeing them listed out along with the size and weight of each piece of equipment offers a new comprehensive overview of the wide range of foreign materiel at the base. An overhead view of the facility available on Google Maps., Google Maps While the Petting Zoo at Nellis provided familiarity to a number of threats, many of which are now dated, far more modern foreign systems exist in U.S. hands and are trained against and tested in highly secure locales. It’s probable that this new facility, which appears to offer a large enclosed display space, will display a new generation of potential adversary weapons, including those from China.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 3, 2022",Video Emerges Of Centurion Cannon And Missile Repelling Drone Attack In Iraq,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Footage has surfaced online reportedly showing the moments at which two ‘suicide drones’ were shot down in Iraq. A burst of 20mm cannon fire from a Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar, or C-RAM, system brings down one of the small unmanned aircraft, while the other is destroyed by a missile of some kind, possibly a Stinger . The exact location where this video was shot has not been confirmed, but it reportedly shows drones over or at least near Ain Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, which hosts U.S. forces . Iraqi officials, as well as those from the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, announced a foiled drone attack on Ain Al Asad, which is situated around 115 miles northwest of Baghdad, earlier today. This is the second such attack in Iraq in as many days, with the one yesterday being directed at an area of Baghdad International Airport housing American troops. “Two fixed-wing drones rigged with explosives were engaged and destroyed by defensive capabilities at the Iraqi Ain al-Asad airbase early this morning,” according to a statement from the U.S.-led coalition. “The attempted attack was unsuccessful. All forces are accounted for.” No further details were provided about the “defensive capabilities” that were employed. The video now circulating on social media, seen earlier in this story, begins with a physical interceptor detonating near one of the drones, after which it begins spinning and then breaks up in a ball of flames. Though we can’t say with absolute certainty what this weapon might have been, its apparent relative size to the drone, as well as its detonation when it gets close to the unmanned aircraft, point to a short-range surface-to-air missile of some kind. One distinct possibility is that this is a heat-seeking FIM-92 Stinger . The U.S. military is known to have deployed Humvee-mounted Avenger short-range air defense systems, which are armed with Stingers, as well as a .50 caliber M3P machine gun, to Iraq or Syria, or possibly both countries, on at least some occasions in recent years amid growing drone threats . The Stinger also comes in a shoulder-fired configuration , also known as a Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). Amid increasing concerns about the dangers posed by unmanned aircraft, the U.S. Army has been fielding upgraded versions of this missile with a proximity fuze that is better optimized to engage smaller, hard-to-track targets like drones. Another possibility might be that this is a Hellfire missile. The U.S. Army recently began to field Stryker-based short-range air defense systems that have the ability to the fire millimeter-wave radar-guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfires, as well as Stingers and a 30mm cannon, at aerial threats. However, there have been no reports of these Mobile Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) systems being deployed outside of Europe so far. An Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, another asset that is at least known to have been deployed to Iraq in the past, could have fired a Hellfire at the drone, as well. This is a tactic Israel is known to employ against hostile unmanned aircraft. The War Zone has reached out to the U.S.-led coalition for more information about what effector was used and what platform launched it. A point defense surface-to-air missile system like Avenger, or some platform employing a Hellfire, would make good sense as a complement to Centurion C-RAMs, one of which is seen shooting down the other drone in the video. Centurions brought down the pair of drones attacking Baghdad International Airport yesterday, too. The Centurion is a land-based version of the Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS), which is in widespread use by the U.S. Navy and other naval forces around the world. It is armed with a Gatling-type 20mm Vulcan cannon . These guns, together with Stingers, would provide a good defensive mix against various lower-tier aerial and indirect fire threats, especially if an opponent were to launch a complex attack involving more than one type of weapon, such as drones and artillery rockets, at once. The video below shows a Centurion C-RAM system during an unrelated test shoot. No group has claimed responsibility for the drone attack on Ain Al Asad today or the one targeting the airport in Baghdad yesterday, but they bear hallmarks of previous incidents blamed on Iranian-backed militias in the country. In addition, the attack today comes just days before the second anniversary of Iran’s unprecedented ballistic missile strikes on Ain Al Asad, as well as Erbil International Airport in northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Those missile strikes had been in retaliation for the U.S. military’s killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020. The drone attacks yesterday were clearly meant to mark that anniversary, with the unmanned aircraft in that case bearing slogans specifically referencing that event and Iran’s subsequent threats to retaliate . These two back-to-back drone attacks, though foiled, only underscore the very real threat that small unmanned aircraft pose now to U.S. forces operating overseas and closer to home , as well as to domestic military and civilian targets . They also demonstrate the low barrier to entry when it comes to employing unmanned aircraft in this way, something that even non-state actors can effectively employ in large numbers. “These systems are inexpensive, easy to modify and weaponize, and easy to proliferate,” U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said last year . At that time, he further explained that he was talking about readily available commercial-grade unmanned systems that could anyone could purchase at a store like Costco for around $1,000. Iran supplies its proxies, such as those in Iraq , with much more capable armed drones , as well as the technology necessary for those actors to build their own derivatives. With all this in mind, the kind of footage that has now emerged on social media showing defenses swinging to action against the drones attacking Ain Al Asad Air Base earlier today is only likely to become a much more common sight as time goes on.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2021",Watch These Russian Su-30 Fighter Jets Fire Eight Air-To-Air Missiles Simultaneously,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The launch of an air-to-air missile from a fighter jet is normally a pretty impressive sight , especially when we have the chance to watch from the cockpit as the weapon streaks off its pylon and races toward the target. A two-ship flight of fighters each launching a missile can be more spectacular still, but the Russian Aerospace Forces have taken things up a notch with the very rare launch of eight missiles almost simultaneously from four Flanker multirole fighters. The footage was posted to the Russian Telegram messaging site today by a user named Fighterbomber, some of whose material we’ve also looked at in the past . The video, which is linked here , was taken from the cockpit of another Flanker-series jet, but we don’t know exactly where or when. It shows a formation of four Russian Aerospace Forces twin-seat Su-30SM Flanker aircraft. Each launches a pair of air-to-air missiles, which appear to be infrared-homing R-73 (AA-11 Archer) or R-74 series weapons. A weapon of the same type is seen on an underwing station in the pilot’s mirror of the camera-equipped Flanker. A single R-73 or R-74 missile is seen in one of the rear-view mirrors on the canopy rail of a Flanker fighter., TELEGRAM SCREENCAP The commentary supplied with the video offers little in the way of detail, but suggests the missiles were fired at an M6 target , a bomb-like device dropped from another aircraft before descending slowly under a parachute. It then presents an infrared or radio-frequency target that can be engaged by air-launched missiles or ground-based or naval air defenses. The photo below shows a Su-35S apparently carrying four M6 targets, which use the same casing as 220-pound SAP-series bombs. It should be noted that in the video we don’t get to see how many targets were being engaged, the distance to the target(s), or whether the various missiles all guided successfully for simulated kills. The launch of eight missiles in rapid succession is certainly dramatic, but the close proximity of the jets (one of them deploys its ‘barndoor’ air brake to help keep formation) has little in common with a genuine tactical scenario. While putting up a ‘wall’ formation to close down a huge swath of airspace is a viable tactic and was used to great effect in Operation Desert Storm , the separation between the aircraft would be much greater, both for their effectiveness and to improve their own chances of survival. The Russian live-fire drill, therefore, may well be tailored to a significant degree for public consumption. Photo opportunities like this are not unfamiliar, with several instances of four-ships of U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagles each firing a missile. Of course, these kinds of events do still provide some valuable training opportunities. A chance to fire a live missile is relatively uncommon, but it provides useful training, giving the pilot the feel of real-world air combat and beating anything the simulator might be able to offer. Adding more jets and more missiles increases the complexity and requires skillful cooperation. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30SM. This jet is armed with four R-73s and four radar-guided R-27R (AA-10 Alamo) missiles., Yevgeny Polovodov/Wikimedia Commons Training events like the one seen here are not without hazard, however; there have been some notable ‘blue-on-blue’ incidents during training. Last year it emerged that a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S Flanker fighter jet gunned down a Su-30 with its onboard cannon during a close-air-combat training mishap in the Western Military District. In another incident in 2017, but not revealed until two years later, a Russian Aerospace Forces MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor shot down its wingman using an R-33 long-range air-to-air missile over a training range close to Russia’s border with Mongolia. In the United States, at least, live-fire exercises often take place prior to a fighter squadron being deployed to an operational theater, and it could be the case that the pilots involved are headed to Syria, where the Russian Aerospace Forces maintain a significant presence and have assembled considerable combat experience. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-30SM escorts a Tu-160 Blackjack bomber during the campaign in Syria., Russian Ministry of Defense Meanwhile, of the regular air combat exercises in Russia with significant live-fire elements involving air-to-air missiles, the most prominent is probably the Ladoga series, named after the lake and region in the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4BgNmtAXXJs Live-fire exercises like this also serve to check the reliability and effectiveness of the missile and its interface with the aircraft. That may be particularly relevant depending on the type of missile used. In addition to the proven R-73, which has been in use since the early 1980s, there is also the more modern R-74M, which officially entered service in 2012. This weapon looks outwardly almost identical to the R-73 but has a new, two-band infrared seeker. This provides increased seeker range and an expanded off-boresight capability, reducing the possibility of the enemy aircraft escaping it in a tight-turning dogfight. A schematic drawing of the R-73 missile., PUBLIC DOMAIN The age of the R-73s in the Russian armory means that it makes sense to test their functionality. Meanwhile, the development of the R-74M, available in smaller numbers, has been plagued by issues with the seeker. This was originally provided by a company in Ukraine, which ended its cooperation with Russia after Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, followed by its support of separatists in Ukraine’s eastern provinces. Russia has since switched its short-range air-to-air missile efforts to the K-74M2, optimized for internal carriage by the Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter, with reports of an all-new Izdeliye 300M missile in development, too. A Su-30SM fires an AA-11 Archer missile, as seen from the cockpit, during an earlier live-fire exercise., Russian Ministry of Defense Screencap Should we find out more about the video and the background to it, we will let you know. In the meantime, however, the Russian Aerospace Forces have provided an eye-catching reminder of the important training that goes to ensure pilots and maintainers are at the top of their game, and the hardware they are responsible for functions as it should.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2022","750 F-35s Now Delivered, Navy To Put Some Of Its Oldest Test Models Into Storage","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking for a contractor to help put three early F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , two B models and C variant , which are no longer needed for flight testing purposes, into storage. This decision reflects the progress that has been finally made in moving the F-35 program out of its long-troubled testing phases . There is hope that this year the Pentagon may finally approve formal full-rate production of the jets, more than 750 of which have been delivered to customers around the world to date. The Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR) Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), which is headquartered at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, first revealed it was looking to put the F-35s in question into long-term storage in a contracting notice it posted online on Dec. 30, 2021. The three jets are presently at Patuxent River. An F-35B test jet., Lockheed Martin At least 19 F-35s of various models , including a number of non-flying ground test articles , were built specifically for testing purposes as part of the SDD phase of the program. Lockheed Martin won its first Systems Development and Design (SDD) contract in 2001 and this phase is still technically ongoing. In 2018, the program did conclude developmental flight testing , transitioning to operational testing and evaluation. “With the conclusion of the Systems Development and Design (SDD) portion of the F-35 flight test program, three of NAS Patuxent River F-35 Integrated Test Force (ITF) flight science aircraft (x1 F-35C and x2 F-35B) are no longer required to gather flight test data,” the notice explains. “Therefore, it has been determined at the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) that these aircraft will be preserved via a preservation/protection system (i.e. shrink wrap) and transported elsewhere for other uses at a later date.” Some of the key details about the Navy’s plans to put three F-35 test aircraft in storage from a recently released contracting annoucement., USN Though referred to colloquially as ‘shrink wrapping,’ the preservation process actually involves the application of a more complex set of coverings in order “to keep the jets in its [sic] original state to keep the jets from damage due to the installation/removal of the preservation system, weather, moisture, and corrosion.” This is particularly important for storing stealthy aircraft like the F-35, the radar-absorbent skins of which are made of materials that are notoriously sensitive to environmental conditions . ‘Shrink-wrapped’ F-16 fighter jets at the Air Force’s main boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona., USAF Whichever contractor NAWCAD ultimately hires to do this work, which it hopes will be done between the beginning and the end of March of this year, will need to configure the jets in such a way that they can be craned onto trucks for movement to the designated storage site. The contracting notice does not state where that site might be, but does say that it be “elsewhere” in relation to Patuxent River. A truck carries an F-35A ground test article to Wichita State University’s National Institute for Aviation Research in June 2018., KDOT NAWCAD’s contracting notice also defines “long term storage” by saying that “the jets will be stored outside in the sun and weather for up to five (5) years.” It’s not clear whether or not that means the expectation at present is that the jets will only be in storage for five years or less and there are no indications about what the Navy’s plans might be for the aircraft after that point. The contracting notice does mention the possibility of “other uses at a later date” for these planes. How useful F-35 flight science aircraft might be for future testing of any kind is unclear. The Joint Strike Fighter was developed using a process known as “concurrency,” meaning that aircraft were built with the understanding that there would be a need to integrate various fixes and modifications onto early jets as the SDD phase progressed. This was initially presented as a cost-saving concept, wherein production could be ramped up early on in the development process, but has led to cost increases and schedule delays that are likely to persist for at least some years to come still. A Joint Strike Fighter being built., Lockheed Martin In addition, this means that early jets are significantly different on many levels, even in their basic structure, from aircraft in later production lots. For instance, the differences are so significant that the Air Force is considering not upgrading entire batches of early production F-35As to the current standard configuration due to the costs involved. The F-35 JPO also canceled a third round of structural testing relating to the F-35B after determining the relevant “test article to no longer be representative of the wing-carry-through structure in production aircraft,” according to the most recent annual report on the Joint Strike Fighter from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. Beyond all this, test aircraft typically have specific systems and associated wiring, among other things, giving them distinct weights and performance specifications compared to production examples in any configuration. An F-35 ground test article undergoes structural testing., Lockheed Martin It is possible that the Navy or the F-35 JPO, or some other branch of the U.S. military or other government agency, such as NASA, might have some interest in using these early F-35s for other kinds of testing in the future, including destructive testing on the ground, or for use as training aids. The War Zone has reached out to NAWCAD for more detailed information about its current plans for the jets. No matter what, the Navy’s lack of immediate need for these three flight sciences F-35s does highlight the program’s progress toward finally bringing the SDD phase to a close after more than two decades. The F-35 JPO still needs examples of the F-35A, B, and C to at least pass various tests in an advanced simulated training environment, scheduled to take place this year , before the Pentagon will give manufacturer Lockheed Martin formal approval to begin full-rate production of these aircraft. The full-rate production decision should coincide with the end of operational testing and evaluation, which will mark the official end of the SDD phase, according to Lockheed Martin . In 2009, before the Pentagon decided to “ re-baseline ” the entire program due to cost overruns and delays, the expectation was that this milestone would come in 2013. It is worth noting that the total number of F-35s that Lockheed Martin is building every year as part of what is technically low-rate production could easily be considered full-rate production for many other types of military aircraft. The company delivered 142 Joint Strike Fighters of all variants in 2021, according to a press release it put out today. This is eight more than the 134 in 2019, which represented the previous yearly record, and 21 more than in 2020. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and friend of The War Zone noted on Twitter more than half of all F-35s ever built, more than 750 in total, have been delivered to their customers just in the last three years. Still, while the F-35 program has seen significant progress toward finally wrapping up its SDD phase, concerns are now growing about how much it will cost to operate and sustain these jets in the decades to come. A fourth major block of upgrades is already in development, but is still years away from being integrated into any of these jets and it’s not clear how much this will add to the program’s total price tag. As of 2019, the U.S. government estimated that it could cost the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy around $1.196 trillion to maintain their full expected fleets of F-35A, B, and C aircraft through 2070. It’s important to note that this is based in part on the Air Force’s stated plans to buy a total of 1,763 F-35As, a procurement plan the service is now in the process of deciding whether it wants to scale back. At the same time, the global F-35 family continues to grow. In 2021, Switzerland and Finland became the latest countries to announce plans to purchase these jets. Last year, Canada also announced that the F-35A , along with Saab’s Gripen E , were the finalists in its current fighter competition. Nine countries, including the United States, are already flying F-35 variants. The total number of variants and subvariants looks set to grow as the number of operators expands, as well, with Israel notably flying the distinct F-35I Adir version and another type is now under development for an unspecified foreign customer. As the F-35 program continues to progress, it will be interesting to see what the future will hold for older F-35s, including the three test jets the Navy now wants to put into long-term storage.

Brian O'Rourke,"Updated on Sep 6, 2019",A Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin Helicopter Can Fit Inside A C-130,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to photos of aircraft inside aircraft, no one is really surprised to see a helicopter or even a bunch of helos inside a C-17 Globemaster or a C-5 Galaxy. Those aircraft are pretty large — and built to haul outsized objects. The C-130, on the other hand, is quite a bit smaller — small enough that a C-130 fuselage, at least, can fit inside one of those same C-5s . So, the photo at the top of a Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopter inside a Coast Guard HC-130H from Air Station Clearwater, Florida, caught us a little off, uh, guard . According to a Christmas Eve post on Facebook: Air Station Miami operates five MH-65 Dolphin helicopters alongside five HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft. The Dolphins, built by Airbus and derived from that company’s AS365 Dauphin, also serve on some Coast Guard Cutters at sea. The Coast Guard considers the MH-65 a “short-range recovery” helicopter and uses it for search-and-rescue missions as well as some armed interdiction missions against smugglers and for other law enforcement activities. It has an endurance of around three hours, a top speed of 148 knots, and a range of about 300 nautical miles. These figures can vary due to the mission profile of course. Guardsmen help push a C-130 fuselage out of a C-5 Galaxy. The training fuselage was transported from the Rhode Island Air National Guard to the New York Air Guard., 109th Airlift Wing Public Affairs Air Station Clearwater operates both the Hercules and the MH-60T Jayhawk helicopter, the Coast Guard’s larger and longer-range search-and-rescue helicopter derived from the Sikorsky S-70/UH-60 Blackhawk/ Seahawk line of helicopters , of which 44 are operational. The MH-65 inventory is over double that, at 102 examples. It turns out that, while loading an MH-65 onto a C-130 is not an everyday occurrence, it’s far from unheard of. While MH-65s do self-deploy around the U.S., given the type’s range, moving one from one Coast Guard station to another inside a C-130 can be the fastest, most efficient plan, but it can also be an absolutely essential one, too. For example, the HH-65 seen below was transferred from Whidbey Island to Hawaii in 2008, when the Port Angeles, Washington station received then-upgraded MH-65s. Coast Guardsman of Coast Guard Air Station Port Angeles, Wash., load an HH-65C Dolphin helicopter into a C-130 Hercules for transport to Hawaii from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, May 20, 2008., U.S. Navy/Deputy Public Affairs Officer Tony Popp There’s also the one below from 2011 , another transfer to Hawaii, this time of an MH-65: A group of Dolphin flight mechanics pulls out an MH-65 helicopter from an HC-130 Hercules aircraft at Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii., U.S. Coast Guard The U.S. Coast Guard prides itself on its organic airlift capabilities, especially the longer-range capabilities provided by the C-130, and the new C-130J only increases what the small force of around 27 C-130s can do at any given time. Still, seeing a Hercules swallowing up a Dolphin just looks wrong, and we definitely would want someone checking our math on the weight-and-balance calculations. But the Coast Guardsmen are clearly up to this — and many other challenging tasks at sea and in the air . And we appreciate them sharing photos of it all. Contact the author: Brian@thedrive.com.

Once the President was able to deplane, he had to take a motorcade to the White House since the weather was too severe for ‘Marine One’ helicopters to fly him there. President Biden was returning from his home in Delaware, where he had spent the New Year’s weekend. Snow began to fall across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States overnight, with some parts of the D.C. metropolitan area getting as much as 10 inches by the middle of the day. This is the first major snowfall for the capital region this winter and caused numerous commercial flight cancelations and delays , as well as the closure of schools and various government buildings. Members of the press filmed ground crews working to clear snow ahead of the C-32A’s arrival, as well as the jet taxing to its parking spot. They also captured an airstair truck getting stuck in the snow and needing a push to get free, which was part of the reason for the delay in deplaning and getting Biden and others into the motorcade. In one of the videos , you can see what appears to be a military aid carrying a special large briefcase known as the “ nuclear football ” — which enables the President to order a nuclear strike and that you can read more about here — following Biden down the stairs in the snowstorm. The Air Force’s C-32As are commonly referred to as ‘Air Force Twos,’ which is the callsign used when the Vice President is on board, but they are also routinely used in the ‘Air Force One’ role in support of the President’s travels. These jets also are regularly employed as executive transports for other high-ranking U.S. government officials, such as the U.S. Secretary of State. It’s impressive on a level that a C-32A, which is based on the Boeing 757 airliner, was able to make the trip from Delaware to Andrews in this weather at all. This underscores the significant upgrades these aircraft have received over the years , including improvements in the cockpit, such as heads-up displays and enhanced vision systems, as well as enhanced communications suites, to be able to perform high-priority VIP transport missions. A C-32A on approach. Note the enhanced vision system (EVS) blister on its nose, as well as the head-up display (HUD) that projects this information, along with other critical flight data, in front of the pilot’s field of view. Both systems, especially when paired, can make landings more reliable in treacherous conditions. , Tyler Rogoway The decision to take the flight would have been the product of a risk assessment involving the Secret Service, the White House Military Office, and the Air Force’s 89th Airlift Wing, the latter of which flies the service’s C-32As, among other stakeholders, based on the transportation options available. Exactly what the weather thresholds are for such operations are not known, but we have reached out to the Air Force for more information. Regardless, it is not necessarily hard to see how flying the President back to Washington, if at all possible, would have been preferable to traveling on the ground in this weather. Driving from Delaware back to the capital would have presented its own potential hazards and might not even have been seen as a viable option, to begin with. Beyond that, the possibility of a motorcade getting stuck on a highway or some other road would have presented significant security issues and necessitated additional contingency planning to be able to extract the President from such a predicament if necessary. The fact that it was subsequently determined to be safest to take Biden from Andrews to the White House via motorcade rather than on a Marine One helicopter highlights how the weather would have impacted other contingency response options. All told, in the end, the President appears to have safely gotten back to the White House from his holiday weekend not much worse for wear, given the circumstances. Updated 6:35 PM EST: The Air Force has provided the following statement to The War Zone regarding the decision to have President Biden fly back to Washington, D.C., today: “Risk assessments are made on every mission and it was determined that the Air Force could safely support the President’s movement to DC today.” Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Force One Air Forces C-32 Transports U.S. Air Force"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have released pictures and video footage of weapons, vehicles, small boats, and other military cargo onboard the landing craft-type cargo vessel Rwabee , which the group seized in the Red Sea overnight. Saudi Arabian officials said this ship, which is flagged in the United Arab Emirates, was bringing home materiel from a disused military hospital on the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. The imagery the Houthis have released shows around a dozen of military trucks of various types, including at least one U.S.-made Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) variant and a Humvee with a large dish typically associated with ground-based satellite communications terminals. There are also a pair of rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB) and containers and crates with other items, such as AK-type rifles and magazines for those guns, body armor, and helmets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=yS6Es20Xqew What is seen appears to be at least broadly in line with the items a representative of the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting the Houthis had earlier said were onboard the Rwabee . “The cargo included ambulances, medical equipment, communication devices, tents, a field kitchen, field laundry units, and technical and security support equipment,” according to the Saudi Gazette newspaper , citing a statement from Saudi Brig. Gen. Turki Al-Malki, the coalition’s top spokesperson. “The ship was conducting a maritime mission from Socotra Island to Jazan Port [also written Jizan] when it was targeted,” according to that same report. “It carried hospital equipment that were used to operate the Saudi Field Hospital on Socotra.” The Houthis have accused the ship of entering Yemeni waters with hostile intent, leading to its seizure off the country’s coast near the port of Hodeidah. “The Yemeni armed forces are seizing an Emirati military cargo ship with military equipment on board that entered Yemeni waters without any license and engaged in hostilities targeting the security and stability of the Yemeni people,” Yahya Sare’e, a Houthi spokesperson. “The cargo ship Rwabee sailing under the flag of the United Arab Emirates was targeted through piracy and hijacking while sailing off the coast of Al-Hudaydah governorate,” Saudi Brig. Gen. Al-Malki had said . “The militia must promptly release the ship, or the Coalition Forces will undertake all necessary measures and procedures to handle this violation, including the use of force if necessary.” The Houthis have launched various kinds of attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea, as well as the Gulf of Aden, including some involving explosive-laden unmanned suicide boats , since 2015. That year, the group unseated the internationally recognized government in Yemen. That, in turn, touched off a grueling conflict with the Saudi coalition that has produced accusations of atrocities on both sides. However, actual Houthi seizures of ships have been far less common, This is the first known instance of such an operation since 2019, when the group briefly held a South Korean-flagged oil drilling rig and a Saudi Arabian-flagged tugboat. This appears to be possibly the only time the Houthis have taken control of a ship carrying military materiel belonging to the Saudi coalition, as well. In October 2016, the Houthis did severely damage a catamaran-hulled high-speed vessel that had been operated by the U.S. Navy for a time under the name Swift before being leased to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which that country said was on a humanitarian mission at the time. The Yemeni rebels claimed that the ship was in fact being used to move military personnel and materiel, an assertion that has not been substantiated. The Houthis also fired anti-ship missiles at a U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer, the USS Mason , but did not hit that ship, that same month. Whatever the exact truth behind the Houthis decision to take over the Rwabee might be, it does also follow the U.S. Navy’s seizure of approximately 1,400 AK-type rifles and some 226,600 rounds of ammunition last month. That cargo was found during a search of a stateless fishing dhow in the Arabian Sea, and American officials said the vessel was most likely carrying this materiel from Iran to Yemen. Some 1,400 AK-type rifles, as well as magazines for those guns, along with around 226,600 rounds of ammunition arrayed on the deck of the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS O’Kane after their capture in the Arabian Sea in December 2021., U.S. Navy In addition, the Saudi coalition continues to enforce significant restrictions on the ability of commercial ships and aircraft to enter Yemen, especially areas under Houthi control. The government in Riyadh has said it is maintaining this posture, which some have described as a blockade that mainly impacts innocent civilians, at the behest of the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed Yemeni government. This is among the bigger sticking points between the Saudis, who are under increasing diplomatic pressure from the U.S. government over their operations in Yemen, and Houthis in negotiations over potential peace plans. In the meantime, the Saudi coalition and its Yemeni partners continue to fight the Houthis. The Houthis have shown no sign of backing down even in the face of new offensives against them and also continue to launch drone and missile attacks against military and civilian targets in neighboring Saudi Arabia . The seizure of the Rwabee and its cargo is only likely to further frustrate progress toward any kind of settlement, or even a new ceasefire, between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 4, 2022",Suicide Drones Shot Down Over Baghdad Airport On Anniversary Of Soleimani Killing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of armed drones have been shot down today by the U.S. military during an attempted attack on Baghdad’s international airport. The unmanned aerial vehicles, described by officials as “suicide drones,” were destroyed by a Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar, or C-RAM, located within the airport perimeter. You can read more about this air-defense system, which is equipped with the famous 20mm Vulcan Gatling-style cannon, here . Officials from the Iraqi security forces and the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in the country confirmed the incident, which reportedly occurred around 4:30 am local time. Significantly, it came on the second anniversary of the U.S. assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, the division of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for militant and terrorist activities outside the country. That same drone strike, which also occurred two years ago near Baghdad Airport, additionally killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces militia operating in Iraq. Footage of the Centurion C-RAM in action during earlier trials: So far there have been no reports of any significant damage or any injuries resulting from the incident, which involved the Centurion C-RAM located at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center, although the coalition has provided imagery showing the wreckage of the fixed-wing drones used. “This was a dangerous attack on a civilian airport,” an unnamed coalition official told the Associated Press. Meanwhile, an Iraqi security official said the attack was an attempt to hit the compound at the airport used by U.S. advisors. The drones were reportedly downed as they approached the military facility. As to the origin of the attack, officials said the wreckage of the drones reveals the slogan “Soleimani’s revenge” on the wings of one, while the other carries the words “Revenge operations for our leaders.” These messages are also visible in photos of the wreckage of the drones that have been released. While no group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack, these slogans appear to point unambiguously to the work of one of the Iran-backed militias operating in Iraq. A security official inspects the wreckage of a drone at Baghdad Airport, Iraq, today., International Coalition via AP Only days after the 2020 U.S. drone strike, Iran retaliated with a ballistic missile attack launched against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. While no U.S. troops were killed in the raid, more than 100 were treated for traumatic brain injury. Ever since, there has been further talk of revenge, even going as far as an explicit threat made by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against then-U.S. President Donald Trump. While there were fears last year of a potential attack of some kind to mark the first anniversary of the death of Soleimani and al-Muhandis, this never materialized. Still, the U.S. military did beef up its presence in the Persian Gulf as a result, with overflights by B-52 bombers and the deployment of one of its four Ohio class guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, through the highly strategic and often tense Strait of Hormuz . Moreover, the Iran-backed forces and militant Shiite factions in Iraq have made repeated calls for U.S. troops to leave that country and have stipulated this is a prerequisite for ceasing their attacks. Although the formal combat mission against ISIS in Iraq has now ended , there remain around 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq in a mainly advisory capacity. As well as the attempted drone strike, Baghdad has seen hundreds of supporters of Iran-backed militia groups gather to mark the anniversary, chant anti-American slogans, and conduct a candlelight vigil. Outside of Iraq, the anniversary of the 2020 drone strike was also marked by the apparent hacking of the website of the Israeli Jerusalem Post newspaper. This replaced the main news page with an illustration recalling a ring worn by Soleimani, as well as an image of the ballistic-missile attack on the mock-up of Israel’s Dimona nuclear facility during war games last month . The paper described the hacking as an apparent threat to the country. Today has also seen the seizure of an Emirati-flagged vessel in the Red Sea by Houthi insurgents, another group who are backed and supported by Tehran in their campaign against the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. While the coalition said the vessel was carrying medical supplies, the Houthis described it as “a military cargo ship with military equipment.” We will continue to update this story as more information about today’s incident becomes available.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 14, 2023",French Rafale Naval Fighters Are Headed To India For Ski Jump Carrier Launch Tests,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This week the Rafale M fighter jet is due to begin tests at India’s naval flight test facility as it goes head-to-head with the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the competition to provide the Indian Navy with its new carrier-based combat aircraft. The Rafale, which has already been ordered by the Indian Air Force, comes to India on the back of notable export success, including a huge order for the land-based version from the United Arab Emirates. Trials of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale M are planned to start on January 6 at Indian Naval Station (INS) Hansa in the southwestern state of Goa, which includes the Shore Based Test Facility (SBTF), with a ‘ski jump’ ramp replicating that found on Indian Navy carriers . Based on the results of these evaluations and other factors, New Delhi will very likely choose from the Rafale or the Super Hornet to provide a deck-launched fighter for its new carrier, INS Vikrant , also known as Indigenous Aircraft Carrier 1 (IAC-1), which is planned to enter service in August this year, after lengthy delays. A French Navy Rafale M prepares for a catapult launch from the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle ., Dassault Aviation Reports in the Indian media indicate the Rafale M will undergo 12 days of tests at Hansa’s SBTF, apparently the first time that the jet will prove its compatibility with a ‘ski jump’ ramp, used in lieu of catapult launch gear in the short take-off but arrested recovery, or STOBAR concept of operations currently used by India. The SBTF also replicates the carrier recovery process, with arrester wires on the runway for landings. The Rafale M was developed for the French Navy as the primary aircraft armament of its sole carrier, the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle , which is configured with catapult launch gear. The Rafale M was the first variant of the fighter to enter service, initially in an air-defense-only role in 2001. The aircraft has since been successively upgraded, adding new weapons and avionics, including active electronically scanned array ( AESA ) radar, and taking part in combat operations over Afghanistan, Libya, and the Middle East. The Rafale M has also conducted joint operations from U.S. Navy carrier decks . The Rafale’s rival, the Boeing Super Hornet, in its latest Block III form , has already been involved in some high-profile ski jump operations using the ground-based ramp at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, which you can read more about in this previous article, and watch here . However, the Super Hornet is expected to arrive for further trials at INS Hansa, in March, as well. A Super Hornet launches from the ski jump during testing at Patuxent River., BOEING/TWITTER SCREENCAP The land-based version of the Rafale is already established in Indian Air Force (IAF) service, including forward-deployment to the Ladakh region , where tensions between India and China include an ongoing standoff that has spilled over into violence. It might be expected that the French jet has a certain advantage, therefore, although the local defense procurement process is notably arcane, and it’s not inconceivable that inter-service rivalry might even count against it. The sale of the Rafale to the IAF has also seen its fair share of controversy, although allegations of irregularities or corruption were ultimately rejected in the Indian courts. Meanwhile, Boeing has been campaigning heavily to sell the Super Hornet to both the IAF and the Indian Navy, and the United States has, in general, maneuvered itself to become one of the key suppliers of high-end defense technology to India, including AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and P-8I maritime patrol aircraft . However, both the Rafale and Super Hornet are likely to face more hurdles until they can be operationally fielded on INS Vikrant . As currently configured, the carrier’s elevators, installed on either end of the superstructure, are fairly small. In fact, as we have discussed before , they appear to be scaled to the Russian-made MiG-29K/KUB Fulcrum fighter jet that’s currently in Indian Navy service, aboard the carrier Vikramaditya , the Indian Navy’s flagship. With Russian consultancy provided for the IAC-1 design, the fact that the warship is optimized for operating the MiG-29K is perhaps not entirely surprising, although it suggests that a degree of modification will be required to handle the larger Rafale or Super Hornet. With the Super Hornet’s wings folded, it spans 30 feet 6 inches, leaving very little room on the elevator, which is 32 feet 10 inches wide. The Rafale, which doesn’t have a wing-fold mechanism, is wider still, at 35 feet 9 inches. With that in mind, it seems somewhat bizarre that the Indian Navy is now committed to evaluating a pair of deck fighters that can’t currently be accommodated by its forthcoming carrier, at least without some significant changes. The Hindustan Times has suggested that the Indian Navy could try and lease “four to five” Rafale Ms from France this year, which would allow crews to become familiar with operations from the land base of INS Hansa, including launch and recovery, while the INS Vikrant undergoes the required adaptations. INS Vikrant during sea trials last September., Cochin Shipyard Limited The Indian Navy is also likely looking ahead to its next indigenous carrier, INS Vishal , or IAC-2, which is planned to be significantly bigger , at around 65,000 tons, compared to 40,000 tons for the Vikrant . This new warship is expected to draw upon American and British design contributions and could feature an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) instead of the ski jump after the United States approved the transfer to India of related technology. IAC-2 will surely be scaled from the outset to handle fighters larger than the MiG-29K. What’s more, both the Rafale M and Super Hornet are already capable of operating from a catapult-assisted takeoff but arrested recovery (CATOBAR) carrier if India does take this approach for IAC-2. In the meantime, the Indian Navy continues to operate its fleet of 45 MiG-29K multirole fighters , ordered in two batches and used from the Vikramaditya as well as being shore-based at INS Hansa. However, there has been considerable effort given to finding a successor to the Russian-made Fulcrum, which has suffered from serviceability and maintenance issues, including a shortage of spare parts. Hence the evaluation of the Rafale and Super Hornet as part of the Multi-Role Carrier Borne Fighter (MRCBF) competition, which calls for 57 new jets. A Request for Information (RFI) for this was issued back in 2017, but after the design of the IAC-1 — including elevator dimensions — had been determined. A French Navy Rafale M traps aboard the USS George H. W. Bush in May 2018., Frederic Lert/Dassault Aviation There are other, smaller candidates for the new fighter, including the indigenous HAL Naval Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), a carrier-capable version of the Indian Air Force’s Tejas , but the Indian Navy has already decided against procuring this aircraft. Sweden’s Saab also pitched a carrier variant of its Gripen fighter, but this remains in project form only. The single-engined Naval LCA is currently only being used for experimental work, including at the SBTF, while India still has hopes that eventually a twin-engine development of the LCA could mature as an indigenous naval fighter, or Twin-Engine Carrier-Based Deck Fighter (TEBDF). That prospect, if feasible, remains many years away, with the most optimistic predictions suggesting service entry in the early 2030s. Procurement of Rafales or Super Hornets before then could also affect the entire future of that program. Perhaps with that in mind, Indian Navy officials have attempted to bring the TEBDF in line with an Indian Air Force requirement for new land-based fighters, although it’s hard to see a clean-sheet design winning over established, in-service designs. The first prototype Naval LCA takes off from the SBTF at INS Hansa, Goa., Indian Navy Both the Rafale and Super Hornet are in the running for the same Indian Air Force tender , which calls for 114 aircraft, although Boeing officials have in the past been lukewarm about combining the procurement of F/A-18E/Fs for both services. Boeing Defense’s Ankur Kanaglekar, who leads the company’s strategy for international sales, described the IAF and Indian Navy requirements as “very different.” All of this is happening against the backdrop of rapid Chinese developments in the field of carrier aviation. While India has now joined the select group of nations to have built an indigenous aircraft carrier, to join the Russian-made INS Vikramaditya , China has two in-service carriers, one of them home-built, plus a new indigenous design taking shape that is expected to feature EMALS rather than a ski jump ramp. China’s fourth carrier could be even bigger than its predecessors, perhaps with nuclear propulsion. In terms of aviation, India’s strategic rival is taking huge strides, with an indigenous carrier-based stealth fighter under test, plus a fixed-wing carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft , and other developments, including carrier-capable drones . For now, at least, the Indian Navy can look forward to getting an up-close look at the capabilities of two leading Western carrier fighters. While INS Vikrant continues its sea trials in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, it remains uncertain which fighters will eventually operate from it and the extent of modifications potentially required to make that happen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When talking about Red Flag , the U.S. Air Force’s premier large-scale air combat exercise series , the focus is generally on air-to-air engagements . However, simulated ground-based anti-aircraft threats are also key to replicating as realistic an experience for pilots as possible. A video on YouTube has recently come to our attention that offers a rare look at this aspect of a Red Flag exercise from the perspective of personnel playing the role of enemy air defenders trying to shoot down British C-130 Hercules transport aircraft . It is not clear when the video, which was posted in September of this year, was actually shot. Red Flag exercises have been conducted regularly since 1975 and take place over the sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) adjacent to Nellis Air Force Base outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. YouTube user Tim Gosling who put it on online describes it as “Highlights from a fun time out round Las Vegas 30 plus years ago, dodging pretend SAMs and not going into Area 51.” This would date the video to the early 1990s. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YSvaOr8elio “Live ammunition is used for air-to-ground sorties, there is a ‘Red Air’ contingent to simulate enemy fighters and representative hostile surface-to-air missile radar systems,” the description adds. “RED FLAG has long been an international event and has been highly useful to the RAF, including this case the C-130s from RAF Lyneham flying simulated behind-the-lines air drop missions. And of course there were also the attractions of Las Vegas.” The video is a montage of clips taken from two different perspectives, the view from an optical tracking system and from what appears to be the inside of a radar control van. This kind of footage could be helpful for debriefing aircraft crews after an exercise, as well as a general instructional aid. An example of the footage from the optical tracking system that is seen in the video., YouTube capture An example of one of the clips in the video that appears to have been shot inside a radar van., YouTube capture It’s unclear what threat system or systems we are seeing replicated here. However, the radar van clips show side-by-side vertical displays that are similar to those associated with engagement and fire control radars used in a wide variety of Soviet-era surface-to-air missile systems dating all the way back to the S-75 Dvina , also known as the SA-2 Guideline, its NATO reporting name. The video below is from a highly detailed computer simulation of the user interface for an SA-2E surface-to-air missile system showing typical side-by-side radar displays found on various Soviet-era systems. The optical tracking system feed has a range scope indicator overlaid on top of it, along with other data, which is also similar to fire control components found on Soviet-era surface-to-air missile systems. The range scope indicator is a wave that peaks as a target approaches and the associated radar locks on or attempts to lock on. It is very possible that what we are seeing here are systems that are not just designed to replicate those kinds of Soviet-era threats, but are actually the real deal. The U.S. military has captured and otherwise acquired various pieces of foreign materiel over the years, including surface-to-air missile systems and associated radars . Though these assets are too low-density to be used on a wide-scale basis, they are still often employed in training exercises to provide enhanced realism alongside full-scale surrogates and other simulated threats . All of these simulated hostile elements on the ground are integrated into the larger opposing force plan, which includes “Red Air” aggressor aircraft , as well. It is very possible that the optical tracking system seen in this video could be one associated with a Soviet 9K33 Osa mobile surface-to-air missile system, which the U.S. Air Force has at least one example of available for use as a training aid. The Osa, also known by the NATO reporting name SA-8 Gecko, is a low-altitude, short-range air defense system that uses command-guided missiles and is known to have an optical tracking system as a backup to its onboard radars. This would all fit very much with the low-level engagement scenario seen in the footage. An SA-8 surface-to-air missile system on a trailer ahead of a US Air Force training exercise in 2017., USAF Inside the SA-8., USAF The SA-8’s user interface , as depicted in the computer simulation seen in the video below, includes a range scope indicator, but does not feature the side-by-side displays seen in parts of the video, but that footage could easily be from within a separate radar van. The Air Force has a number of stand-alone Soviet-era radar systems that are available for use during Red Flag. Regardless of the specific system in use, the footage shows various attempts to lock onto and engage C-130s flying at very low altitude, offering a good look at a number of tactics, techniques, and procedures that pilots can use to evade enemy surface-to-air missiles. There is some pretty impressive maneuvering to be seen from the Hercules crews. Sound bytes from the personnel acting as the faux hostile air defense forces underscore the challenges they can face, as well. “And I just lost him on ground clutter,” one individual says at one point in the video, highlighting the difficulty many radars have in separating aircraft from the terrain at low levels. “We locked on ground clutter again.” “Yeah, I just locked up and I’m going to launch right now,” that same person continues. “I just lost him. … I think he gave me chaff there.” Chaff refers to various materials that an aircraft can release to blind or confuse enemy radars. When the concept was first invented during World War II, strips of aluminum were used for this purpose. More modern chaff consists of bundles of metal-coated glass or plastic fibers. US Navy RR-144, at top, and RR-129 chaff countermeasures, as well as loose chaff, at right. These are examples of more modern metal-coated fiber-type chaff., USN “He’s chaffing. And just went below terrain and chaffed me. Broke me with chaff and then went terrain masking,” another person is heard saying in the video, showing how chaff could be used together with the benefits of ground clutter, as well as just hiding behind terrain features like mountains, to evade enemy air defenses. “That’s going to be a miss due to chaff.” That same individual mentions at one point that they’re launching a “Smokey Sam.” Developed by the Navy in the 1980s, the Smokey Sam , also known as the GTR-18A, is a cheap paper and styrofoam rocket that is simply designed to create a visual signature similar to a real surface-to-air missile launch to provide added realism during training. This gives pilots something to actually look for when practicing scanning for and spotting incoming attacks. This unguided rocket’s construction means that it is extremely unlikely to be dangerous in any way to aircraft flying overhead, even if it actually impacts one. Now, of course, enemy air defense capabilities, as well as friendly countermeasures systems, have continued to evolve and improve in the decades since these video clips were shot. At the same time, a not-insignificant amount of what is seen, on both the part of the air defenders and the pilots attempting to evade them, remains relevant today. Large numbers of older Soviet-era surface-to-air missile systems, as well as improved variants and derivatives , remain in service around the world and are threats that would need to be taken into consideration during U.S. military responses to many potential crises, even in lower-threat environments . In addition, Short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems, including both man-portable and vehicle-based types , are experiencing something of a renaissance globally and more modern types are proliferating ever-more widely a result, including to non-state actors . Chaff and terrain masking remain important tools for friendly pilots, especially those behind the controls of slower, non-stealthy platforms, such as C-130s. Air Force special operations units operating MC-130 variants and other specialized aircraft , in particular, train to conduct very low-level flights at night in order to help avoid detection and potential threats when inserting or extracting forces from denied or otherwise sensitive areas. All told, this video is a very interesting behind-the-scenes look at an often underappreciated aspect of Air Force Red Flag exercises as seen from the equally unusual perspective of individuals filling the role of enemy surface-to-air missile system operators.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 11, 2021",Infrared Search And Track Pods Spotted On USAF F-15 Eagles Based In Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighters based at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa , Japan, have been spotted carrying the Lockheed Martin Legion Pod , apparently for the first time. This system has an infrared search and track sensor, or IRST, which provides the pilot with a valuable new way of detecting and tracking other aircraft at long ranges, including ones that employ stealth technology to hide from radar. While the Legion Pod has been seen on test Eagles for some time now, this seems to be the first evidence that frontline F-15C/Ds overseas are now flying with the sensor. A series of photos taken today and posted to Twitter by aviation photographer @SuneKuma01 includes two views of the same F-15C, serial number 81-0050, assigned to Kadena’s 67th Fighter Squadron , with a Legion Pod under the fuselage. The 67th FS is one of two F-15C/D squadrons at Kadena, both part of the 18th Wing. The only other overseas U.S. Air Force F-15C/D unit is based in England . Close-up of a Legion Pod installed on an F-15., Lockheed Martin The Air Force had previously said the pod was likely to attain initial operational capability in 2020, so it shouldn’t be a huge surprise that the store has now appeared on a frontline Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) F-15 at Kadena. Furthermore, the Japanese facility’s strategic location in regard to China, North Korea, and Russia means it was likely to be among the first in line to get the Legion Pod. F-15Cs assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron prepare to take off during a training sortie at Kadena Air Base, Japan. The 44th FS and 67th FS are the only U.S. Air Force F-15 units in the Asian-Western Pacific area of operations., U.S. Air Force/Naoto Anazawa Despite their age, the Air Force’s fleet of roughly 220 F-15C/Ds are still formidable air-superiority jets, with a combat record unrivaled among other in-service fighters. Although a replacement is starting to arrive in the shape of the F-15EX , the original F-15C/Ds have been upgraded repeatedly to keep them combat-relevant. As well as AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radars and new cockpit displays , the jets have received the Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP), an example of which can be seen on another jet that @SuneKuma01 photographed today. While the Sniper pod is traditionally used for air-to-ground precision strike and reconnaissance functions, the F-15C/D community adapted it for long-range visual identification purposes. In that role, it can ID aircraft day or night dozens of miles away and can be automatically slewed to radar target to do so. Still, it is not an IRST and has very limited capability in replicating an IRST’s core functionality, especially the latest generation of these systems that are incredibly capable. As for the Legion Pod with its IRST payload, you can read more about the capabilities that it offers here . Suffice it to say that it’s a tool that allows the pilot to rapidly spot and then track multiple targets well beyond visual range. The pod can also provide targeting information so the pilot can engage an enemy passively, without emitting any electromagnetic energy which can allow the hunted to detect the hunter, as is the case when using radar in many cases. The targeting data can also be combined with information from other sensors, and especially other aircraft carrying IRSTs, for a more accurate ‘fix.’ LOCKHEED MARTIN It’s easy to see how these kinds of advantages could come into play in the Asia Pacific theater, especially during a confrontation with China. In such circumstances, there would likely be intense electronic jamming, potentially degrading the Eagle’s AN/APG-63 radar. There would also be a host of potential threat sensors likely looking out for an F-15’s radar emissions. Airborne early warning and control aircraft that support F-15 operations so heavily would also be top targets . Add enemy stealth fighters into the mix, and the need for additional means to acquire and engage enemy aerial threats passively becomes even more important. We must stress that a modern IRST’s ability to find targets that leverage radio-frequency low-observability (radar stealth) as a primary design driver, such as stealthy fighters , drones , bombers , and especially cruise missiles, would put this system in extremely high demand for Kadena’s Eagles. The island airbase itself would be a target of many of these capabilities during a conflict with China. The threat posed by low-flying stealthy cruise missiles alone has the USAF spooked, and its Eagles are now training against low observable targets in anticipation of confronting such a threat during a time of war. China’s J-20 fighter is a prominent low-observable threat in the PACAF area of operations., CHINESE INTERNET Lockheed Martin leveraged technology for the IRST21 sensor from the earlier AN/AAS-42 IRST system that was found in the F-14D Tomcat . Before the Legion Pod, the company also furnished the Tiger Eyes sensor system for certain advanced export derivatives of the F-15E Strike Eagle. The background to the current pod is something you can read more about here . After being tested aboard an F-16 , the Legion Pod began flying on an F-15C in 2016 and a year later was selected by the Air Force in favor of the rival OpenPod from Northrop Grumman. The Legion pod has since begun testing on other platforms, too, including General Atomics’ stealthy Avenger drone . An F-15C fitted with a Legion Pod during the Northern Edge 21 exercise earlier this year., U.S. AIR FORCE At the same time, the IRST21 is being adopted by the U.S. Navy, with Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornet receiving the same sensor in a modified centerline drop tank. An earlier version of the Navy’s own similar IRST system has already been deployed aboard carriers and flown on missions over the Middle East. The IRST21 is also incorporated in the Air Force’s Talon HATE communications node pod and will likely be a major sensor for various drone programs that are been spun up now . The Legion Pod is an open-architecture design with extra space to include additional capabilities, which means that other sensors and payloads can be added in the future. With this in mind, Kadena Eagles could eventually use the same pods to carry other capabilities, like electronic warfare or communications equipment, while also retaining the IRST in some cases. Work has already begun to add a data link to the pod , allowing two IRST-equipped F-15Cs to determine the range of a given target “near instantaneously” via triangulation. A Lockheed Martin diagram showing data-linked Legion Pods., Lockheed Martin The potential for the Legion Pod to share data between jets for more accurate firing solutions and enhanced situational awareness speaks to another advantage of the store. Ultimately, it will serve to boost connectivity between F-15s and also help share information from multiple sources as a significant battlefield force multiplier. All in all, the Kadena Eagle community getting their hands on the long-awaited IRST-equipped Legion Pods is significant. The base’s location also provides an ideal environment to test the pod over land and sea, and it seems certain that we will be seeing a lot more of these new stores in the future, both on Kadena Eagles at home in Okinawa, and Eagles deployed to different theaters around the world, as well as right here in the United States for homeland air sovereignty missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",China Releases Image Of Japanese Carrier Sailing Right Alongside Its Own Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Chinese government has released video footage and pictures, seen at the top of this story and below, showing Japan’s aircraft carrier Izumo sailing remarkably close to the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s own flattop Liaoning and its escorts during recent exercises in the Pacific. This comes after Japanese officials announced plans to set up a military hotline with their counterparts in China to help de-escalate potential alterations in the future. The office of the Joint Staff of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) first announced that it had observed Liaoning , along with a Type 052D destroyer , a Type 054A frigate , and a Type 901 replenishment ship, transiting from the East China Sea into the western Pacific Ocean southeast of Okinawa on Dec. 15. The Chinese flotilla then moved farther southeast and conducted a series of drills, including the launch and recovery of J-15 fighter jets from the Liaoning , as well as flights by Z-9 and Z-18 helicopters. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels subsequently returned to the East China Sea on Dec. 25. Pictures the Japanese government released of the Chinese ships after they transited from the East China Sea into the Pacific. From top to bottom: the aircraft carrier Liaoning , the Type 054A frigate, the Type 052D destroyer, and the Type 901 replenishment ship., Japanese MoD A map Japanese officials released with a red dot showing the general area where Chinese naval forces conducted their exercises earlier in December., Japanese MoD Japanese authorities had previously said that Izumo , together with the destroyer Akizuki , had monitored the Chinese activities. JSDF P-1 and P-3 maritime patrol planes had also helped keep an eye on the PLAN exercises, and Japanese fighter jets were scrambled at times in response to Chinese J-15s flying from Liaoning . Footage showing a Japanese F-15J Eagle fighter jet intercepting a Chinese J-15, shot from the latter aircraft’s cockpit during these recent drills, has been released, as well. In general, one country’s naval vessels shadowing those of another in international waters, especially when foreign warships come relatively close to a nation’s territorial waters, happens on a regular basis around the world. At present, there is no indication one way or another that either Chinese or Japanese forces acted in dangerous or otherwise unprofessional ways during their encounters earlier this month. At the same time, it is highly unusual to employ an aircraft carrier in this role and to have it operate so close to the other navy’s ships. Japan, like other countries, more typically employs smaller vessels for shadowing missions. The JSDF seems to have clearly intended, at least in part, to send a signal to its Chinese counterparts about its capabilities and willingness to employ them with these relatively intimate interactions in the western Pacific. While it is not clear how close the Japanese carrier ever came to any of the PLAN vessels, the distances do appear to be relatively short for such large warships. This degree of proximity would help explain how Japanese forces were able to take the close-up shots of these Chinese counterparts operating in the Pacific that had been included in previous JSDF Joint Staff press releases. A picture Japanese officials previously released showing a J-15 fighter jet taking off from Liaoning while a Z-9 helicopter acts as a plane guard. Based on the sharpness of its focus and its perspective, along with what we know now of the proximity between the two ships, this picture may well have been shot from the deck of Izumo ., Japanese MoD Other pictures the Japanese government previously released of Liaoning and elements of its air wing during recent exercises in the Pacific., Japanese MoD Japanese MoD Japanese MoD The presence of the Chinese ships in the Pacific south of Japan reflects the PLAN’s ever-increasing operational tempo , as well as its increasing ability to project significant naval power beyond China’s immediate periphery . In October, another group of PLAN warships joined naval vessels from Russia on a joint patrol that almost saw them circumnavigate Japan’s Home Islands, a significant demonstration of China’s current maritime capabilities. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force has itself increased the scale and scope of its activities in recent years , including taking part in a growing number of multi-national naval and other kinds of drills in the Pacific. Just this year, Izumo hosted U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs in an exercise that saw fighters fly from a Japanese carrier for the first time since World War II. All of this also comes amid a period of very high friction between Chinese and Japanese authorities. In particular, the government in Japan under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has decided to take a much more outspoken position in support of the government on Taiwan. Japanese officials have indicated that they would support a U.S.-led military response to any Chinese intervention on that island and have been critical of Beijing’s coercive behavior toward authorities in Taipei. This is a major shift in Japanese policy that has drawn the ire of officials in Beijing, who view Taiwan as a rogue province. Kishida has also been openly critical of China’s crackdowns on pro-democracy advocates and others in Hong Kong and on ethnic Uighurs in its western Xinjiang province. Japan and China continue to have a long-standing and fierce dispute over control of a chain of uninhabited islands that lie between Taiwan and Okinawa, as well. For its part, the regime in Beijing has been increasingly critical of Japan’s efforts to expand and modernize its military capabilities in recent years, as well as efforts to reform or even eliminate Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution that bans the country from using its forces for any purpose beyond self-defense. Izumo , which Japanese authorities asserted for years was a helicopter carrier incapable of carrying out anything that could be described as an offensive military mission, is one significant element of this debate. In 2018, officials in Japan admitted that Izumo and her sister ship Kaga had been designed from the outset to be readily convertible to support fixed-wing aircraft. Izumo is now expected to be fully converted into a true light aircraft carrier capable of accommodating an air wing that includes Japanese F-35B Joint Strike Fighters by 2024. Japan’s two Izumo class aircraft carriers in port., Kyodo via AP Amid these growing tensions, Japan’s Ministry of Defense announced on Dec. 28 that it had agreed to establish a hotline with Chinese military officials specifically to provide a channel to defuse potential crises. The Chinese government did not directly confirm these plans, which emerged from a phone call between Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe on Monday. The Chinese Defense Ministry did issue a statement attributed to Wei that said the two men had talked about ways to “prevent the escalation of conflicts and continuously improve the level of defense co-operation,” along with other issues. While it remains to be seen when this hotline might be formally established and how it might actually be utilized, the interactions between Izumo and Liaoning , as well as the latter’s escorts, earlier this month highlight exactly the kind of situation where such a communications channel might come into play. Beyond that, Japan’s very close monitoring of these Chinese drills in the Pacific simply underscores the growing potential for more serious altercations between the two countries’ navies.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 15, 2020",Japan Wants To Arm Its Submarines With Long-Range Cruise Missiles: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent reports indicate that Japan is considering introducing a new long-range cruise missile capability to its existing submarine fleet , or future submarines, with a weapon that would have a range of over 620 miles and would be fielded from the latter half of the 2020s. The indigenous missile would provide the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF, with a new standoff capability to attack both enemy surface warships and land targets and is clearly seen as a potential counter to offset growing threats from China and North Korea . A report in Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper cites several unnamed government officials who confirm that Tokyo is looking at the possibility of equipping current and/or future JMSDF submarines with long-range cruise missiles. These would be derived from the Type 12 subsonic anti-ship missile that’s already in service with the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, or JGSDF, and which has a range of around 124 miles in its current form. At this stage, both vertical launch system (VLS) and torpedo-tube-launched options are being examined for the new missile. As it stands, the JMSDF does not have any submarine-based VLS in service. There is also currently no confirmation of the size of magazine capacity being considered for the missile-armed submarines. Test-firing of a Japan Ground Self-Defense Forces Type 12 anti-ship missile., JGSDF The Yomiuri Shimbun report stresses the potential for JMSDF submarines armed with the new cruise missiles to attack ground targets, in particular “enemy missile launch bases for the purpose of self-defense.” However, an accompanying graphic shows a submerged submarine using the same weapon to target a hostile surface combatant, as well. Indeed, the article suggests that the anti-ship version of the missile would actually be introduced first, “to counterattack enemy ships from outside the missile range of the opponent,” before the same weapon is further adapted for “attacking enemy bases in the future.” Ultimately, it would seem likely that a single missile would be furnished for both anti-ship and land-attack roles, as is the case with the Tomahawk Block IV , or the Norwegian-designed Joint Stike Missile (JSM), which Japan has procured for its F-35 stealth jets . The emphasis on “self-defense” reflects the need for the Japanese military to at least frame capabilities such as these within the context of the country’s constitution , which rules out offensive action. However, the reality around this provision is fast degrading, with significant recent developments including acceptance of fixed-wing-capable aircraft carriers . A precise timeline for the development of the new long-range cruise missile has not been revealed, although planned service entry toward the end of this decade seems ambitious, especially considering the VLS containers would have to be retrofitted to existing boats, space permitting, or otherwise installed in still-to-be-launched submarines. It is worth noting that South Korea is currently understood to be working on building Dosan Ahn Changho class submarines with progressively increased VLS cells, starting with six and working up to 10, which will accommodate cruise missiles or ballistic missiles . This kind of step-by-step approach might be an option for Japan, too, as would opting for torpedo tube-launched missiles on older boats and VLS in new-construction hulls. The JMSDF’s submarines are already equipped with Harpoon anti-ship missiles that are launched from standard torpedo tubes, but they have a much shorter range than is anticipated for the new weapon and no land-attack capability. The latest UGM-84L Harpoon Block II in JMSDF service can reach targets out to around 80 miles. The report states that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aims to include the “capacity to attack enemy bases” in the country’s next National Security Strategy , which is due to be published late next year, and which will set out Tokyo’s medium to long-term guidelines for defense and foreign policies. Submarine-launched missiles would be one way of achieving that goal. With the JMSDF operating a fleet of 22 conventionally powered submarines, and with at least two more to be added in the future, there are potentially plenty of hulls that could be adapted. However, an air-launched or ship-based land-attack cruise missile would also seem to fit this requirement. On the other hand, work is already underway to extend the range of the truck-launched Type 12 anti-ship missile as well as to adapt it for potential air launch by Japan Air Self-Defense Force, or JASDF, F-15J fighter jets, as part of an upgrade for these aircraft . An artist’s impression of an upgraded Japanese F-15J carrying an AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) on its centerline. This is one option for a long-range missile that could be added as part of the F-15J upgrade., BOEING Initial work on an extended-range Type 12 began back in the 2018 fiscal year , but, in December last year, it was reported that Tokyo had decided to embark on a related redesign of the missile, adding larger flying surfaces and a powerplant optimized for high-altitude flight, as well as additional fuel. That would increase the range from the current 124 miles to 560 miles, and, later, up to 930 miles. Even with the initial range extension, the new weapon would be in broadly the same category that’s required for the new cruise missile. Importantly, the revised Type 12 would also be capable of hitting ground targets and is also planned to incorporate radar cross-section reduction measures, making it harder to detect. At the time, there was no mention that this extended-range Type 12 was envisaged for submarine launch as well. However, work on these revisions to the Type 12 was expected to be carried out between fiscal years 2019 and 2023, which would also fit with the timescale required for the submarine-launched cruise missile. The Type 12 ground-launched anti-ship missile: A dual-role long-range cruise missile would be of considerable value to the JMSDF as it contends with a rapidly growing fleet of Chinese surface warships. Activity by People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) warships in the waters around Japan and in the South China Sea and the East China Sea — the latter home to a long-running dispute over ownership of an uninhabited island chain — has increased in recent years and now includes aircraft carrier battle groups. At the same time, the land-attack configuration of the new weapon would allow Japan to strike against critical ground targets, such as the proliferating ballistic missile capabilities in both China and North Korea. The latter country has, on multiple occasions, launched ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan into waters off that country. Other critical military and leadership infrastructure, as well as airbases and air-defense sites, would be likely targets for the JSMDF’s long-range cruise missiles in times of conflict. Should either China or North Korea attempt to attack Japan, a submarine-based land-attack cruise missile capability provides a much more survivable means of delivering a counterstrike, even if considerable numbers of aircraft and surface vessels have already been hit in the enemy’s first strike. The effectiveness would be enhanced by not only the relatively large size of the JMSDF’s submarine fleet, but also the fact that it operates some of the most advanced conventionally powered boats in service anywhere in the world, and among the quietest, including a propulsion arrangement based around lithium-ion batteries in the newest boats. Japan’s most advanced submarine, the Taigei is launched in October 2020 in the city of Kobe. , Japanese Ministry of Defense However, with the modifications to the Type 12 in mind, it seems work on producing a long-range cruise missile may already be fairly well advanced. There are also unconfirmed reports that the lead boat in the Taigei class may be planned for use as a trials submarine, to assess the viability of VLS or tube-launched cruise missiles. Reportedly, a hull section matching the dimensions of the Taigei class has been noted at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries dockyard in Kobe with an enlarged upper part that may relate to tests of a VLS installation. Japan has also looked in the past at an off-the-shelf purchase of Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States, which we reported on back in 2017. The plan was to use these missiles as standoff retaliatory strike weapons against North Korean missile launchers and launch facilities. While this parallels at least part of the mission expected of the long-range cruise missile, Japan’s Tomahawk plans envisaged acquiring a surface-warship-launched version of the missile, rather than a sub-launched one. Although there has been no serious move since then to buy Tomahawks, the Block IV version of the missile appears to meet Japanese requirements perfectly. As well as adding an all-new land-attack mission to the submarine fleet, introducing a weapon of this type with the ability to strike well beyond Japan’s territorial boundaries would again signal the continued shift away from the traditional purely ‘defensive’ nature of its military. The same missile could also very likely be easily adapted for launch from VLS cells onboard JMSDF surface warships, too. Whatever form the future long-range cruise missile takes, it’s now clear that the country’s strategic posture is increasingly calling for these kinds of long-range strike capabilities as part of the submarine force and the wider armed forces.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma is something of a Mecca for many of the Air Force’s large aircraft. Beyond being home plate for the service’s E-3 Sentry airborne warning and control (AWACS) community, as well as a major KC-135 tanker base, among other functions, it serves as the depot maintenance and upgrade center for the B-1, B-52, E-3, E-6, and KC-135. More recently, it picked up the same role for the Air Force’s fledgling KC-46 fleet . Due to that depot maintenance mission — where the aircraft essentially get disassembled and refurbished — these aircraft take to the skies over the base from time-to-time looking unlike they would anywhere else — totally naked. One photographer, who goes by the handle Redhome Aviation , has captured Tinker’s ‘naked planes’ in spectacular fashion and has posted some of the shots on his Instagram page . After seeing some of these awesome shots on Instagram, I reached out to him for a bit of background and to see if we could do a full layout. He was up to the task in both regards. Here is some commentary about the images and a bit more about how Tinker Air Force Base is an aviation photographer’s dream spot from Redhome Aviation: As a photojournalist, the area is ideal for aviation photography. After depot maintenance is accomplished on the aircraft, they are flown by the 10th Flight Test Squadron of the Air Force Reserve Command. After maintenance, the aircraft are typically sent for paint before their test flight, but on the occasions where their scheduled date in the paint barn is after the aircraft has cleared post dock, we get the rare ‘naked’ flight. The rarest aircraft to photograph in the nude is the B-1B Lancer, while the most famous aircraft in the buff was B-52H Stratofortress 60-0034 “Wise Guy” after restoration from the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ in December 2020. We have even been afforded the views of a disassembled B-1B 86-0101 “Watchman” on her way via road to Wichita State University for digital imaging of her entire frame. We have a special location in the heart of Oklahoma where we get to see the hard work of the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group, the 76th Propulsion Maintenance Group, and the expert aviating of the world’s best aviators. There is no better spot in the world to see the E-3s of America’s Wing, the E-6B Mercury of STRATCOM Wing 1, KC-135s of the SH Okies gracing the skies, or the aviators in training from Vance AFB, Altus AFB, and Sheppard AFB as they practice navigation and approaches on one of the best airfields in the country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2021","No, Russia’s S-550 Missile Defense System Hasn’t Been Fielded","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two Russian state media outlets, both citing unnamed sources, have offered wildly different claims about the status of the development of the country’s S-550 missile defense system, which could also have anti-satellite capabilities . RIA Novosti reported today that, while there is active work being done on the S-550, no full-scale prototypes have been built so far and there are no live-fire tests scheduled yet. That comes a day after a story from TASS that declared that the system had entered operational service . Substantive details about the S-550 remain very limited. Russian Defense Ministry Sergei Shoigu first revealed publicly that the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, had personally ordered the development of the system in November. There had been a Soviet-era missile defense program that used this same nomenclature and never came to fruition, and this new project may leverage some part of that work. Previous reports have indicated that the new S-550 could be intended to engage a variety of targets at extremely high altitudes, including intercontinental ballistic missiles in the mid-course portions of their flights , as well as hypersonic weapons and even satellites . Shoigu’s disclosure of the existence of the rebooted S-550 effort notably came just days before the Russian military conducted a widely criticized anti-satellite weapon test involving the destruction of a defunct Soviet intelligence satellite, which created a dangerous debris cloud in space. There is the possibility that TASS ‘ source may have confused the S-550 with the S-500 , another air-defense system Russia is developing that is being designed with a primary focus on missile defense. The operational state of the S-500, which has been in development since at least 2009, is not entirely clear. “The state trials have just completed, and the first supplies of this complex have started,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said about the S-500 in September. However, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko said earlier this month that “next year, it is planned to complete trials and introduce into service the S-500 missile system and the Voronezh radar that works in the meter range of wavelengths.” It is unclear if Krivoruchko was only referring to state trails dealing with the combination of the S-500 and Voronezh radar or if he was contradicting Borisov’s earlier remarks. He had previously said that deliveries of this system would not begin until 2025. The S-500 has certainly been undergoing full-scale testing in recent years. RIA Novosti ‘s story today was mainly focused on a reported test of this system on a range in the Arctic that resulted in the shooting down of an unspecified “hypersonic target.” It is worth noting, if this report is accurate, that this doesn’t mean the S-500 has demonstrated an ability to engage something like a highly maneuverable hypersonic boost-glide vehicle traveling along an atmospheric flight path. Many ballistic missiles, as well as the separate re-entry vehicles that certain types are designed to release , reach hypersonic speeds, defined as anything above Mach 5, in the terminal phase of their flight. The video below shows an earlier S-500 test. It is possible that the initial TASS report was, at best, incorrect in part or in whole — or entirely made up by the source in question. Russian state media outlets have a long history of trumpeting extremely implausible claims about the country’s development of advanced weapons and other details about its defense industry. If anything is clear from these competing reports about the state of the S-550 program, as well as this recent test of the S-500, it’s that there seems to be a surge in interest in missile defense and a renewed commitment to developing anti-satellite capabilities within the Kremlin. The destructive anti-satellite test in November was certainly one firm indicator of this. In recent weeks, Putin and other Russian officials have issued a string of strongly-worded statements in regard to the potential future deployment in Europe of new longer-range cruise and ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic weapons, particularly by the United States. “The United States is standing with missiles on our doorstep.” Putin said during a fiery televised press conference last week. “How would the Americans react if missiles were placed at the border with Canada or Mexico?” Russian President Vladimir Putin during his televised press conference on Dec. 23, 2021., AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko “If NATO sticks with the position not to negotiate about a deal, then we will certainly see Russia deploy the Screwdriver missile at its very western border,” Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had said separately on Dec. 13. “That is, it will be a confrontation, this will be the next round.” Screwdriver is NATO’s official reporting name for a ground-launched cruise missile that is also referred to in the West as the SSC-8 and, in Russia, as the 9M729. The U.S. government said this weapon violated the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, INF, and cited it as the reason for its unilateral withdrawal from that bilateral agreement with Moscow in 2019. Russia has since offered a new moratorium on the deployment of various missiles that had been banned under the INF, among other proposals . At the same time, the U.S. Army, in particular, is looking to field a number of new hypersonic and other longer-range ground-based missiles before 2030 and is already laying the groundwork to be able to deploy them to Europe, among other locations, as required. In November, the service reactivated the 56th Artillery Command in Germany, saying it had the task, among various missions, of supporting the deployment of “future long-range surface to surface” missiles. U.S. Army soldiers and contractors load an empty missile canister onto a prototype launcher for its future Dark Eagle hypersonic missile., U.S. Army Putin and other officials within the Russian government have also attempted to link all of this to the current crisis around Ukraine. Russia’s deployment of tens of thousands of troops and other assets to areas near the Ukrainian border continues to raise concerns that the Kremlin may be actively planning to launch a new large-scale military intervention against its neighbor early in the coming year. Russian authorities have mentioned securing some kind of prohibition on the deployment of new missiles capable of targeting Moscow in Western Europe as one of a number of “red line” issues that they want to see resolved as part of any deal to de-escalate the situation. NATO’s own missile-defense capabilities, particularly the U.S.-operated Aegis Ashore site in Romania and the forthcoming one in Poland , have been and continue to be areas of major criticism for the Kremlin, as well. It seems highly unlikely the United States and NATO would be able to meet Russia’s other red line demands on these issues, or any others, even if they wanted to. The proposals that Putin has laid out so far include things like NATO scaling back its force posture in Europe to how things were in May 1997. Since then, 14 more countries have joined the alliance. Beyond that, a number of those nations had previously been part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and some of them, especially the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, pushed for entry into NATO in no small part to reinforce their independence after the collapse of the USSR. The alliance at present seems to be firmly against offering any real concessions in response to the Kremlin’s stated security concerns, real or imagined. With all of this in mind, there have been accusations that Russia’s red lines are nothing more than pretexts for military action against Ukraine. All told, there doesn’t seem to be anything to these claims that Russia has made dramatic progress on developing and fielding the S-550, so much so that one of the country’s state media outlets has now issued a contradictory report. At the same time, the Kremlin is clearly interested in bolstering its missile defense capabilities as the United States gets closer to being able to deploy new longer-range missiles to Europe.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs shows the aftermath of yesterday’s Israeli airstrike on the Syrian port of Latakia, which reportedly targeted a shipment of “arms and munitions.” The air raid, apparently launched by Israeli Air Force aircraft over the Mediterranean, resulted in a huge blaze at the port facility, which took firefighters many hours to bring under control.

As of today, palls of smoke were still visible overhead the port, although the overall damage appeared to be generally restricted to the container terminal itself, with no apparent harm done to the area immediately surrounding the port. Surprisingly little is visible in terms of cratering, too. The attack looks like it was astonishingly precise, striking individual or small groups of containers only. Satellite image with red circles showing impact areas., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports that have emerged since yesterday’s attack claim that two members of the Syrian military were killed in the raid. As for the origin of the reported arms shipment that the Israeli Air Force targeted, there has been no confirmation that this was provided by Iran. In the past, however, Tehran has delivered to Syria weapons ultimately intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah group as well as other Iranian-backed forces in Syria and Lebanon. “If the strikes in Latakia were, indeed, carried out by Israel, they were presumably designed mostly to prevent the buildup of [the] Iranian’s capabilities in Syria,” said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy Israeli national security adviser, quoted in a report from the Wall Street Journal . “But there is a secondary benefit of reminding the Iranians that Israel can strike at any time,” he added. Now, however, an unconfirmed report suggests that the attack on the port may be connected to the arrival of the Iranian-flagged container vessel Shiba , owned by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, which was noted transiting the Bosphorus en route from Latakia to Chornomorsk in Ukraine today. Allegedly, the vessel unloaded a consignment of containers at Latakia, although this has so far not been independently verified. According to publicly available ship-tracking data, the Shiba had departed Latakia on December 25, two days before the airstrike. While the presence of vessels owned by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines at Latakia is by no means unusual, it’s noteworthy that the carrier has been sanctioned by the United States for transporting military cargoes on behalf of Tehran. As for the Russian response to the Israeli raid, or lack of it, Deputy Admiral Oleg Zhuravlyov, the deputy head of the Center for Reconciliation of the Hostile Parties in Syria, a self-styled “peace monitoring center and information office,” has provided an official, if questionable explanation as to why Russian-operated air defense systems did not react. Zhuravlyov said that the Israeli attack coincided with the arrival of a Russian transport aircraft that landed near the city, presumably at the main Russian airbase in Syria at Khmeimim, less than 10 miles away. However, it is known that Russia is notified by Israel in advance of Syrian airstrikes and there exists an agreement under which its air defenses do not engage the Israeli Air Force. It seems that Zhuravlyov’s explanation was mainly directed toward the Syrian public, which has been notably vocal in its criticism of the Russian response to the airstrikes, and Moscow’s air defense policy in the country in general. Zhuravlyov also gave more details of the attack. According to the Russian official, Israeli Air Force F-16 fighters jets launched their weapons from over the Mediterranean Sea. Zhuravlyov said that two missiles were launched, although the satellite imagery above seems to clearly show four separate impact points. An Israeli Air Force pilot checks a Joint Direct Attack Munition loaded under the wing of an F-16 jet., Israeli Air Force With Israel having struck the port of Latakia twice this month, with the first such raid on December 7, the country continues to tackle the issue of suspected Iranian arms shipments head-on. It also is a reminder that Israel is ready and willing to take direct actions to stop Iran from establishing a larger military foothold in Syria and to degrade its ability to continue to bolster Hezbollah’s arms stockpiles in Lebanon.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2021",Anonymous F-35 Customer Is Getting A New Variant Of The Stealth Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Work is due to begin on a mysterious new variant of the F-35 stealth fighter for an as-yet-unnamed foreign customer. A contract announcement posted recently confirms that Lockheed Martin has received just over $49 million of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) funds to develop the unspecified “Joint Strike Fighter aircraft variant,” with speculation now focusing on what changes this could involve, and which operator it’s destined for. The full contract announcement , published online December 27, reads as follows: Lockheed Martin Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, is awarded a $49,059,494 cost-plus-incentive-fee-contract that provides engineering and other related activities in support of the design and development of a Joint Strike Fighter aircraft variant tailored for an unspecified Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customer. Work will be performed in Fort Worth, Texas (77%); Redondo Beach, California (14%); Orlando, Florida (6%); Baltimore, Maryland (1%); Owego, New York (1%) and Samlesbury, United Kingdom (1%), and is expected to be completed in December 2026. FMS funds in the amount $49,059,494 will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1). The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity (N0001922C0015). The Israeli Air Force’s uniquely outfitted test variant of the F-35I stealth fighter represents one approach to fielding a bespoke subvariant of the Joint Stike Fighter., ISRAELI AIR FORCE/AMIT AGRONOV It seems highly unlikely that the new F-35 variant would be for a new, previously unannounced customer. It would be very unusual for the United States to award a contract for the development of an F-35 variant for a customer who has not already agreed to buy the aircraft. The fact that the contract has been placed by Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) also doesn’t tell us more, since this serves not only as the contracting agency for all F-35 FMS customers but is also home to the entire F-35 Joint Program Office . Therefore, the aircraft could be a modification of the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) F-35A , or the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B . So far, there are no foreign customers for the F-35C carrier variant , which would rule out a development of this version. Most likely, we are looking at a country-specific subvariant of an F-35A or B model. However, a NATO customer is probably less likely, considering that a truly bespoke variant would be at odds with interoperability requirements within the alliance. As for what this new iteration of the Joint Strike Fighter might actually consist of, the chances are weighted highly in favor of a more modest modification, or series of changes, to suit the specific local requirements of a particular customer. After all, the price tag of $49 million for this contract is really not large in F-35 terms, especially as that covers work through December 2026. This is, of course, a program that has been regularly hit by spiraling costs that have affected export customers too. F-35 modifications to meet local demands are not unprecedented. After all, many foreign F-35 customers request certain changes to their aircraft, frequently relating to weapons capabilities, but also other features, like the drag chute found on Norway’s F-35As and which has also been selected by Finland, the most recent Joint Strike Fighter customer . An F-35A drag chute test in Norway: More radical changes are embodied in Israel’s one-off test version of its F-35I “Adir,” specially equipped to put the type’s equipment through its paces, including aircraft and weapons trials, avionics integration, and airframe modification and testing. You can read all about the background to this unique F-35 model in this previous article . In particular, the Israeli test jet will help with the introduction of Israeli-developed weapons destined for operational F-35Is, expected to include the Rafael SPICE precision-guided bomb, but potentially also air-to-air missiles and other weapons. The operational F-35Is are also adding specific communications and electronic warfare systems, which will be tested locally first. These jets are also distinct from other F-35As thanks to Israel’s ability to install its own distinct mission software and do so independent of the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), which also handles plenty of critical mission functions. The new contract may well be for the continuation of work already underway, which could apply to Israel. Back in 2018 , Lockheed won a contract to develop Israeli-specific modifications under the Block 3F+ production effort, with work due to run until the end of this year. This new contract could well serve to extend that work. Frontline Israeli Air Force F-35I jets are receiving specific avionics, electronic warfare, and weapons., ISRAELI AIR FORCE/AMIT AGRONOV Israel has in the past also looked at extending the range of its F-35I fleet by incorporating external fuel tanks and even conformal fuel tanks. Either of these would be especially useful for long-range strikes of the kind that the F-35I would likely be tasked with. The contract may have to do with integration work related to this. On the other hand, not naming the FMS customer may point to Singapore , which has ordered an initial batch of just four F-35Bs that are scheduled to be delivered in 2026 . That would not only tally with the timescale of the contract, but Singapore also often prefers not to be named in FMS contracts, citing operational security concerns . Singapore, like Israel, has traditionally required additional unique capabilities to be integrated into its fighter jets and the F-35B may be no exception. Indeed, Singapore will be the first user to operate the STOVL version of the jet exclusively from land bases and may require modifications to its aircraft to suit its unique concept of operations. The first four Singaporean jets will be used to evaluate whether the F-35 really is a good fit for the tiny country, which could also point to aircraft configured more specifically for testing purposes. In fact, Singapore could be looking to incorporate some of the same electronic warfare and/or weapons systems that Israel is installing in its F-35s, which would continue an established military relationship between those two countries. One other factor specific to Singapore is the refueling capability for the F-35B variant it has selected. The STOVL model comes with a refueling probe as standard rather than the receptacle that’s used on the Republic of Singapore Air Force’s frontline F-15SG and F-16 tactical jets — as well as on F-35As. It’s conceivable that the modifications could relate to equipping Singaporean F-35Bs with a refueling receptacle, which would provide compatibility with the boom on its A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft. While the MRTTs do feature wingtip pods for probe-and-drogue refueling, the receptacle offers much greater fuel transfer rates and could be an attractive capability for Singapore. By the same token, it’s also possible that an F-35A customer is looking to outfit its receptacle-equipped jets with refueling probes. This could be a factor for a country like Finland, a recent Joint Strike Fighter customer , whose current F/A-18C/D fighters routinely refuel from pod-equipped tankers. This is not a new proposition. Lockheed is well aware of the potential for such a modification. Canada, for instance, would likely require the same configuration if they were to buy the F-35A. This would also make sense with the work being related to a new variant, as the outright configuration would differ from its F-35A counterparts. Israel and Singapore are certainly both possible candidates for the mystery contract, but Steve Trimble, Defense Editor at Aviation Week , has pointed out that he thinks the work may be strictly limited perhaps to a handful of avionics revisions as requested by an existing customer. If that’s the case, then the wording of the contract announcement is at least curious, pointing specifically to what’s described as a “tailored” new variant of the aircraft. With that in mind, some observers have suggested that the work may refer to some previously unknown ‘downgraded’ export variant of the F-35, perhaps developed for a more sensitive customer with specific concerns around high-end capabilities or security issues . Taiwan or the United Arab Emirates would potentially fit those descriptions, but the very early nature of discussions about possible F-35 orders would also seem to make that all but impossible. While the UAE has at least been approved as a future F-35 customer, the future of such a deal hangs in the balance amid concerns over stringent safeguards to protect these systems against Chinese espionage, an issue you can read about here . There have been other contracts related to specific modifications of the F-35 for FMS customers, even just this year. However, while thin on details, these have differed from the latest announcement in elements of their wording. While the costs involved are broadly similar in each case, they have applied to modifications that apply to multiple unidentified FMS customers, rather than just one. Among these earlier contracts, one valued at $13.7 million is for “support of sustainment efforts for flight test instrumentation air systems,” which could again point to the Israeli-specific test jet. Beyond the possible need for a refueling probe on its A models, Finland has already said that its aircraft will feature some significant differences compared to other F-35As. According to the Finnish Air Force, “the solution encompasses the maintenance capabilities to be built in Finland as well as spare components and replaceable assemblies for exceptional circumstances that are under the sole national control of Finland as well as participation in the multinational maintenance network.” Another non-aligned F-35 customer, Switzerland , could conceivably also be seeking to incorporate some special modifications in its jets, and tweaking the design to use a host of specific parts would likely be within the realm of something in this price range. However, both Finland and Switzerland are expecting to get their first F-35s in 2025, a year in advance of when work will be completed under this contract. As it stands, we can only really speculate as to which F-35 customer is involved in this apparently bespoke work, while the degree of change in what’s purportedly a new variant of the jet is also unknown at this stage. Our best guess would be this pertains to giving the A model a refueling probe, necessitating its own variant terminology, but that is just a guess. We have reached out to NAVAIR for more information and will continue to bring you more details of this intriguing story just as soon as they emerge.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 30, 2021",Israel Bombards Syrian Port Of Latakia In Nighttime Strike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An Israeli airstrike on the Syrian port of Latakia early this morning targeted a cargo of “arms and munitions,” according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a U.K.-based, pro-opposition group focusing on monitoring the Syrian Civil War. The raid, which has not been acknowledged by Israel, resulted in massive explosions and a fire that burned for around 10 hours before being brought under control. So far there have been no confirmed reports of casualties. The airstrike targeted the container terminal at the port of Latakia on Syria’s Mediterranean coast at around 3:21 am local time today. Multiple sources state that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) was responsible for the attack, its aircraft launching missiles from over the Mediterranean. The port facility in Latakia. , Google Earth According to Syrian state media, this is the second such attack on the port this month and it fits the pattern of Israeli raids that have been conducted at a fairly high tempo since the start of the Syrian civil war. These have largely targeted Iranian weapons shipments intended for Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed forces in Syria and Lebanon. Firefighters work at the scene of the attack on the port of Latakia, Syria, Tuesday, December 28, 2021., SANA via AP However, the IAF has apparently only turned its attention to Latakia this month, presumably in response to the shipment of arms to supply Iranian-backed forces such as Hezbollah. The first such raid was on December 7, targeting a reported Iranian arms shipment. It is unclear what munitions the IAF employed in these attacks. While some accounts describe the use of cruise missiles, the distances and target types involved would also allow for the use of Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs), or possibly Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). “The Israeli enemy carried out an aerial aggression with several missiles from the direction of the Mediterranean … targeting the container yard in Latakia port,” an unnamed military source told the Syrian state news agency, Sana, in response to today’s attack. They added that the attack resulted in “significant material damage.” According to Syria’s state ran Sana media outlet, the blaze that ripped through the port after the attack was caused by containers carrying “engine oil and spare parts for cars and other vehicles.” However, SOHR reports that the “powerful explosions that were felt across the city of Latakia and its suburbs” were the result of detonating weapons shipments. SOHR was not able to determine where these weapons shipments originated, but Iran has a track record of delivering arms to the Syrian regime and to its own proxies operating in the country and Lebanon via Syria. As well as sending arms shipments by sea, Tehran has also used cargo aircraft and the land route via neighboring Iraq. Earlier this month it became apparent that the IAF launched cruise missiles in an unusual raid against Damascus International Airport in Syria, a facility that has been used in the past to fly in supplies to support Iranian militia and affiliates and which has come under repeated Israeli attack. The IAF now turning its attention to Latakia is a new development, however, and perhaps a direct response to Iran making greater use of maritime traffic to move its weapons shipments. That would also tally with the reported clandestine campaign of attacks waged by Israel on Iranian ships carrying oil , as well as suspected weaponry, to Syria. Based on data published by SOHR, and which remain unconfirmed, today’s attack was the 29th that has been prosecuted by Israel this year alone, resulting in 130 fatalities, of which 125 were loyalist fighters and five civilians. Israel has admitted to hitting around 50 targets in Syria this year but does not normally comment on individual strikes. A missile flies into the sky near the international airport in Damascus, Syria, on January 21, 2019. This was a rare incident in which the Israeli military issued a statement saying it is attacking Iranian military targets in Syria., SANA via AP For Israel, the campaign against targets in Syria is necessary to prevent Iran from gaining further traction in the country and using it as a springboard to launch its own attacks on Israel, often perpetrated by proxies like Hezbollah, and to interdict arms shipments that would otherwise make their way to Lebanon. Rockets, missiles, and suicide drones are some of the top threats Israel is trying to interdict. As another major player in the Syrian civil war, Russia is known to be notified by Israel in advance of certain airstrikes and its air defenses do not engage the IAF. Russia has its main airbase in Syria at Khmeimim in Latakia province, less than 10 miles away, while it has a major naval facility at Tartus, around 50 miles further south. Russian installations are protected by S-400 air defense systems which took no action during this morning’s raid. Crew members leave a Russian Tu-22M3 bomber upon its landing at Khmeimim airbase in Syria in May this year., Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also says it has “monitored great discontent among the public and supporters of the Syrian regime,” due to Russian unwillingness to comment on the Israeli airstrikes in general, let alone attempt to put a stop to them. In this context, the port of Latakia is particularly significant, in that it is one of the regime’s few major sea-trade ports providing a connection with the outside world, especially since part of Tartus was turned over to Russian military use. “Citizens, public figures, and politicians who support the Syrian regime, including a deputy in the Syrian parliament, criticized the Russian position, and expressed their dissatisfaction with the Russian position,” SOHR added. Following the previous IAF raid on the port of Latakia and against Damascus International earlier this month, it seems that Israel is indeed ramping up its campaign against Iranian activities in Syria, with an apparent focus on suspected arms shipments. Israeli officials have made it clear on numerous occasions that they see Tehran’s growing influence in the Middle East, and especially in Lebanon and Syria, as an existential threat against which it will take action at will. Now it seems, we are seeing something of a spate of airstrikes to back up that position.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Aug 4, 2023",Congress Wants Answers On The Railgun It Just Funded Even Though The Navy No Longer Wants It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the Navy made the move to defund its over-hyped, under-delivering electromagnetic railgun (EM railgun) in its 2022 budget request, Congress has provided an unsolicited lifeline to the program as part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that President Biden signed into law on December 27th, 2021. In addition, members of Congress are pushing for a full report on the exact status of the project, including how much has already been spent developing it, and what it would take to actually make the weapon operational on a ship. The War Zone was first to report that the Navy, after years of broken timelines and hollow claims from its top officers, requested to formally defund its EM railgun program last June, writing: The Navy’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget , which it released on May 28, 2021, as part of the larger U.S. military-wide request, zeroes out two separate line items related to railgun research and development. It also shows that the service did not ask for, or receive, any funding for the project through the Innovative Naval Prototypes (INP) Applied Research account in the Fiscal Year 2021 budget. It did, however, get nearly $9.5 million in requested funding, plus another $20 million that Congress decided by itself to add on top of that, through the INP Advanced Technology Development portion of the budget for that fiscal cycle. Since the Office of Naval Research (ONR) formally began work on the railgun project in 2005, funding for it has come through a number of different line items. In the past, this sometimes caused confusion and led to erroneous reports that the program had been canceled. The Navy’s plans now seem to be clear. With regards to the INP Advanced Technology Development account, the budget documents say that “the decrease in funding from FY 2021 to FY 2022 is due to the completion of Advanced Technology Development efforts under this Activity.” This line item also says that the objectives for this program in the 2022 Fiscal Year are “N/A” and does not make any mention of future work funded through other portions of the budget. “Railgun technology and knowledge attained will be documented and preserved,” according to a separate section describing the purpose of the extra funds Congress added to the program in the 2021 Fiscal Year, further indicating that the plan is now, at best, to shelve the project indefinitely. “Railgun hardware will be realigned to maximize its sustainability to facilitate potential future use.” The Navy has also moved to abandon the railgun’s primary ammunition after years of research and development. It was hoped that the high-speed projectiles would also play a role in the Navy’s standard 5-inch deck gun arsenal, as well. The 60 Minutes clip at the beginning of this video gives you an idea of the claims the Navy was making about its EM railgun program half a decade ago: Jared Keller , the commerce editor over at Task And Purpose , pointed out to us that the House Appropriations Committee has asked for a report on the Navy’s railgun within 90 days of the passage of the FY22 Defense Appropriations Bill. Clearly, the Navy’s push to defund a program it has so heavily touted as the next big thing in naval warfare for nearly a decade had ruffled some feathers. The language reads: ELECTROMAGNETIC RAILGUN PROGRAM The Committee notes that the fiscal year 2022 budget request does not include funding for the electromagnetic railgun program after the Navy has invested in the program for several years. The Committee recognizes that the development of a functional railgun has the potential to provide the Navy with a safe, effective, and significantly less expensive offensive capability than traditional legacy weapons systems. The Committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act that details the status of the electromagnetic railgun program. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the status of the development and testing of the program, the amount of funding invested to date, the funding level necessary to achieve a fully functional system in the future, and the plan to incorporate this program onto Navy ships. Artist’s rendering shows the Office of Naval Research-funded electromagnetic railgun installed aboard the expeditionary fast transport USNS Millinocket (EPF-3). Various high-ranking Navy officials promised the system would be ready for initial testing on such a craft throughout the mid-to-late 2010s., USN The $10 million Congress stuck into the NDAA for the program is tiny for such a high-tech effort. This would likely put the program in a zombie-like state, in which it is funded by Congress even after the service wanted to cut its losses, but without enough money to really advance the technology in a substantial way, let alone pay for whatever needs to be fixed so that it can enter into a truly usable operational state — that is, if such a thing is even conceivable at all. This figure is also basically what the Navy asked for to keep the program in something of a dormant-like state for fiscal year 2021, before Congress slopped $20 million on top of it. There are a number of factors that likely contribute to this situation beyond the standard pork. One of them is likely China, which has a known EM railgun program that has supposedly been tested at sea. Meanwhile, even after promises  it would go to sea for testing a half-decade ago, the U.S. Navy’s railgun prototype has not, and it appears totally dead in the water at this time. China’s EM railgun demonstrator., Chinese Internet. So, as it sits now, it looks like the railgun program will flounder on, but at least Congress will get some direct answers as to the stark realities surrounding the feasibility of the technology even after such a heavy investment. Certainly, questions as to intelligence pointing to the validity of China’s own EM railgun program will also be asked. We will continue to report on the status of this program as we learn more.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 26, 2023",U.S. Air Force E-8 JSTARS Radar Jet Flies Rare Sortie Directly Over Eastern Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even as the U.S. Air Force gears up to start disposing of its fleet of E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System ( JSTARS ) aircraft, the reconnaissance asset is still providing critical intelligence, most recently directly over Ukraine. As concerns about a possible new Russian military intervention in that country persist, an E-8C appeared on December 27th, 2021, over the east of Ukraine. We cannot say for sure if this was the type’s debut mission over the area, we believe it’s possible that it has flown a similar profile before, but it certainly is first in recent times and especially since current tensions with Russia spiked. A combination of publicly available flight-tracking data and a sharp-eyed photographer on the ground confirmed the presence of a single E-8C over Ukraine yesterday. The JSTARS, operating out of Ramstein Air Base in Germany, was using the callsign REDEYE6, and apparently flew several racetrack patterns over eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Kyiv’s forces continue to battle Russian-supported forces in a long-running conflict. Should Moscow launch a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, it would primarily do so through this contested border region, as well as potentially along other vectors . In another apparent first, the E-8C was joined on its Ukraine mission by an Air Force RC-135V Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft, callsign HOMER19, which was flying from Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete. Publicly available flight-tracking information — which is not necessarily entirely precise — suggests the Rivet Joint was operating at times as close to 40 miles from territory occupied by Russian-backed forces. However, the primary areas of interest for the U.S. intelligence-gathering aircraft would have been on the other side of the border, in Russian territory close to Ukraine. Here, according to official Ukrainian reports , there are around 100,000 Russian troops, while U.S. intelligence considers that figure to be closer to 70,000 troops. Either way, these forces are part of a major Russian military build-up in the region, which also includes heavy armor , artillery, and even long-range missiles, as well as air-defense systems . The RC-135 has been noted over eastern Ukraine previously , although it is far from a regular practice, but the presence of both JSTARS and Rivet Joint suggests these platforms were operating together to best exploit their respective capabilities. The E-8C is a battlefield management command-and-control aircraft that provides synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging — which takes image-like radar maps of the ground environment at standoff ranges — and ground-moving-target-indicator (GMTI) functions used to track the movement of vehicles, in particular. These capabilities would clearly be invaluable to monitor the disposition of Russian forces close to the Ukrainian border , to get a better idea of Moscow’s intentions and capabilities, and provide very detailed intelligence as to all of it if Russia were to begin an offensive. The view from the flight deck of an E-8C during a training exercise over the state of Georgia., U.S. Air Force/Sr. Airman Andrew Lee In contrast, the RC-135V is optimized for signals intelligence (SIGINT). It’s equipped with systems to geolocate and categorize radars and other systems associated with integrated air defenses, allowing the Rivet Joints to help build an accurate electronic order of battle , with the locations and types of enemy radars, communications nodes, electronic warfare systems, and other transmitters. The Rivet Joint is also capable of listening in on enemy communications chatter, which analysts and linguists onboard can then exploit in real-time before passing on to other units. In this way, it’s easy to imagine the benefit of having an E-8C plot the movements of Russian vehicles, while the RC-135V hoovers up and locates communications while also identifying and classifying threat emitters and other radio frequency-dependent systems. An RC-135V Rivet Joint., U.S. Air Force While the future of the RC-135 Rivet Joint fleet is secure, this is not the case for the E-8 JSTARS. Indeed, just days before REDEYE6 was flying its Ukraine mission, the Air Force confirmed its plans to dispose of four aircraft — a quarter of the JSTARS fleet — before September 2022. That move will begin the controversial retirement of the E-8C fleet, a long-running source of debate, with the aircraft being withdrawn without a direct replacement. In the defense budget request for the 2022 fiscal year, the Pentagon says the retirement of the first four JSTARS aircraft is part of wider efforts to “increase intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and command and control capability in a highly-contested environment.” “New mission requirements and capabilities are already reimagining the … battlefield,” Col. Michelle Carns, commander of the 461st Air Control Wing, said in a statement last week , reported by Air Force Times . At one point, it was expected that an all-new aircraft, based on a modern bizjet airframe , would replace the JSTARS, which entered service in the early 1990s, but use some of the oldest 707 airframes flying today. In 2018, however, the JSTARS Recap program was canceled amid fears over the vulnerability of a manned successor with limited standoff ability in the face of the kinds of high-end air defenses being developed and fielded by China and Russia. The ranges from collection areas that a manned bizjet would need to be at to remain safe would make their sensors basically irrelevant. Instead, the Air Force ultimately decided that a system of systems-focused approach based around leveraging the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) would take the place of JSTARS. ABMS began life partially as an element of a JSTARS successor, stressing ground and airborne target-tracking capabilities, but has since been further developed as a wide-ranging digital battle network system designed to collect, process, and share data among U.S. and allied forces in real-time. It involves multiple types of aircraft and satellites— all types of aircraft can be SAR and GMTI collectors today—but especially a new secretive family of aircraft that can penetrate into enemy airspace for collection , as well as types like the upcoming B-21 stealth bomber. There are also traditional strategic reconnaissance assets capable of GMTI and SAR collection that will remain in service but cannot penetrate enemy airspace, like the U-2 and Block 40 Global Hawk. Ultimately, Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, currently the only facility with permanently based JSTARS aircraft, will host an important part of the ABMS network , with an air and space “fusion center” as well as “some remotely piloted aircraft … with sensors capable of collecting and transmitting information from the battlefield.” A U.S. Air Force Block 40 RQ-4 Global Hawk., U.S. Air Force With a mature ABMS network some way off in the future, lawmakers used the 2022 defense policy bill to warn that the Air Force that retiring JSTARS before a successor is fielded would result in a loss of critical intelligence-gathering capabilities. The same bill, which President Joe Biden signed yesterday , does not prohibit the Air Force from withdrawing the E-8C, however, and the service is now working toward that goal. The U.S. Army now increasingly looks likely to step up its own airborne reconnaissance capabilities, which could also help fill the void left by the retirement of the JSTARS. Under its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System, or HADES, effort, the Army is planning on fielding a ground-surveillance radar with SAR and GMTI functions, essentially replicating some of the capabilities of the E-8C. You can read more about the HADES initiative here . One of the contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 600/650 bizjets used by the U.S. Army to test some of the types of sensors that HADES will use. These testbeds are known as Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Multi-Mission Intelligence System, or ARTEMIS., U.S. Army In the meantime, the JSTARS remains an in-demand asset to monitor global trouble spots, as evidenced by yesterday’s mission. While the Kremlin has warned the United States against deploying forces close to its borders, REDEYE6 and HOMER16 were both flying with their transponders on, making their progress visible to flight-tracking aggregators. While this would have alerted Moscow to the intent of the mission, flying with a transponder is likely a safety requirement over Donbas in particular, especially in light of the shoot-down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014. It also sends a signal to Russia that the U.S. is watching its movements very carefully. That intelligence can be quickly weaponized if need be. As well as the symbolism of these surveillance planes operating so close to Russia, the United States has also been arming Ukraine with weapons including Javelin anti-tank missiles , a pair of refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats , and small arms. Furthermore, a small Pentagon team recently returned from Ukraine after a trip there to discuss and evaluate its air and missile defense needs . Bolstering these capabilities would be critical to responding to the air and missile strikes that would likely accompany any large-scale Russian intervention. It is also conceivable that any intelligence gathered by the Rivet Joint and JSTARS would also be passed on to Ukraine. Russian claims that some of its troops have recently departed the region close to Ukraine’s border after completing planned exercises, this remains unconfirmed. With a series of talks between President Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin planned for next month, the disposition of Moscow’s forces in the wider area remains a source of concern. With that in mind, the JSTARS — and Rivet Joint — fleets are likely to be on standby for further intelligence-gathering missions in the region.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2022",Venezuela’s ‘The Thing’ Six-Barrelled Fighting Vehicle Is One Seriously Bizarre Franken-Weapon,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In what has to be one of the most unlikely comebacks in the field of military hardware, Venezuela has developed a spiritual successor to the U.S. Cold War-era M50 Ontos tank destroyer. The M50 was a tracked light armored vehicle brandishing six 106mm M40A1 recoilless rifles that first entered service with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1955 and was used with some success by that service in the Vietnam War, before being retired in 1970. The Venezuelan version is a Mad Max -style creation that brings together a hodgepodge of French AMX-13 light tank chassis, U.S. M40A1 recoilless rifles , and even scopes taken from Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles for targeting. The new fighting vehicle has been designated as the Maisanta YZR, but it’s also referred to simply as Ontos Venezuela, in a direct nod to the M50. Appropriately enough, Ontos means ‘the Thing’ in Greek. The first images of this new vehicle began to appear in the summer, with very few details available initially, but more information has trickled out gradually since then. Crew dismount the Maisanta YZR to reload the recoilless rifles. The diminutive size of the AMX-13 chassis is clear from this perspective., Venezuelan Ministry of Defense The recoilless rifles used on the Maisanta YZR are apparently the exact same kind of weapons as found on the Ontos, but they are arranged in a different pattern, with all six being mounted in a single row. In contrast, the Ontos had groups of four (top row) and two (bottom row) recoilless rifles, also on a common mount. A U.S. Marine Corps M50 Ontos during Operation Franklin in Quang Ngai province of South Vietnam in June 1966., U.S. Marine Corps The M40A1 has been in Venezuelan service since the early 1960s and has since been used as a portable, crew-served weapon as well as in a jeep-mounted form . In both the Ontos and the Maisanta YZR, the recoilless rifles need to be reloaded manually, meaning the crew has to dismount from the vehicle to prepare for the next salvo, exposing them to enemy fire. The Ontos carried 18 rounds of ammunition for its recoilless rifles and the Venezuelan vehicle likely has a broadly similar capacity. The maximum effective range of the M40A1 recoilless rifle is around 1,200 yards. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PsUkavKpfZQ It’s been reported that the Venezuelan vehicle is provided with high-explosive anti-tank, or HEAT, ammunition, which was one of the options for the Ontos, although it was only rarely employed operationally in an anti-tank role. Other ammunition options for the Ontos included a high-explosive plastic – tracer round, or HEP-T, which use a plastic explosive that conforms to the surface of a target and is optimized for unarmored targets. With this in mind, it seems the Maisanta YZR is primarily intended to knock out enemy tanks, a role in which recoilless rifles have been almost entirely eclipsed by anti-tank guided missiles, or ATGMs, in the years since Vietnam. The Maisanta YZR is equipped not only with the six recoilless rifles, but also with six 50-caliber M8C spotting rifles, compared to the four found on the old Ontos. On the U.S. vehicle, these were used to aim the recoilless rifles, the crew first lining up the rifles with their optical sights, then firing the spotting rifle, with a hit on the target being indicated by a puff of smoke. Once shown that the recoilless rifle was correctly aligned with the target, one or more of the M40A1s would be fired. The Venezuelan system takes a different approach, with separate and more modern sights mounted above the rifles.

On the prototype, there appear to be two of these sights, mounted above the second and fifth recoilless rifles. While these sniper sights have been in use since the early 1960s, they remain in production and widespread use. The foresighted sights are viewed via small close-circuit cameras and fed to what looks like a very off-the-shelf Samsung monitor in the hull of the vehicle. Another gun, mounted centrally, and separate to the recoilless rifles, is apparently a defensive machine gun, also in 50-caliber, just like was found on the original M50.

It makes use of a French AMX-13 light tank, although the particular version used is a former multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, created around a dozen of the Venezuelan tanks had their turrets removed and were instead fitted with LAR-160 rocket launchers provided by Israel’s IMI Systems. In fact, some views of the reworked vehicle suggest that there may still be an option to elevate the barrels to some degree, perhaps utilizing the same mechanism from the LAR-160, which would lend it to use as a light artillery piece, too.

Domingo Hernández Lárez (@dhernandezlarez) June 19, 2021 In one significant break from the armament concept pioneered by the Ontos, the Venezuelan counterpart also features an 81-mm caliber mortar, on a bipod, mounted on the forward part of the hull. This could potentially be used to fire smoke shells, creating a smokescreen to help conceal the vehicle. As of now, it’s not clear if the Maisanta YZR will progress beyond the prototype stage, but Venezuela’s Bolivarian Army certainly has stocks of AMX-13 chassis, both light tanks and former MLRS vehicles that could be readily adapted to the new configuration. With the tank-mounted LAR-160 now decommissioned, at least two of these vehicles have also been adapted to produce a mine-clearance vehicle , with a front-mounted flail to detonate mines. Should Venezuela take the decision to produce more examples of the Maisanta YZR, it would certainly be an unusual step and one that doesn’t immediately appear to have serious combat potential. After all, other armies in Latin America are already equipped with advanced ATGMs, such as the Rafael Spike found in neighboring Colombia, and a tank destroyer with recoilless rifle armament is anachronistic at best.

Domingo Hernández Lárez (@dhernandezlarez) June 11, 2021 On the other hand, if the Maisanta YZR were to be provided with alternative ammunition, like the HEP-T rounds, it could potentially provide a useful fire-support weapon, especially for urban environments, albeit one that lacks the survivability of a modern armored vehicle. With the right kinds of ammunition, the recoilless rifles would be able to punch through walls or other obstacles. It’s notable that the Ontos achieved most of its success in Vietnam in the direct fire-support role, working alongside infantry, and Venezuela could potentially adopt similar tactics. Alternatively, the Maisanta YZR could be used in a static defensive role, to protect key objectives, for example, another role that was carried out with some success in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, 106mm rounds, as long as they can still be sourced, are drastically cheaper than missiles. There has been a suggestion in the past that spare parts and perhaps ammunition for the recoilless rifles have been provided to Venezuela by Iran, where the M40 is manufactured by the Defense Industries Organization .

These measures have combined with an ongoing economic crisis to put most modern military equipment out of reach of the armed forces. The army has instead been forced to repair and refurbish the old equipment available to it, even if the results are not necessarily highly viable for modern warfare.

Brian O'Rourke,"Updated on Dec 27, 2021",Enlisted SEAL Team Six Operators Piloted Leased Aircraft According To Founder Richard Marcinko,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The death of Richard Marcinko — the “Rogue Warrior” — on Christmas Day has sparked a lot of interest in his life. Marcinko was the controversial, larger-than-life, highly decorated Navy SEAL who founded the elite counterterrorism-focused SEAL Team Six in 1980. In 2016, Marcinko gave an extensive interview to SOFREP.com in which he offered an intriguing detail about the unique composition of the initial cadre of Naval Special Warfare operators. He says that he had some of his enlisted “shooters” also trained as pilots who flew aircraft the team leased directly, outside the Department of Defense’s normal bureaucratic channels. In Marcinko’s words, this was “a point of contention,” presumably with ‘Big Navy,’ because “enlisted men were flying airplanes, not officers. And they were leased aircraft; they weren’t Navy aircraft.” The Navy, like all the armed services, has had enlisted pilots, but it’s rarely been a job for enlisted personnel that’s been welcomed by service leaders. A decade ago, the Navy commemorated the history of naval aviation with a special historical publication, “Centennial of Naval Aviation.” In the Fall 2010 edition, Force Master Chief James Delozier recounted the history of “naval aviation pilots,” the designation given to enlisted ratings who received naval flight training. Delozier’s story of Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard ratings with wings ends in 1981, with the retirement of Navy Chief Robert K. “NAP” Jones, who retired that January. At no point in the program did the number of NAPs ever exceed a few hundred in any of the services, and no new enlisted pilots had been trained since Congress ended the program in 1948, more than 30 years before Marcinko’s tenure at Seal TEAM Six. What makes Marcinko’s story remarkable is that, as he tells it in the interview, he just went ahead and did it, outside normal channels, apparently never bothering to get his pilots official Navy flight training. While this may have been very ‘on-brand’ for Marcinko’s notorious maverick style, it is amazing to think Navy enlisted personnel were flying SEALs around in the 1980s, albeit pilots very few would have known about at the time. “I leased civilian airplanes and ran them through stunt school,” Marcinko says. SEALs leap out of a cargo transport during an overwater jump., U.S. Navy His reasoning was straightforward. In an aircraft hostage situation in the United States, different agencies are in charge of events on different sides of the aircraft door. Today, he says, if the door is open, the FBI is in charge. If it’s closed, it’s the Air Marshals. “Who’s going to fly me in if I have to do a takedown?” he asks. “So that’s why I want to fly on my own planes,” he says. “My pilot is a shooter that knows what’s going to be best for him.” He added that the team had helicopters, piston-engine airplanes, and turboprops. “But it was the function — you’re self-contained.” He goes on to note that, “when this big C-5A comes in, it casts a big shadow. You’re not sneaking up on anybody doing that, when you fly into a big commercial site.” A Navy SEAL carrying an MP5 on a ship assault training mission in the early 1990s. , USN Given Marcinko’s “Rogue Warrior” persona, it’s might not be surprising, then, that he reports that the Navy didn’t like his rogue air force. “To get control, the Navy … looked at absorbing my leased planes,” he says. “But then they learned that” this would affect the statutorily authorized number of aircraft the Navy could have. “They would have [had] to lose five of their real aircraft so they could have control of my makeshift dogs and cats.” The interview is a fascinating story of a very likely brief return of enlisted aviators to the Navy, however far outside of normal channels it may have been.

Brian O'Rourke,"Posted on Dec 28, 2021",SEAL Team Six Founder Richard Marcinko Has Died,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Richard Marcinko, the decorated but controversial founder and first commanding officer of SEAL Team Six, died December 25 at the age of 81. The New York Times reports that Marcinko’s son, Matthew, attributed his father’s death on Christmas night to a heart attack. Marcinko, who had a legendarily ‘colorful’ personality, served in the U.S. Navy from 1958 to 1989, and was the author of numerous fiction and non-fiction works on the SEALs, leadership, and counterterrorism. He also spent time in prison on charges of defrauding the federal government, though he maintained his innocence. According to a web biography , at the age of 18, Marcinko enlisted in the Navy after reportedly being rejected by the Marine Corps for not having a high school diploma. The Navy made him a radioman for three years, and then he attended Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS), from which he graduated in October 1961, a few months before President John F. Kennedy formally established the “Sea, Air, and Land” (SEAL) commandos in 1962. Marcinko was assigned to an Underwater Demolition Team upon graduation from BUDS and attended Officer Candidate School in 1965. Cdr. Richard Marcinko in an undated official portrait, U.S. Navy via Wikimedia Marcinko served two tours in Vietnam with SEAL Team Two. According to the National Navy UDT/SEAL Team Museum , Marcinko’s first deployment, in 1967 led to his first commendations for gallantry in combat: In January 1967, Marcinko deployed to Vietnam with 2nd Platoon, SEAL Team TWO. On May 18, 1967, Marcinko led his men in an assault on Ilo Ilo Hon where they killed many Viet Cong and destroyed six of their sampans. This became known as the Navy’s most successful SEAL operation in the Mekong Delta. Because of his strong leadership and great success, the North Vietnamese Army placed a bounty on his head, payable to anyone who could capture and kill him. Marcinko was never caught; he went on to be awarded the first of four Bronze Stars, as well as a Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and the Silver Star. Marcinko returned to Vietnam in late 1967, just ahead of the January 1968 Tet Offensive. During the early phases, Marcinko’s SEAL Team Two assisted U.S. Army Special Forces at Châu Đốc. The SEAL Museum reports : “What began as an urban street battle evolved into an intense rescue mission of American nurses and a schoolteacher trapped in the city’s church and hospital.” After Vietnam, Marcinko returned to the United States. In 1979, when the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was captured during the Iranian Revolution and staffers and U.S. Marine guards were taken hostage, Marcinko was chosen as one of two members of the Navy to work with the Joint Staff to plan a hostage rescue. After the attempted rescue — Operation Eagle Claw — failed, the Navy decided it needed a permanent anti-terrorist force and tapped Marcinko to form it. Marcinko named that unit “SEAL Team Six,” despite the Navy having only two other SEAL Teams, to confuse enemy intelligence about the size and number of Naval Special Warfare units. He later formed the Red Cell team, which invasively tested security at U.S military and intelligence facilities. According to a profile in People magazine, Marcinko says Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James “Ace” Lyons tasked Marcinko with forming the unit to stage “mock attacks on military installations here and abroad and [expose] their security flaws.” “I’d tell them Red Cell was coming, eat them alive, and then show the film and rub their noses in it,” Marcinko told People. SOFREP has a great little series done with Richard Marcinko in 2016 that is worth checking out: Marcinko retired from the Navy as a commander in 1989. His Navy awards included the Silver Star, the bronze star with gold combat V device and three gold stars (indicating four total bronze star awards), and two Navy Commendation Medals with combat V device, as well as the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star. But it was the rubbing of noses with Red Cell to which Marcinko later attributed his legal troubles, In 1990, he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government, for which he was sentenced to 21 months in prison. He was released after serving 15 months. He told 60 Minutes ’ Mike Wallace in 1992 that “he was singled out for prosecution because he embarrassed Navy officials” with his Red Cell exploits. The Navy denied the existence of a vendetta, and Lyons told People : “Dick can get carried away.” After his release, Marcinko, who was also known as “Demo Dick,” became a celebrated author of bestselling SEAL team fiction, as well as the autobiography Rogue Warrior . Marcinko also had numerous other business endeavors from entertainment to security to speaking engagements. Richard Marcinko signs a copy of his book Rogue Warrior: Curse of the Infidel at in August 2014., Gabe Ginsberg/FilmMagic via Getty Images Despite his passing, Marcinko’s legacy lives on. The anti-terrorism unit he founded — formally known these days as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group , or DEVGRU — still answers to “SEAL Team Six” informally. And it was this unit that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, long after Marcinko’s 1989 retirement. Many of the team’s and Marcinko’s other exploits will likely remain forever in the shadows, but perhaps a few more stories may appear in the coming days and weeks, as Marcinko’s former comrades and successors remember the controversial ‘larger than life’ fallen warrior.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Aug 2, 2021",Iran Rained Down Ballistic Missiles On A Mockup Of Israel’s Nuclear Reactor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Dramatic video has emerged from Iranian state television showing recent tests of ballistic missiles and other weapons aimed against targets that include a rough mockup of Israel’s nuclear facility near Dimona in the Negev Desert. In one remarkable sequence, the warhead of what appears to be a Dezful medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) leaves an impressively fiery trail behind it immediately before it impacts the target. The footage comes from a five-day exercise known as Great Prophet 17, carried out in southern Iran, which came to an end last Friday. The war games were intended as an explicit warning to Israel in light of Tehran’s worries over possible Israeli plans to target Iran’s own nuclear sites. With that in mind, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) carried out the attack on the mockup of Dimona nuclear complex, home to a secretive Israeli nuclear reactor, while official video combined this with a digital mock-up showing an aerial view of the Israeli site. “Through a simulation of the Dimona atomic facilities, the Revolutionary Guards successfully practiced attacking this critical center of the Zionist regime in its missile exercise,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency stated. Exactly how realistic that mockup of Dimona was is questionable, with a clear physical resemblance to the nuclear reactor but apparently little in the way of a substantial structure. According to Iran’s Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the culmination of the maneuvers included the simultaneous launch of 16 ballistic missiles as well as 10 Shahed-136 loitering munitions , or ‘suicide drones,’ which are also shown being deployed from previously unseen box-like launchers, each containing five drones and mounted on a truck. Iranian-backed Houthi forces operating in Yemen have previously used unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of a similar type. With long-endurance capabilities, these weapons would potentially be able to reach Israel, but they could be launched in Syria or even Lebanon for a far less lengthy trip. “We will cut off their hands if they make a wrong move,” warned Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of the IRGC. “The difference between actual operations and military exercises is only a change in the angles of launching the missiles.” In the accompanying video, the rear portion of one of the missiles aimed at the Dimona mockup can be seen leaving a bright orange trail behind it, an instant before it impacts the target, which has already been shook by the detonation of the warhead from a previous missile. Observers have offered a range of explanations for what this fiery phenomenon might be, with some suggesting it could be a plasma sheath. This is an effect that’s been noted with other very-high-speed projectiles in the Earth’s atmosphere. It’s especially prevalent when a fairly blunt projectile is moving with a very high velocity, creating an enormous shockwave that in turn heats the air around it, resulting in a telltale plasma build-up. It has also been suggested that the effect might be the result of water condensing around the fast-moving warhead. Other open-source intelligence observers have suggested that what we are seeing is the combustion of the composite materials used in the guidance fins at the rear of the Dezful MRBM due to the high temperatures encountered during its terminal attack phase. There is also a curious point around the five-second mark in the video embedded in the tweet below when the fiery missile becomes distorted. Some observers have attributed this to the detonation of the previous missile, and the resulting blast wave, but others suggest the same shockwave led to a simple glitch in the digital recording. As for the Dezful, most sources agree that this is the missile used in the mock attack on the Israeli nuclear facility. A derivative of the Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missile, the Dezful similarly features a single-stage solid-propellant motor whose range has been extended to around 620 miles. The missile was unveiled in February 2019, during celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Republic, when examples were displayed in an underground missile facility . The Iranian ballistic missile threat, in general, has come to greater prominence since then, above all due to the unprecedented ballistic missile strikes against Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, which involved Qiam-1 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) hitting the base with impressive accuracy . Meanwhile, Iran using its military to make threats against Israel is nothing new, but it’s significant that these latest exercises pointed explicitly to Iran’s nuclear infrastructure as a target. Also of interest is the fact that the IRGC has shown off apparent plans to use ballistic missiles in combination with drones to attack the Dimona facility. In the past, as during the attack on Saudi Arabian energy facilities in 2019, Iranian drones have been used together with cruise missiles to hit key infrastructure. The Houthis claimed responsibility for those attacks, but there is widespread agreement that they were orchestrated by Tehran. The ‘layering’ of high-end and lower-end capabilities of vastly different performance capabilities greatly complicates defending against a potential strike. Also, the weapon used can be better tailored for the target it is intended for. On the other hand, there is a huge difference between blowing up an apparent cinder-block bunker structure on a range as part of a military exercise and an attack on a genuine Israeli facility far away that would also have to deal with that country’s highly advanced air defense network, which includes anti-ballistic missile capabilities that are expressly designed to fend off exactly this type of offensive. After all, Iran has on more than one occasion destroyed a mocked-up U.S. Navy aircraft carrier , in an event that was clearly tailored at least as much for propaganda value as it was a genuine reflection of military capabilities. With that in mind, it seems at least highly probable that the Dimona attack exercise was just as much of a symbolic act as one used for training and testing. The notorious fake aircraft carrier explodes during a 2015 exercise in Iran., AP As for the standoff between Iran and Israel, that shows no signs of abating. Israel continues to oppose efforts to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran — more formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This deal had provided for a partial lifting of sanctions imposed on Iran in exchange for the country reducing its nuclear activities and opening up its facilities for enhanced inspections. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the JCPOA in 2018. While the current administration under President Joe Biden has advocated a return to the terms of the 2015 deal, Israel doesn’t think the deal goes far enough. For example, the JCPOA does not put limits on Iran’s ballistic-missile development program. Israeli officials have threatened military action against Iranian nuclear infrastructure if diplomacy fails. Talking to the BBC in November, an anonymous Israeli security official said: “In light of Iranian progress of their nuclear program, we are preparing for all options and scenarios, including military capabilities.” Israel also has a track record of long-range attacks on the burgeoning nuclear infrastructure in countries it has deemed to be threatening, launching airstrikes on Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. The stakes involved in a pre-emptive Israeli strike against Iran would be much higher, however, not least due to Tehran’s stated willingness to respond with its own ballistic missiles, drones, and other capabilities, including a network of proxies across the Middle East that it arms and supports. Iranian nuclear infrastructure — as well as ballistic missiles — is also increasingly hardened against attack, including expansive underground sites. Israel, however, has other options at its disposal as it seeks to curtail the potential for Iranian nuclear weapons. In the past, Israel has been blamed for high-profile assassinations of key figures in the Iranian nuclear program, including Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, described as the “ father of Iran’s nuclear bomb .” In November 2020, Fakhrizadeh was killed — reportedly by Israel’s top intelligence agency Mossad or individuals working on its behalf — in a complex attack on the car he was traveling in. There have also been cyberattacks against Iranian nuclear infrastructure that appear to have originated in Israel and apparent kinetic attacks on Iranian facilities, including at Natanz in July last year. At the same time, Israel continues to conduct airstrikes against Iranian forces in Syria. For its part, Tehran has long insisted that its nuclear program is civilian rather than military in nature. However, before a new round of nuclear talks began, Iran revealed it had achieved 60 percent purity for its enriched uranium, almost the level required to build a functioning nuclear weapon. While negotiations around an Iranian nuclear deal continue in Vienna, it seems that Tehran’s latest war games — with their explicit threat toward Israel’s nuclear program — are intended as a highly visible reminder that its military, and especially its ever more capable ballistic missile and suicide drone forces, is prepared to respond in kind should Israel run out of patience and decide to strike Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Ahead of Christmas this year, the Air Force Research Laboratory has put out a lighthearted computer-generated video of a system it has “developed” to help Santa deliver gifts to children around the world. While clearly meant to help people get into the holiday spirit, just like with the “reveal” of a similarly fictional Hypersleigh two years ago, the fictitious Global Interconnected Flight Transport, or GIFT, isn’t that far off from very real concepts that the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force are exploring now, chiefly the Rocket Cargo program . Rocket Cargo, which The War Zone was first to report on , is a novel logistics concept that envisions being able to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo and potentially personnel anywhere in the world within one hour. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) posted the GIFT video on social media yesterday. “After weeks of research, collaboration and test launches the day has finally arrived…to showcase the North Pole’s new G.I.F.T. system!” reads an official Tweet. GIFT is depicted as a ground-launched rocket with the word “NOEL” written on its body along with the Air Force and Space force logos, among others. The video then goes on to show a group of them releasing their payloads of presents. The Hypersleigh , which has a delta-wing planform reminiscent of real manned and unmanned hypersonic flight vehicle concepts , but with the addition of sleigh-like landing skids and a Christmas-themed paint job, also makes an appearance. A reference is also made to AFRL’s Roving Organizational Surveillance Assistant (ROSA), the lab’s play on the popular Elf on the Shelf , who the lab has previously said was involved in “testing” of the Hypersleigh. GIFT is, of course, obviously not a serious thing. Neither is the present-laden Hypersleigh. At the same time, the Hypersleigh reflected a very real interest on the part of the Air Force in 2019 in potentially reusable manned and unmanned hypersonic aircraft that could meet a variety of different operational requirements. The service is still actively pursuing those kinds of capabilities. Just this week, The War Zone reported on the latest details to emerge about the Air Force’s secretive Mayhem project . Everything we’ve learned so far about Mayhem, which AFRL is managing, points to a project to craft demonstrators to support the development of hypersonic aircraft capable of carrying out strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. As silly as the GIFT idea of rockets raining presents down from space might seem, it also represents a very real area of study that AFRL, in cooperation with the Space Force and U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), is looking into right now through Rocket Cargo . The basic idea would be to develop a rocket-based logistics system of some kind to enable the rapid transport of payloads up to 100 tons, a core requirement based on the maximum cargo load of a C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft, to any location globally in 60 minutes or less. How all of this would be done, and done in a cost-effective and otherwise practical manner, very much remains to be seen, as The War Zone has explored in-depth in the past. A graphical depiction of a notional Rocket Cargo concept of operations utilizing reusable rocket boosters and spacecraft., SPACEWORKS ENTERPRISES VIA USAF Regardless, there is a clear commitment to this project, at least in the near term. Earlier this year, the Department of the Air Force, of which Space Force is a part, declared that this program was the fourth of its so-called “Vanguard” initiatives . It created this label to highlight high-priority projects. The other three Vanguards are the Skyborg program , which is developing an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” and associated systems that will be able to operate semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones and potentially fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), as well as the Golden Horde networked munitions project and the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) advanced space-based navigation system effort. Private industry has shown interest in being involved in this effort, as well. In October 2020, before the Rocket Cargo program or Space Force had formally come into existence, TRANSCOM had signed Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) with space launch company SpaceX and space consulting firm XArc to help kickstart work on similar logistics concepts. This October, Blue Origin , another space launch company, revealed that it was in talks with TRANSCOM about its own potential CRADA. Relevant Air Force contracting documents have said that the Rocket Cargo plan, at least right now, is “solely focused on leveraging commercial rocket capabilities as a leased service.” Official artwork AFRL has released in relation to the Rocket Cargo program, depicting a rocket delivering humanitarian assistance., USAF So, while AFRL using GIFT to spread holiday cheer around the globe may not actually be a thing, it is very interested in whether or not it can turn the idea of sending other payloads to locations around the world in relatively short amounts of time into a reality.

Brian O'Rourke,"Updated on Oct 26, 2021",The Saga Of The Navy’s Newest Carrier’s Problem-Plagued Weapons Elevators Appears To Be Over,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy announced today that the final advanced weapons elevator on the USS Gerald R. Ford has been declared fully functional. The 11 elevators on the service’s newest aircraft carrier, which permit movement of ordnance from the ship’s magazines to the aircraft, have been a continuing problem since before the Ford was officially commissioned in 2017. With the announcement from the Program Executive Office – Aircraft Carriers, the Navy has kept a commitment it made this past summer to complete the elevators in 2021, and it has removed a major obstacle to the carrier’s expected first deployment in 2022 . As recently as August 2021, only seven of the elevators were considered fully operational . At that time, the Navy announced its expectation that the remaining elevators would be functional by the end of 2021. Then-Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer is briefed by Lt. Cdr. Chabonnie Alexander, USS Gerald R. Ford ’s (CVN-78) ordnance handling officer, on the Upper Stage 1 advanced weapons elevator during a tour of the aircraft carrier in 2018. , U.S. Navy / MC2 Kiana A. Raines The elevators are one of several new technologies incorporated into the carrier. Traditional carrier elevators use hydraulics and mechanical linkages — cables — to raise and lower platforms. According to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), the Ford ’s advanced elevators replace those maintenance-intensive and comparatively slow elevators with ones run by electromagnetic motors. With fewer moving parts, the system should in principle be less complex to operate. However, the manufacturing tolerances for such a system require greater accuracy and precision than a purely mechanical one. According to the Congressional Research Service , the Navy and builders struggled to incorporate such tolerances and, in 2019, the Navy told Bloomberg that as many as 70 elevator doors and 17 hatches did not meet requirements because of how changes to the ship have evolved. Without fully functioning weapons elevators, a carrier will struggle to generate the desired sortie rate because it will take too long to move weapons from the magazines to aircraft on deck. The elevators are not the only major problem the Ford has had to resolve. Among other issues, the Navy has addressed the ship’s waste management — its toilets overflow — as well as propulsion and electrical systems . In April, the Navy announced that the ship’s formerly troublesome Advanced Arresting Gear and Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System had accumulated 8,000 launch and recovery cycles, an important turnaround for another system that had plagued the carrier from early on, and another that directly affects how quickly the carrier can launch and recover aircraft. Not all is right with the ship, however. It is years away from being able to operate F-35Cs , the Navy’s carrier-borne version of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy’s explanation for this, according to Breaking Defense , is that Ford was laid down in November 2009, with a design that had been finalized even earlier, while the F-35C was still in relatively early development. The upshot is that at least the first two carriers in the Ford class — the Gerald R. Ford and the future John F. Kennedy — will need retrofitting and upgrades to carry the Navy’s most advanced strike fighters. In a December 2021 report, the Congressional Research Service estimated the cost of the Ford at $13.3 billion, and the future Kennedy at $11.9 billion. According to a November 2020 contract award , the Navy has committed some $285 million to ensuring “a single-phase delivery approach to meet both Fleet requirements and a congressional mandate of ensuring that CVN 79 [the Kennedy ] is capable of operating and deploying Joint Strike Fighter (F-35C) aircraft before completing the post-shakedown availability.” The award specified a targeted completion date of June 2024. According to Dailypress.com , the Ford is expected to be ready for F-35Cs in 2025. The ship needs changes to multiple systems, including jet-blast deflectors, handling-and-stowage facilities, and lithium-ion battery handling gear. The carrier’s development under former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s “ Revolution in Military Affairs ” created ample amounts of risk in the hopes of generating considerable opportunity. For the Navy, abandoning its traditional “ spiral development ” approach — building incremental improvements on established systems — clearly has slowed the replacement of the Nimitz -class aircraft carriers that remain the backbone of the fleet. In October 2019, then-Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer lost his cool about Congress and shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries at a Brookings Institute event in Washington, as public criticism of the problems reached a crescendo. Spencer had previously suggested in January 2019 then-President Donald Trump should fire him if the elevators were not fixed quickly. So, even if the Navy succeeds at its current plan to deploy the Ford for the first time in 2022 — four years late — it will be some time before the service will be able to judge if the tradeoff was ultimately worth it.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 22, 2021",Ukrainian Troops Test Javelin Missile Against Russian Cage-Style Improvised Tank Armor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Ukrainian Army continues to refine its anti-armor tactics using its American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles . Recent trials pitted the weapon against a static target equipped with improvised protection similar to the type that’s been appearing on the turrets of some Russian tanks of late, including those noted close to Ukraine’s border areas. That is a topic that you can read about in our previous article here . The new Javelin test comes as fears about a new Russian military intervention on Ukrainian territory grow and as Kyiv continues to battle Russian-supported forces in the eastern Donbas region, including using Javelin missiles. The video of the Javelin live-fire exercise appeared today on the Facebook page of Ukraine’s Joint Forces Press Service. More details have been provided on the page of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which notes that the maneuvers took place on a training range in the east of the country, close to the front lines. The target was engaged at a distance of around 1 mile, although the missile has a demonstrated ability to hit targets up to nearly three miles away in the past. The troops involved had apparently not fired the Javelin before and were training prior to being deployed in Donbas. Of particular interest, however, is the target that’s shown being engaged. This appears to be a Cold War-era tank turret — perhaps from a T-64 — mounted on what looks like the chassis of a BTR-series armored personnel carrier . Before: the tank target with metal slat armor on the sides as well as the cage structure on top of the turret., Ukrainian Joint Forces Press Service And after: the remains of the tank target after being hit by two Javelin missiles., General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Atop the turret is the same type of ad-hoc cage armor that has been increasingly appearing on Russian tanks recently , as seen in the examples below, the first of which was apparently spotted in Russian-occupied Crimea. The tank target is also fitted with the side-mounted slat armor of the type that has become a familiar sight during the ongoing conflicts in Libya and Syria, and in Iraq, primarily to defend against side-on attacks from high-explosive anti-tank rounds, especially those fired from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). In the video, one missile appears to miss, but the target takes one Javelin hit, leaving much of the top-mounted cage armor ripped off and the hull burning, representing its successful destruction. What is not clear, however, is how representative this target is, at least compared with the up-armored tanks that have been noted recently in Russian service. The target on the Ukrainian range was seemingly not fitted with any additional defensive measures, such as explosive reactive armor (ERA) , let alone more advanced countermeasures, such as active protection systems that are designed to detect an incoming projectile and launch a countermeasure of some type. Meanwhile, its basic level of armor protection is at least a generation behind the oldest tanks likely to be fielded by Russia in any confrontation, and the fact that the target apparently combines both tank and BTR components suggests only limited robustness overall. On top of that observation, we have no idea how long this target had been used for, with or without the addition of the cage on top. By their nature, range targets like this may be hit dozens of times before finally being destroyed, even if only by small-arms fire, further undermining their resilience. Furthermore, as we discussed in the past, although the Javelin missile attacks from above (which can be seen clearly at one point in the video), it’s likely that the turret-mounted cage armor is primarily intended to protect against attacks by loitering munitions and other armed unmanned aircraft . At the same time, as we previously pointed out, the additional armor on top could still decrease the effectiveness of certain top-attack guided missiles to at least some degree. The Javelin can be fired straight at a target or via a pop-up maneuver, after which it dives down onto the target, exploiting the typically more limited armor protection on top of tanks and armored vehicles. A still from the Ukrainian live-fire exercise shows the Javelin engaging the target with a top-attack maneuver., Ukrainian Joint Forces Press Service While the metal structures atop a tank turret could potentially interfere with the Javelin’s detonation sequence, and reduce the probability of a kill, the cage armor alone is unlikely to offer substantial protection against an advanced anti-tank guided missile of this kind. That analysis would seem to be borne out by the video, once again with the caveat that this is very much an extemporized target and not representative of the full degree of armor protection commonly found on frontline Russian tanks. With that in mind, it’s quite possible that the video published by the Joint Forces Press Service, and the exercise itself, was intended as much for propaganda value as it was a meaningful test of the Javelin against Russian armor practices. Ukrainian troops prepare a Javelin for firing on the range, with the reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU), within integral thermal imaging system, seen at left., Ukrainian Joint Forces Press Service Ukraine’s acquisition of the Javelin missile has already been assessed as being a significant factor in any future major military confrontation with Russia. The missile has already been combat-tested in Ukrainian hands. Last month, the head of Ukraine’s top military intelligence agency confirmed that troops in the Donbas region had fired Javelins against Russian or Russian-supported forces . The background to the U.S. government’s decision to approve the sale of Javelins to Ukraine in 2018 was a major shift in policy . It was only last year, however, that the U.S. government allowed Ukrainian troops to field these weapons on the front lines in Donbas, so long as they were used “defensively.” Previously, Ukraine was only allowed to deploy the missiles in the case of a major Russian invasion of the country. Firing a Javelin at the range in eastern Ukraine., Ukrainian Joint Forces Press Service Now that the Javelin has been employed in combat by Ukraine, the country will no doubt be seeking to capitalize on the significant psychological deterrent value that they offer, as a warning against any potential aggression. The timing of this video is significant in itself, with much attention now focused on Russia’s positioning of heavy armor , artillery, air defense systems , and even long-range missiles in its border areas close to Ukraine. At the same time, U.S. intelligence has warned that the number of Russian troops deployed in the region is likely to grow to approximately 175,000 troops, with plans for a multi-front offensive as soon as early next year. This is not the first time that Russia has made large-scale deployments of troops and materiel to territory opposite Ukraine, with similar movements in April also leading to fears of a potential invasion. For now, though, tensions are once again high, with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin stressing only today that he would be willing to launch an intervention if he felt that Ukraine or its western allies were themselves gearing up for an attack on Russia’s proxies in the country. Putin has also made various other highly concerning assertions and demands that were not made during the troop buildup a year ago. Should Russian ground forces roll across the border, then the Ukrainian Army’s Javelin missiles would be a critical line of defense to try and blunt any armored invasion. On the other hand, even if tensions are reduced, Kyiv remains actively engaged against separatists in the east of the country, where heavy armor has been an important feature of a conflict in which the Javelin is now combat-proven.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The experimental X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology aircraft, or QueSST, which Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works is building for NASA , is now on its way to the company’s plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Once there, the jet, which is being designed to explore sonic-boom-mitigating technologies that could have significant impacts on the future of supersonic flight, will undergo structural testing ahead of a planned first flight next year. Photographer Aldo Boccaccio grabbed pictures of the aircraft under wraps on a semi-trailer in Marana, Arizona earlier this week and was kind enough to share them with us. The plane has been under construction at Skunk Work’s facility at the U.S. Air Force’s Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, since 2018. Lockheed Martin confirmed to The War Zone that the current plan is to truck the X-59 to its Texas plant, which is best known for hosting the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter assembly line , for structural tests before bringing it back to Palmdale for the initial round of flight testing. It does seem somewhat curious that such a fragile, one-off design would be moved via road instead of something like a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport plane . Aldo Boccaccio Aldo Boccaccio Aldo Boccaccio The purpose of the X-59 and the QueSST program, as the name implies, is to explore technologies that could be able to dramatically reduce the sound and the felt impact of sonic booms on planes flying faster than the speed of sound. As The War Zone has explained in the past , the disruptive noise and shaking that planes flying above the speed of sound produce remain key impediments to viable commercial supersonic aircraft . These issues also impose restrictions on military training involving supersonic aircraft and ‘quieting’ the booms could be beneficial during combat operations , as well. The X-59, which is meant to be a purely experimental testbed, is an intriguing design that makes heavy use of components from other Lockheed Martin aircraft to help keep the design as simple and low-cost as possible. “Landing gear from an Air Force F-16 fighter , a cockpit canopy from a NASA T-38 trainer , a propulsion system part from a U-2 spy plane and a control stick from an F-117 stealth fighter are among the repurposed parts to be used on NASA’s newest airplane,” according to NASA . It is powered by a single modified General Electric F414 engine, other variants of which are found on Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets, as well as the Saab Gripen fighter jet , among others. An artist’s conception of the X-59., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Only around 10% of the design is entirely new, Skunk Works representatives told The War Zone and other reporters during a tour of its facilities at Palmdale earlier this year. At the same time, we were informed that this aircraft has been used to help prove out new advanced manufacturing techniques, including with regards to the large, single-piece composite skins on its wings. The X-59 was the first project at Skunk Works to actually make use of new, high-tolerance, and highly automated robotic drilling and tapping capabilities, which you can read more about here . A Combined Operation: Bolting and Robotic AutoDrill system, or COBRA, works on the X-59’s wing at Plant 42., Lockheed Martin One of the design’s more unusual features is the complete lack of any forward visibility for the pilot. Instead, the individual flying the X-59 will use a remote vision system, called the eXternal Vision System (XVS), to “see” via the feeds from an array of forward-facing high-resolution cameras. This configuration allows for the entire front end of the aircraft to be optimized even more for sonic-boom-mitigating supersonic flight. A picture from a simulator test of the XVS for the X-59., NASA NASA’s official timeline says that the X-59’s first flight is expected sometime next year. Lockheed Martin could not immediately provide an update on exactly when the plane might take to the air for the first time. The initial flight testing, which will demonstrate things like the basic airworthiness of the aircraft, is expected to take nine months and run into 2023. After that, NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, which is situated within Edwards Air Force Base in California, will formally take delivery of the plane and then move on to its own initial test phase to hopefully demonstrate the design’s quiet supersonic capabilities. Skunk Works representatives told The War Zone and others who attended the tour at Plant 42 earlier this year that the goal is for the X-59 flying at supersonic speeds overhead to sound and feel like nothing more than someone “closing a car door” to people on the ground. Public feedback will be solicited during the Community Response Study phase, which is set to take place between 2024 and 2026 and will involve flights over various U.S. cities. Push notifications will be used to alert people on the ground about X-59 flights and collect responses. In some cases, individuals will be told that the plane has gone zooming overhead when in reality that is not the case in order to try to identify the potential for “false positive” type responses and other outliers in the data. All told, the X-59 program looks set to have a particularly exciting 2022.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 1, 2022",How The Russian And Ukrainian Air Forces Stack Up Against Each Other,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With Ukrainian officials continuing to warn that Russia might be just weeks away from launching a new major military intervention against their country, the relative military strengths of the two countries are currently under wider scrutiny. Were Moscow to initiate a new offensive against its neighbor, it is likely to draw upon the approximately 175,000 troops among the ground forces that are expected to be deployed in the region, as well as missile strikes and potentially naval elements . But Russia would not attempt any significant military action without extensive use of airpower. With that in mind, now is a prime opportunity to take a detailed look at the respective aviation assets that can be brought to bear by Russia and Ukraine in the region, and how their capabilities compare. Russian military aviation assets The Russian Armed Forces are organized within five military districts, which are administrative organizations based on geographical territories, each with a headquarters that administers the military formations based in that region. In a worst-case scenario for a new Russian intervention, as outlined by Ukrainian military intelligence in November , Russian forces would cross the Ukrainian border from the east and attack via annexed Crimea in the south, as well as launching an amphibious assault on the city of Odessa. An attack from Belarus in the north is also possible but would involve troops that have not yet arrived in the region. Regardless, any such plan would likely involve ground forces — and air assets — from two separate military districts. A Russian Aerospace Force Su-35S fighter blasts off from Besovets airbase during a live-fire exercise., Russian Ministry of Defense Much of Russia’s border areas with Ukraine, as well as the critical frontiers with the NATO member states of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, come under the military responsibility of the Western Military District, or WMD. This is unsurprisingly the most important of Russia’s territorial commands, and it also covers Moscow and St. Petersburg, various important industrial areas, and the heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave . As well as the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS, units in the western region, the WMD is responsible for Russian Ground Troops within the region, as well as the entire Baltic Fleet , which also includes its own aircraft units. In the case of a full-scale war, the WMD would also assume control of relevant Russian Federal National Guard Service (Rosgvardia) units, the border guard troops of the Federal Security Service (FSB), and the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS). With responsibility for the defense of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the WMD has the most capable ground-based air-defense coverage in Russia, with protective zones around these cities as well as Kaliningrad. These air defense systems can counter both aircraft and cruise missiles as well as tactical and even — in the case of the Russian capital region — to a limited degree strategic ballistic missiles . WMD Fixed-Wing Aviation When it comes to the VKS units subordinated to the WMD, these come under the command of the 6th Air Force and Air Defense Army, or 6 A VVS PVO, an organization that only came into being in 2015. The 6 A VVS PVO includes strategically tasked ground-based air defense units, as well as tactical combat aircraft (known in Russia collectively as Frontal Aviation), and Army Aviation helicopters, which are expected to operate in close concert with Russian Ground Troops. A much-simplified map of the Western Military District. , Swedish Defense Research Agency Within the 6 A VVS PVO is a single composite division, the 105th Composite Aviation Division (105 SAD), which includes all the WMD’s fighters and strike aircraft, plus an independent composite transport regiment, which mainly conducts VIP and liaison missions. The Army Aviation component has one brigade and two regiments for a total of 10 helicopter squadrons, including units equipped with types capable of performing attack, air assault, and transport tasks. Major airbases within the Western Military District, excluding the Baltic Fleet., GOOGLE MAPS The following airbases are employed permanently by the WMD, and at least some of them would be expected to play a role in any large-scale military operations involving this military district. While some of these facilities are farther away from the Ukrainian border, they could still send aircraft to contribute, or could forward-deploy their assets: Kursk-Khalino: The 105 SAD’s 14th Fighter Aviation Regiment (14 IAP) has two fighter squadrons, both flying the two-seat Su-30SM. The regiment has a nominal strength of 24 Su-30SMs, which replaced around 30 MiG-29SMT/UB Fulcrum fighter jets that had been incorporated into the VKS after their rejection by export customer Algeria. The status of the Fulcrums is a little unclear: They appear to have become non-operational after delivery of the Su-30SMs, but then appeared again earlier this year in Syria, as part of a combat deployment. MiG-29SMT jets from Kursk-Khalino take part in a Victory Parade flight to St. Petersburg-Levashovo in 2017: Voronezh: The tactical bomber capabilities of the 105 SAD rest with the 47 BAP, which has two squadrons of Su-34 Fullbacks — frontal bombers in Russian terminology — at Voronezh. The regiment received 24 Su-34s to replace its previous Su-24M fleet, and the Fullbacks were among the first to deploy to Syria for combat operations. Unusual among VKS units, the 47 BAP has extensive combat experience in the delivery of precision air-to-ground munitions, including laser and TV-guided bombs and missiles and satellite-guided bombs employed in Syria.

The regiment operates 24 Su-35S jets which replaced previous-generation Su-27Ps and modestly upgraded Su-27SMs. As such the Besovets unit is reflective of the wider re-equipment program that has invested the WMD with new fighters featuring more modern capabilities, including multi-role capability, precision-guided munitions, and improved avionics and navigation/attack systems. Ground crew prepare air-to-air missiles during the Ladoga-2019 exercise at Besovets airbase., Russian Ministry of Defense Khotilovo: Another 105 SAD regiment, the 790 IAP has three fighter squadrons flying a mix of Su-35S jets and MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors. This was the second WMD regiment to get the Su-35S, after the unit at Besovets, again replacing a previous fleet of Su-27P/SM/UB jets. Alongside the 12 Su-35S assigned to one squadron, the other two 790 IAP squadrons between them operate a total of 24 upgraded MiG-31BM/BSM interceptors. These provide the WMD with a significant long-range air-defense capability, including the ability to engage low-flying cruise missiles , a capability that Ukraine does not currently possess. A missile-armed Su-35S of the 790th Fighter Aviation Regiment at Khotilovo., Russian Ministry of Defense Shatalovo: One of two direct-reporting units, the 4 ORAE is a dedicated reconnaissance squadron flying six to eight Su-24MR Fencer fast jets, as well as a smaller number of An-30 twin turboprops used for photo-survey. The fact that only a single squadron is responsible for all tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the WMD is perhaps surprising, but assets would likely be deployed to the region from elsewhere in Russia during an actual conflict. St. Petersburg-Levashovo: Another direct-reporting unit, the 33 OTSAP is an independent composite aviation regiment with two composite transport squadrons at these two bases, Levashovo outside of St. Petersburg and Semyazino east of Moscow. These operate a diverse array of An-26, An-12, An-72, Tu-134, An-148, L-410, Mi-8, and Mi-26 aircraft. WMD Army Aviation Ostrov: Part of the WMD’s Army Aviation branch, the 15th Army Aviation Brigade (15 Br AA) at Ostrov has two attack helicopter squadrons with Ka-52 Hokum and Mi-28N/UB Havoc rotorcraft, two assault transport squadrons with Mi-8MTV-5-1 Hips, as well as a detachment of Mi-26 Halo heavy transport helicopters that together provide a significant aerial assault capability. A Mi-28N from the 15th Army Aviation Brigade based at Ostrov., Alan Wilson/Wikimedia Commons Vyazma: This base is home to Army Aviation’s 440 OVP, the second of two independent helicopter regiments. It consists of two attack (Ka-52 and Mi-24P) squadrons and one assault transport squadron (Mi-8MTV-5-1), as well as an electronic warfare (EW) detachment, the latter equipped with the Mi-8MTPR-1 . While there are few airborne EW assets directly attached to the WMD, extensive electronic warfare operations have been a feature of recent Russian campaigns in the Middle East and would be expected to feature heavily in a new offensive in Ukraine. Pushkin and Pribylovo: These two bases together support the 549 OVP, one of the WMD’s two independent helicopter regiments. This Army Aviation formation consists of one attack, one assault transport, and one composite (equipped with a mixture of attack and assault transport helicopters) squadron. Between them, these fly the Mi-24P and Mi-35M Hind, Mi-28N/UB, and Mi-8MTV-2/MTV-5-1. A Mi-24P of the 549th Independent Helicopter Regiment., Igor Dvurekov/Wikimedia Commons It’s notable how few tactical strike assets are permanently assigned to the WMD. The spearhead is the 47 BAP, with its Su-34s based at Voronezh. Were offensive operations to be launched over Ukraine, it’s likely that these would be supplemented by additional Su-24 and Su-34 units deployed from other bases in Russia. At the same time, the shift to the multirole Su-35S and Su-30SM means that these fighters are increasingly able to fly air-to-ground missions, too. One Frontal Aviation aircraft type that is ‘missing’ from the WMD is the Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft, which was widely used in Syria. In the past, plans were announced to establish an attack regiment with Su-25s at Buturlinovka, but this has never taken place. Again, however, Su-25s from elsewhere in Russia would likely be deployed to the WMD to support potential operations over Ukraine. In its favor, the 6 A VVS PVO includes some of the best trained VKS units, with regular live-fire exercises in the region, including the large-scale Zapad-21 maneuvers that took place earlier this year and involved around 80 aircraft and helicopters. In addition, Russia’s long-running campaign in Syria has exposed a significant proportion of airmen — reportedly over 90 percent — to combat operations, with some of the most experienced pilots having accumulated more than 400 combat sorties, according to Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu. However, it should be noted that the majority of experience in air-to-ground scenarios — whether during training or in the Syrian campaign —has been gained in the employment of unguided bombs and rockets, as well as cannon fire, with only limited use of guided air-to-surface missiles or bombs. A significant capability within the 6 A VVS PVO is the ready availability of Army Aviation units, which would be critical to supporting any kind of ground campaign. Overall, the Army Aviation branch within the WMD has been expanded significantly in recent years. In late 2013, for example, there were four or five frontline squadrons, while that number has since increased to 10, which are responsible for a fleet of between 180 and 200 helicopters. Within the WMD specifically, these units deliver a significant punch, with no fewer than five attack helicopter squadrons, another four squadrons with armed assault transport rotorcraft, and a composite squadron that operates a mixed fleet of attack and assault transport helicopters. The equipment they operate is notably advanced, including Ka-52, Mi-28N/UB, and Mi-35M attack helicopters which offer night and adverse-weather capabilities and feature anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) armament. A tactical flying exercise in the Western Military District involving Mi-8, Mi-24, and Ka-52 helicopters from Vyazma airbase: For troop transport, the WMD has immediate access to around 80 examples of the Mi-8MTV-5-1, among the most modern versions of the venerable Hip helicopter. In terms of fixed-wing transports, the WMD has only limited capabilities within its ranks, with a handful of obsolescent An-26 and An-12BK transports available for general cargo and troop transport. However, more transport capacity can be drawn from the various units of Transport Aviation , a separate branch of the VKS, with its bases all located further east. The same applies to aerial refueling assets, with no tankers being assigned to the WMD. Instead, any aerial refueling capacity would have to be provided by Long-Range Aviation, which also trains regularly with Frontal Aviation assets. Southern Military District In addition to the WMD facing Ukraine in the west, certain aviation units of the Southern Military District (SMD) also potentially play into the Ukraine equation. The air assets within this command fall under the command of the 4th Air Force and Air Defense Army, or 4 A VVS PVO. SMD Fixed-Wing Aviation It was units from the 4 A VVS PVO that bore the brunt of the fighting in Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, later took part in the war with Georgia in 2008, and — most important for this analysis — were involved in the seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. For this reason, elements of the 4 A VVS PVO remain at high readiness in case the conflict with Ukraine escalates. In comparison to the WMD, the strike components of the SMD are somewhat stronger, with two regiments of Su-24/Su-34 tactical bombers, two regiments of Su-25 attack aircraft, plus a brigade and two regiments of Army Aviation helicopters. At the same time, MiG-31 interceptor units are absent. Major airbases within the Southern Military District, including in Crimea., GOOGLE MAPS Since the annexation of Crimea, a new composite division has been established on this territory, with three aviation regiments. This is the 27th Composite Aviation Division (27 SAD), with its headquarters in Belbek, Crimea. The 27 SAD consists of flying units at the following bases: Gvardeyskoye: Home to the 37th Composite Aviation Regiment (37 SAP), this consists of two squadrons: a bomber unit with Su-24Ms, and an attack unit with upgraded Su-25SM aircraft. Belbek: The 38th Fighter Aviation Regiment (38 IAP) at this base has two fighter squadrons. The first of these is equipped with Su-27SM fighters, while the second operates Su-27SM3 and Su-30M2 fighters. Dzhankoy: The rotary-wing regiment in Crimea is the 39th Helicopter Regiment (39 VP), which received one squadron with Ka-52s, a second with Mi-28N and Mi-35M helicopters, and a third with the Mi-8AMTSh. In addition to these, further strike capabilities are provided by the Russian Navy, which has the 43rd Independent Naval Attack Aviation Regiment (43 OMShAP) stationed at Saki in Crimea. This regiment flies 12 Su-30SMs, six Su-24Ms, and six Su-24MRs, and came to prominence during several encounters with NATO forces in the Black Sea earlier this year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=3oFDwJZltCs While the SMD units can be immediately brought to bear in a potential conflict in Ukraine, due to their locations in Crimea, the SMD has other aviation units that it can call upon too, also under the command of the 4 A VVS PVO. Some of these are based outside Russian borders, in Armenia, but those in Russia are as follows: Krymsk: Part of the 1st Composite Aviation Division (1 SAD), the 3rd Composite Aviation Regiment (3 SAP) at Krymsk operates two squadrons of Su-27SM(3) fighters and a handful of Su-30M2 trainers, one squadron of non-upgraded Su-27s, plus a detachment of Ka-27 helicopters. One of the older, non-upgraded Su-27s operated by the 3 SAP based at Krymsk., Alan Wilson/Wikimedia Commons Millerovo: Also under the 1 SAD is the 31 IAP at Millerovo. Formerly a MiG-29 operator, it has upgraded to the Su-30SM, with a total of 24 aircraft divided between two squadrons. Located less than 20 miles from the Ukrainian border, this base was involved in the fighting in Donbas in 2014. Budyonnovsk: The 368th Attack Aviation Regiment (368 ShAP) under the 1 SAD is a long-term operator of the Su-25, flying the type in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After transferring one Frogfoot squadron to Gvardeyskoye in Crimea it now has two squadrons with upgraded Su-25SM and Su-25SM3 aircraft. Morozovsk: Last of the 1 SAD regiments is the 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment (559 BAP) which has three squadrons with a total of 36 Su-34 aircraft, making it one of the most powerful tactical bomber units within the entire VKS. The unit is another which has considerable experience in the Syrian campaign. Su-34s from the 559 BAP at Morozovsk take part in an exercise., Russian Ministry of Defense Marinovka: Marinovka near Volgograd is home to the 11th Composite Aviation Regiment (11 SAP) flying the Su-24M and Su-24MR. Primorsko-Akhtarsk: Another Su-25 unit is at Primorsko-Akhtarsk, the 960th Attack Aviation Regiment (960 ShAP) having fought in Chechnya and in Georgia. Rostov-on-Don: The transport aviation assets of the SMD are found within the 30th Independent Transport Composite Aviation Regiment (30 OTSAP) at Rostov-on-Don. It has a mixed fleet of fixed-wing types (An-12 and An-26 aircraft, plus smaller numbers of An-148, Il-22, L-410, and Tu-134), as well as a helicopter squadron with a dozen Mi-8 and Mi-26 helicopters. SMD Army Aviation The Army Aviation units within the SMD follow a very similar pattern to their counterparts in the WMD. There is a single brigade, the 16th Army Aviation Brigade (16 Br AA), at Zernograd with two squadrons of Mi-8 transport helicopters, two squadrons of Mi-28N and Mi-35M attack helicopters, and a detachment of Mi-26 heavy transport helicopters. Then there are also two independent Army Aviation regiments. These are the 55th Independent Helicopter Regiment (55 OVP) at Korenovsk with a squadron of Mi-8AMTSh transport helicopters, a squadron of Mi-28N and Mi-35M attack helicopters, and a squadron of Ka-52 attack helicopters, and the 487 OVP at Budyonnovsk that has a transport squadron with Mi-8AMTSh and Mi-8MTV-5 helicopters and two combat squadrons with Mi-24s, Mi-28Ns, and Mi-35Ms. Army Aviation helicopters proved an important component in the earlier seizure of Crimea. Ukrainian military aviation assets Against the might of the WMD and SMD, not to mention other Russian-based VKS units that are available to support them, Ukraine’s airpower might seem entirely mismatched. While Western sources credit the Ukrainian Air Force, or PS, as being Europe’s seventh-largest air force, this still amounts to approximately 200 aircraft of all types — compared to around 1,500 combat aircraft for Russia’s air arms . Furthermore, the majority of the PS fleet is made up of Soviet-era aircraft. While local upgrade programs have been launched to address obsolescence issues, they have had mixed results. On the other hand, there are extensive stocks of spares and aircraft that can be returned to service as well as experienced local overhaul and maintenance facilities and Ukraine has made efforts to bolster its capabilities since the fighting began in 2014. Major airbases within Ukraine., GOOGLE MAPS Around 50 MiG-29 fighters survive with the PS, and these are assigned to two regiments, the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade (40 brTA) at Vasyl’kiv and the 114 brTA at Ivano/Frankivs’k. Approximately 32 Su-27s survive with another two regiments, at the 831 brTA at Myrhorod and the 39 brTA at Ozerne. A Ukrainian Air Force Su-27 fitted with inert air-to-air missiles., Oleg V. Belyakov/Wikimedia Commons A single Ukrainian base, Starokostiantyniv, operates a dwindling number of Su-24Ms and Su-24MRs, perhaps a dozen in all, assigned to the 7 brTA. That same base is now also operating the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed unmanned aerial vehicles, which have seen recent combat in the east of the country. Ukrainian Air Force Su-24MR tactical reconnaissance jet., Eugene Dmitriyenko/Wikimedia Commons In common with Russia’s SMD, the PS also still operates the Su-25, with the 299 brTA at Kul’bakino airbase near Mykolayiv. Surviving aircraft have been upgraded with new navigation equipment, while chaff/flare launchers were added in the wake of the hostilities in Donbas, during which Su-25s were temporarily detached to Dnipropetrovsk International Airport. Five Su-25s were lost during the fighting in 2014, but they were replaced by returning to service aircraft from storage. Transport assets of the PS are concentrated with the 25th Transport Aviation Brigade (25 TrAB) at Melitopol, which includes examples of the An-26 as well as around seven Il-76MD Candid airlifters, which provide a significant airlift capability, including the ability to deliver paratroopers and airdropped cargoes. Ukrainian soldiers prepare a BMD-1 infantry fighting vehicle for transport in the hold of an Il-76 airlifter., Olegvdv68/Wikimedia Commons Unlike its Russian counterpart, Ukrainian Army Aviation is a separate branch and not part of the air force. It relies almost exclusively on older versions of the Mi-8 and Mi-24, with around 50 Hips and 30 or more Mi-24s currently active. A Ukrainian Army Aviation Mi-8MTV-2., Eugene Dmitriyenko/Wikimedia Commons The Ukrainian Navy has for long provided little more than a token force, based at Kul’bakino and heavily optimized for coastal maritime work. Earlier this year, however, the service also began to receive Bayraktar TB2 drones. Airpower against the odds? On paper, Ukraine’s available airpower is hardly a match for just one Russian military district, let alone the VKS at large. However, Ukraine has gained valuable combat experience from the conflict in the east of the country. Ukrainian pilots are aware of the threat posed by man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) and other air-defense systems that have been fielded by pro-Russian forces during that campaign. But back in 2014, the threat posed by short-range air-defense systems effectively grounded the PS and Ukrainian Army Aviation, and Kyiv has been reluctant to deploy significant air assets in the eastern Donbas region since then. At the same time, the extent of the Russian ground-based air-defense ‘umbrella’ is such that, with the forward deployment of additional assets — something that is routinely practiced — it could reach far into Ukrainian territory even from the Russian side of the border, creating a ‘sanitized’ zone in which opposing air operations were made almost impossible. All this would be further enabled by the availability of A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft, providing a lookdown capability from on high and filling in any gaps in ground-based radar coverage caused by terrain. A Russian S-300V long-range surface-to-air missile system from the Western Military District during a live-fire exercise in the Astrakhan region earlier this year. , Russian Ministry of Defense As part of this strategy, Ukrainian airbases and any stationary radars or command posts would also be prime targets for standoff strikes using air and ground-launched missiles , which include ballistic Iskander-M types , as well as Kalibr cruise missiles launched by the Black Sea Fleet , further hampering Ukrainian counter-air operations. Russia’s Long-Range Aviation, which is increasingly adding conventional weapons to its arsenal, could launch additional cruise missile strikes. Overall, Russia’s standoff cruise missile capabilities and overall capacity have evolved a lot in the last decade or so and would allow Moscow to limit the risk to manned assets when striking fixed targets farther west. First flight of the latest upgraded Tu-95MSM strategic bomber/missile carrier: With that in mind, Ukraine may well respond to a large-scale Russian intervention on its territory by instead keeping its limited manned aircraft out of harm’s way as much as possible, even repositioning them in the western reaches of the country, and instead employing its ground-based air defenses. These defenses are similarly made up of mainly Soviet-era legacy systems, which are extremely well known to Russia’s air forces, including Buks and older versions of the long-range S-300 . But there are also MANPADS, including upgraded Igla and Strela types , which could pose a threat to low-flying aircraft, as could the more recently delivered U.S.-made Javelin missiles which have an anti-helicopter capability. Russia has also made major advances in the self-protection suites of its helicopters that could offset some of their effectiveness. The weight of Russian numbers would almost certainly prevail, and Ukraine’s lack of strategic depth means its aircraft would still be vulnerable to missile strikes even when dispersed on the ground. However, the Ukrainian air defenses have the ability to at least slow down a Russian advance and, in the process, tie up the VKS in defense-suppression missions. There is also the possibility that Ukraine may receive more modern air-defense systems , too — although even if approved, they may not arrive in time, based on the more pessimistic timeline predictions. A Ukrainian Buk air defense missile system is transported northwest of Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine, during the fighting in Donbas in 2014. , AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky Ultimately, Ukraine possesses a relatively tiny military force staring down a much larger one, and it has very little real means of counter-striking against Russian airpower facilities near the border. For Moscow, air superiority is likely assured, and Russia has shown that it is willing to accept combat losses during its campaign in Syria . Aside from the various manned air assets discussed here, Russia would likely make extensive use of lower-end drones for artillery spotting and for directing airstrikes, and loitering munitions are also now being employed, including in combat trials in Syria . Whatever course a Russian intervention in Ukraine might take, there is little chance that it would not involve significant participation by the air assets of the WMD, SMD, and the wider VKS. Despite the gulf between the Russian and Ukrainian airpower in terms of numbers and modernity, Moscow’s defense planners will be well aware that a confrontation with the Ukrainian military would involve no shortage of hazards and that the control of the air will likely be crucial to developments on the ground. Were there to be a new and large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv could perhaps try to impose enough attrition in the air over a long enough period for Moscow to rethink its actions. But the odds in the sky are very clearly weighted against Ukraine. As such, another strategy could be for Ukraine to forfeit air sovereignty over the war-torn eastern part of Ukraine and fortify everything to the west, especially around Kyiv, in preparation for what could be a long and arduous conflict.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 21, 2021",Congress Has Already Allocated Tens Of Millions For USS Connecticut Repairs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first clues as to how much it might cost to repair the U.S. Navy’s damaged Seawolf class nuclear attack submarine USS Connecticut can be found tucked away in the latest version of the annual defense policy bill for the 2022 Fiscal Year. The legislation approves $10 million to help pay for a new bow sonar dome and another $40 million for other “emergent repairs.” Craig Hooper, writing for Forbes , was first to notice these details about funding for Connecticut’s repairs. The Senate passed this bill , formally known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022, earlier this month, and it is now waiting on President Joe Biden to either sign it into law or veto it. Both houses of Congress had been picking over this piece of legislation for months, more than enough time to add in money for fixing Connecticut, which lost its sonar dome and sustained other damage as a result of a collision with an underwater seamount in the South China Sea in October. The line item from the NDAA covering the new Seawolf class bow dome, with the approved funding shown in thousands of dollars., US Congress The line item for the other “emergent repairs,” again with the total amount in thousands of dollars., US Congress After the accident, the submarine had limped to Guam, where it spent some two months undergoing initial evaluations of the damage, the full extent of which remains unknown, as well as interim repairs and unspecified testing. The boat finally arrived in Washington State this weekend after an arduous journey across the Pacific Ocean from Guam by way of San Diego in Southern California. Connecticut reportedly could not safely dive after the mishap and this, combined with impacts to its handling and performance from the missing sonar dome and other damage, likely made this a nightmarish voyage for those on board, as The War Zone has previously explained . No further context about the repairs that Connecticut now needs is found in the NDAA, nor is there any indication one way or another about whether this is the only funding that is expected to be required to get the boat back to the fleet. One would think that the sonar dome for such a specialized submarine as this alone would cost much more than $10 million. Overall, it seems extremely likely that this is just an initial portion of the total cost it will take to return this submarine to service. For comparison, in 2006, the Navy estimated that it would take $79 million , almost $109 million in today’s dollars, to fully repair the Los Angeles class attack submarine USS San Francisco , which had sustained extensive damage to its bow after its own underwater collision with a seamount the year before. The service’s repair plan, in that case, involved grafting the entire front end of a different Los Angeles class submarine, the USS Honolulu , onto San Francisco . It ultimately took three years and $134 million , or close to $173 million when adjusted for inflation, just to get that submarine back in the water. Pictures showing the damage to USS San Francisco following its collision in 2005., Public Domain/Wikimedia The Navy decided on this course of action because San Francisco had recently had its nuclear reactor refueled and Honolulu was due to undergo a similar overhaul, which is a costly and complex process. The service estimated it would have cost $170 million in 2006 dollars, or around $234 million in today’s dollars, to refuel Honolulu. Whatever the extent of the damage to Connecticut might be, a similar ‘ nose job ‘ isn’t a viable option in this case. Only three of the advanced and secretive Seawolf class submarines were ever built and they are in high demand for a variety of specialized tasks. The third boat in the class, the USS Jimmy Carter , is, in fact, the lone example of a distinct subclass, featuring a 100-foot long Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) hull extension, which you can read more about here . While intelligence-gathering is understood to be a key mission for all of these submarines, Jimmy Carter ‘s MMP and other reported modifications give it the ability to conduct more extensive underwater espionage missions, including inspecting, recovering, and otherwise manipulating objects of interest on the seafloor. In addition, the small size of the Seawolf fleet, together with the fact this design dates back to the 1980s and has long been out of production, meaning that institutional knowledge about its particulars has likely atrophied within the Navy and its manufacturer, General Dynamics Electric Boat, are all likely to impact the size of the final repair bill. USS Seawolf and her sister ships remain the most expensive attack submarines ever designed, with the standard boats having an estimated unit cost of $3.1 billion in 1983, or over $8.5 billion today, and Jimmy Carter costing even more. The USS Seawolf under construction in the late 1990s., Public Domain/Wikimedia All of this underscores that it is possible, if not extremely plausible that $50 million will just be the downpayment toward getting Connecticut fully repaired. How much it will cost in the end, and how long it will take to actually fix the submarine, remain to be seen. At the same time, the Navy is not even expecting to order its first next-generation SSN(X) nuclear attack submarine, which it wants to be at least a spiritual successor to the Seawolf class, until the 2031 Fiscal Year . Beyond that, the Navy’s submarine fleets, as a whole, are already struggling to meet operational demands , which are only likely to grow amid a growing emphasis on preparedness for a future major conflict against a near-peer adversary, such as China or Russia. Chinese and Russian undersea threats have themselves prompted a renewed interest in anti-submarine warfare capabilities within the Navy. So, there is every indication that the service is committed in the meantime to spending whatever it takes to ensure it can regain the distinct capabilities that Connecticut offers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 30, 2021",Third Test Of The Air Force’s Hypersonic Weapon Has Failed Like The Ones Before It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has failed for a third time to conduct a successful test of the rocket booster on a prototype AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon hypersonic missile, or ARRW. This can only add to the palatable frustration within the service, as well as elsewhere in the U.S. military and in Congress, about the progress, or lack thereof, in the testing of various new hypersonic weapons. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Armament Directorate confirmed to The War Zone today that another attempted ARRW flight test had failed on Dec. 15, 2021. The Air Force says that it has not yet determined the cause of the issue that led to the test being aborted. The prototype missile never left the wing of the B-52H bomber carrying it. An AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon test article under the wing of a B-52H bomber during an earlier test., U.S. Air Force “On 15 Dec. 2021, the Department of the Air Force attempted a booster test flight of the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) from a B-52 Stratofortress,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Heath Collins, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Weapons, told The War Zone in a statement. “The launch sequence was aborted before release with an unknown issue. The missile will return to the factory and analysis of the telemetry and onboard data will begin immediately. The program will seek to resume flight test as quickly as possible.” This comes some five months after the second attempt to conduct this flight test of the ARRW’s rocket booster. The Air Force deemed that test in July to have been a partial success, even though the rocket did not ignite as intended, because the prototype weapon separated safely from the B-52H bomber that it had been loaded onto and provided an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the launch procedure. The Air Force’s first attempt had come in April. In that case, as in this latest test, an unspecified issue forced the mission to be scrapped and the weapon remained on the wing of the B-52H the entire time. The primary goal of this particular test has been to demonstrate the rocket booster’s ability to perform as intended. The Air Force had hoped to conduct three successful booster tests this year ahead of the start of testing of prototypes with actual hypersonic boost-glide vehicles loaded inside them. As designed , ARRW uses the rocket to boost the entire weapon to a designated speed and altitude, after which the nose cone breaks apart and an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle is released. That vehicle then glides back down toward its target at hypersonic speed, defined as anything above Mach 5, while following a shallow, atmospheric flight path. It will also have a high degree of maneuverability, allowing it to make erratic course changes that, together with how fast it is moving, make it extremely difficult for opponents to spot, track, or otherwise react to, let alone defend against. An artist’s conception of an AGM-183A right before releasing its hypersonic boost-glide vehicle payload., Lockheed Martin The first indication that another ARRW test attempt might have been imminent on Dec. 15 had come when one of NASA’s WB-57F test aircraft was spotted on online flight tracking software flying off the coast of Southern California in the same general area as the previous two attempted launches. WB-57Fs have taken part in previous flight testing of the AGM-183A, as well. This particular WB-57F, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N926NA left Southern California on Dec. 16, further indicating that whatever mission it had been tasked with was complete. A third failure in a row for the ARRW program is undoubtedly troubling, even if some hiccups are to be expected in the development of any new advanced weapon system. “I’m not satisfied with the pace,” Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall had said about the testing of new hypersonic weapons, in general, at the Air Force Association’s annual Air Force Association Air, Space & Cyber conference in September. “We’re making some progress on the technology; I would like to see it be better.” Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall., USAF Problems encountered in the testing of new hypersonic systems extend beyond the Air Force, too. In October, the Pentagon announced the failure of a test of a still unspecified hypersonic missile from the Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska on Kodiak Island. The U.S. Army and Navy are also set to begin tests next year of a jointly developed hypersonic missile that employs a different style of boost-glide vehicle from the one inside ARRW. The Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. military, have repeatedly touted new hypersonic weapons as key to future warfighting plans, especially in potential high-end conflicts against near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia. At the same time, Secretary Kendall had also said in September that he was “not satisfied with the degree to which we have figured out what we need for hypersonics — of what type, for what missions.” All of this also comes as China and Russia have begun to field their own hypersonic weapons and are continuing to develop additional types. China, in particular, has rocked national security circles with its reported testing of some kind of Fractional Orbital Bombard System that employs a hypersonic glide vehicle, which you can read more about here . North Korea also claimed earlier this year to have tested a ballistic missile tipped with a boost-glide vehicle. “What you need to be worried about is that in the last five years, or maybe longer, the United States has done nine hypersonic missile tests, and in the same time the Chinese have done hundreds,” now-retired Air Force Gen. John Hyten, who was Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Defense Writers Group event in October. “Single digits vs hundreds is not a good place.” Then-Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten takes part in a virtual leadership event in March 2021., DOD Hyten reiterated those same points in an interview with CBS News that aired in November. The Air Force, as well as prime contractor Lockheed Martin, is clearly hoping to get on to the next test of ARRW as soon as possible. Lockheed Martin notably held an October ceremony in Alabama to open a new factory in which these missiles will be made. In the past, the Air Force had stated its goal was to reach an early operational capability with this weapon, leveraging unused prototype missiles , by September 2022. So far, however, ARRW’s progress in testing has been, at best, disappointing. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 8, 2022",The F-117 Tested A Mirror-Like Skin Decades Before The F-22 Did,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since our initial reporting, Nellis Air Force Base’s ‘mirrored’ F-22 has grabbed a ton of attention. The aircraft has been flying regular sorties, and some great additional photos and videos have emerged of it in action. That being said, we want to add a bit of important historical connective tissue to our original story, which has to do with the F-117 Nighthawk. We also have a statement from the Air Force on the Raptor’s mysterious metallic coating to share. The same mirrored F-22 is seen from different angles. The reflectivity totally changes depending on the viewing aspect., Anthony Vogel We wrote the following about the SENIOR SPUD program earlier this year, in a story to mark the 40th anniversary of the F-117’s first flight, in which we laid out all the unique paint schemes and treatments the F-117 had worn over the years: Another oddity around the same time was the half-black, half-metallic 79-10784, another one of the FSD [full-scale development] jets, which was trialed under the SENIOR SPUD program in July 1993. Over the course of four test flights, these metallic areas were apparently used to evaluate ways of reducing infrared signature, Paul F. Crickmore records, with the jet flying together with the NKC-135A Flying Infrared Signature Technology Aircraft (FISTA). It’s not clear how successful that was, but, in terms of visual signature, the metallic panels made the jet highly conspicuous in the daytime, at least. Similar testing continues to this very day, including using other surrogate aircraft. The surrogate aircraft we mentioned was one of Scaled Composites’ shadowy ‘Son of Ares’ Model 401 aircraft, which was caught flying over Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake covered in a very similar coating as what we have seen on the F-22 recently. You can read all about that revelation here. When it comes to the SENIOR SPUD program, the only image of this metallic treatment on the F-117 we knew about was included in the original article, as well as below: In its half-metallic scheme, the coated F-117 is refueled by a KC-135., Public Domain It turns out that there is another image, seen at the top of this story, that really helps shed light on the nature of the material applied to the F-117 under the SENIOR SPUD program. The metallic coating looks extremely similar to what the F-22 in question is wearing today. That image was posted by aviation author Peter Merlin in the Dreamlandresort.com forums , along with the statement: “It looks similar to the SENIOR SPUD test project. In July 1993 an F-117A was partially coated with a reflective material in an attempt to reduce the aircraft’s infrared (IR) signature. Flight testing took place with the F-117A performing various maneuvers in the vicinity of Edwards AFB including low passes over the main runway. IR measurements were taken by sensors onboard the NKC-135A Flying Infrared Signatures Technology Aircraft (FISTA). Photos of the aircraft show what looks like some sort of diffraction grating (what we used to call “spectrum tape” or “rainbow tape” back in the 1970s). I have seen video footage of the flight tests. The coating may have reduced the IR signature, but it increased the visual signature like you wouldn’t believe. When the sun struck the coated surface, it lit up like crazy.” Just like on the F-22, the coating on the F-117 is made up of a mosaic of metallic tiles and sheets, which allows it to be applied to conform to critical areas, such as the wings, and to be arrayed around moving parts and apertures. But most importantly, it is something akin to a chameleon nature, in that it looks mirror-like when viewed from some angles and matte-like and unreflective when viewed from others. SENIOR SPUD also had a direct relation to the F-22 program. The coating seen in a strip on the F-117’s right wing was developed for the F-22 and tested aboard the F-117 under the SENIOR SPUD initiative. It’s also worth mentioning that F-117s may have donned a similar skin more recently. Images of an F-117 flying with a bizarre metallic leading edge emerged in 2019 (seen in the tweet below). As we have noted for years, F-117s still serve in a research and development role for testing low-observable treatments and new sensor systems , as well as providing low-observable adversary air support . The idea that the F-22 program could be looking at a similar concept 30 years later isn’t too surprising. Even if this material has an adverse effect on the F-22’s radar cross-section, but greatly reduces its infrared signature, the trade may become well worth it in an age of rapidly advancing infrared search and track (IRST) systems, including those mounted on advanced drones . IRSTs, which are totally passive sensors that scan for aerial targets in the infrared spectrum, are fully immune to the F-22’s radar-evading qualities. View this post on Instagram A post shared by santos caceres (@santos_caceres.lv) View this post on Instagram A post shared by santos caceres (@santos_caceres.lv) View this post on Instagram A post shared by santos caceres (@santos_caceres.lv) Clearly, the technology has evolved in the years since SENIOR SPUD tested its reflective material. We have received various degrees of speculation regarding exactly what this material may do and how it works, including folks thinking it carries an electric current to help mask the jet’s skin temperature. Others have said the coating’s unique properties — high reflectivity and low emissivity — helps decrease radiant energy, making it basically a stealth coating designed for the infrared, not radio-frequency spectrum. Ever more capable IRSTs are being fielded on foreign fighter aircraft, and for the first time in decades, domestic fighters as well. Here we see a line of Chinese J-10s equipped with IRSTs mounted on their upper nose areas., PLAAF As for the Air Force, the 57th Wing was kind enough to get back to us on our inquiry about the ‘mirrored Raptor,’ their response was quite cryptic, but at least we got one: The F-22 is part of a material demonstration that will evaluate material suitability to improve aircraft sustainment. New materials may reduce the lifecycle management burden associated with maintaining the aircraft, and increasing the useable lifetime of aircraft is essential to optimize government resources. Increasing the useable lifetime of the aircraft clearly makes sense, as new low-observable treatments could enhance its survivability under evolving threat circumstances. As for the rest, it isn’t clear how hundreds of individual metallic tiles, sheets, and strips would help with sustainment, but it is possible this is a new coating that does help in those regards, at least partially. The F-22’s radar-absorbent coatings are notoriously maintenance-intensive . As noted earlier, trading some low observability in the RF spectrum for enhanced low observability in the IR spectrum, while also realizing a more reliable F-22 fleet, may be a worthy tradeoff. And we still don’t know if the metallic cladding does reduce the F-22’s stealthiness when it comes to radar detection at all. Maybe advances in material science have allowed for the best of both worlds in that regard. On the other hand, the 57th Wing’s reply could be a boilerplate response for new coatings on the F-22 in general. We are also marching towards an age where directed energy warfare, primarily in the form of lasers , will pose an increasing risk to combat aircraft, especially in the air-to-air combat domain . It isn’t clear if this material may favorably impact the survivability of an aircraft when faced with such a threat. Even relatively conservative reductions in the range at which such an aircraft is vulnerable to laser attacks of a certain power and beam quality could be a serious advantage in the decades to come. So, the mirrored Raptor still remains something of a mystery, but it would seem that it is related, at least in some regard, to SENIOR SPUD and the F-117 program that served as a progenitor to the F-22 decades ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",The Air Force’s 60-Year-Old B-52 Bombers Are Getting Their First USB Ports,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two U.S. Air Force reservists have developed a combination LED map light and USB port that they hope to install in the cockpits of B-52H bombers . The service is now curious to know whether what might seem like a simple gadget can reduce the risk of crews losing access to critical information during long-duration missions and provide an added margin of safety. Engineers from the B-52H Stratofortress Systems Program Office (SPO) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio recently traveled to Barksdale Air Force Base in Lousiana to discuss potential ways to integrate the light and USB port into the 1950s-era bomber’s dated cockpit architecture. Lt. Col. Warren Carroll and Maj. Brandon Wolf, both assigned to the 307th Bomb Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit at Barksdale that is aligned with the active-duty 2nd Bomb Wing, were the ones who first proposed this idea. A B-52H assigned to the 2nd Bomb Wing’s 96th Bomb Squadron prepares to refuel over the Rocky Mountains. USAF In June, Carroll and Wolf received $15,000 in squadron innovation funds to build an initial batch of prototypes after making their pitch at the 2021 Strike Tank Innovation Rodeo at Barksdale put on by the 2nd Bomb Wing’s Innovation Group. The two officers represented LR WERX, which is an AFWERX “spark cell” at Barksdale, at that competition. AFWERX is an internal Air Force technology incubator designed to help foster innovation and fund the rapid prototyping of solutions to various problems . The two reservists say that each light/USB combo costs approximately $2,800 to make. The idea, as it stands now, is that a single B-52H would have three of these units installed in its cockpit. The Air Force has previously said that two sets of prototypes would be added to an unspecified number of bombers assigned to the 2nd and 307th Bomb Wings as part of an initial proof of concept. If each system costs just under $3,000 to make, this should mean there is funding to build five more examples in addition to the one Carroll and Wolf brought to the competition earlier this year. This, in turn, would indicate that they will produce enough of these systems to outfit two bombers to start. The prototype LED map light and USB combo. USAF The prototype light and USB combo, at bottom, compared to the existing map light used in B-52 cockpits. USAF The basic reason behind putting these lights and USB ports in the B-52H’s cockpit is simple. “We carry electronic tablets on our missions and constantly reference them for checklists, technical orders, landing data, and other performance information needed to make in-flight calculations,” Carroll explained in a statement. “But the batteries on the tablets only last a few hours.” The B-52H is one of America’s current trio of long-range strategic bombers and these aircraft routinely fly long-duration missions in support of combat operations and other training and test activities. The last of these aircraft also rolled off Boeing’s production line in 1962, 34 years before cables and connectors using first-generation USB technology first entered large-scale production. After 25 years, USB cables are something that most of us take for granted in our everyday lives as an industry standard for recharging various types of electronic devices, as well as connecting them to each other. Currently, “the short battery life of the tablets [that B-52 crews use] is a liability since they carry information critical to mission success,” according to the Air Force. “To compensate, aircrews carry several large lithium battery packs to ensure power to the tablets throughout long missions.” This is not necessarily an ideal workaround for the crews of the Air Force’s B-52Hs. For one, it can’t be content to have to remember to swap out batteries every few hours throughout a flight to ensure that there’s no loss, even temporarily, of critical information. Beyond that, the potential for lithium-ion batteries to experience a “ thermal runaway ,” and burst into flames or explode, is well established . It is a particularly well-known issue to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airliners, as well as government regulators who work with both industries. A series of battery fires in then-new Boeing 787s in 2013 notoriously led to the type being grounded in the United States and elsewhere, and highlighted the potential risks of these power sources, in general. In 2017, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considered implementing a total ban on lithium-ion batteries in checked baggage on commercial flights. Since then, FAA has banned people from checking bags with spare lithium-ion batteries, as well as electronic cigarettes and vaping devices that use them as a power source. Other devices that use these batteries can be put in checked baggage, but “these items should be protected from damage, accidental activation and short circuits” and “battery terminals should be protected by manufacturer’s packaging or covered with tape and placed in separate bags to prevent short circuits.” FAA asks that similar precautions be taken with regards to items in carry-on luggage, but there are no bans in place there since “smoke and fire incidents involving lithium batteries can be mitigated by the cabin crew and passengers inside the aircraft cabin.” A battery fire or explosion on a commercial airliner has the potential to be disastrous. A similar incident on a B-52H bomber, particularly one on a combat mission, could be equally bad and potentially have second-order impacts on ongoing operations that put other lives at risk as a result. “By having USB ports, we significantly reduce the chance of a fire potentially destroying a jet,” Lt. Col. Carroll, one of the two reservists behind the light/USB proposal, said. Unless otherwise resolved, the difficulties, risks, and general inconvenience associated with using lithium-ion battery packs in B-52H cockpits are set to persist for decades to come. The Air Force currently plans to keep flying these bombers through at least 2040, at which point the aircraft will have been in service for around a century, thanks to new engines and other much more intensive upgrades . Kenneth Pistone, one of the engineers from the B-52 SPO who recently traveled to Barksdale, said that a final plan for how to integrate the lights and USB ports in the B-52H’s cockpit could be ready within six to nine months. Back in June, Maj. Brandon Wolf, the director of LR WERX, said that if tests of the systems are successful then a modification process could be set up for the entire fleet of these bombers across the Air Force. All told, a technology that most of us use in some form every day could become a small, but significant new addition in the cockpits of America’s oldest bombers.

Randy Smith,"Updated on Jan 6, 2022",What It’s Like To Live And Work Inside White Sands Missile Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the early 1990s, White Sands Missile Range went from belonging to Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), which meant White Sands became part of China Lake , and my company’s support contract was extended to the Naval detachment there. Until that point, White Sands had petty officers running its information technology at the main White House building for the command. The range lacked any true, dedicated technical support — hence the job I applied for. Of course, with me being in-house and a known quantity, I got the job rather quickly. I was told New Mexico was a great place to live, and I would love it there. My wife and I flew out of Ontario, Calif., to the closest airport to White Sands, which is in El Paso, Texas. For those who are from small towns, landing in El Paso for the first time is a real treat. I was immediately alarmed about what I had gotten myself into from seeing the area for the first time. I was used to being moved around all my childhood and had been to many places, but, after years of working at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which you can read all about here , I was now acclimated to the small population of 35,000 in Ridgecrest. This was a little jolt that Toto wasn’t in Kansas anymore. From there we went to Las Cruces and got a room for the night. A map of New Mexico with an inset showing White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base., Google Maps We were not really interested in living in Los Cruces and had never commuted more than 15 minutes for a job in our lives. We were told that, if we asked the Army command sweetly enough, they might let us live in officer family housing on the base. The Army agreed and set us up. The cool part of it was they also gave us full access to the post exchange (PX), commissary, and the base schools. We were set and never needed to leave the base even for necessities — which later kind of became a curse. We went back to Ridgecrest, packed up our house in a U-Haul, said our goodbyes, and made the trip to New Mexico. Arriving At The Base White Sands Missile Range is nestled on the east side of the Organ Mountains, about 27 miles from Las Cruces on US 70. To the left of the gate is a neat museum that showcases many of the things tested at White Sands, from captured German V-2 rockets to the first atomic bomb . There are static stands with all types of weaponry, including some interesting flying-saucer-looking things that some claim are what was seen in Roswell instead of a crashed alien spacecraft. Rolling up to the front gate, you get your usual gate-guard check-in scenario to be allowed access to the base. The White Sands complex is quite large and inhabited mostly by the Army, but there also is a small Navy post where I would be working, plus some NASA facilities. There were no other contractors from my organization on-site, so I was pretty much the one and only to start. WSMR Museum As with many other naval installations, the White Sands command building is rather old. My wife and I met just about everyone in the building, including the petty officer who was holding the current computer infrastructure together by a shoestring. He was older and pretty close to retiring, and he didn’t take to me very well at first, but, eventually, I changed that. The network infrastructure was rather dismal, just a few old Mac servers. One of them ran a version of Mail for Mac even as the rest of NAVAIR was switching to Microsoft Exchange. Half the rooms weren’t even wired for Ethernet at the time and used Phonenet adapters for Appletalk communication. As a tenant on an Army base, the Navy piggybacked off the Army’s networks for external communication and internet access, which was TCP-based (transmission control protocol) only. The Navy’s Appletalk network wasn’t allowed on the Army’s networks. The whole command definitely needed a modernization effort, which was right up my alley. The first thing I did after getting settled was a tour of the locations where I would be working. I was headquartered at the command building, but there were outer locations to support as well. Heading out Nike Road took us on a journey to the Missile Assembly Facility (MAF), and farther down the road where the Desert Ship and LC-35 launch complex are. Navy missiles and the NASA Black Brant sounding rockets are tested there. Farther still was a little shop that maintained the orange-colored Firebee target drones. Outside the complex and some distance down US 70 is the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) complex, which houses a huge laser designed to fry unsuspecting objects out of the air (more on that later). And still farther down the US 70 is Holloman Air Force Base , which at the time housed all the operational F-117 combat squadrons . Missile Assembly Facility When you reach the MAF, you are greeted by a rather large building resembling a warehouse surrounded by a tall security fence with barbed wire and rotating warning lights every 50 yards to signal “Stay away!” when a missile was being assembled or tested. The entrance gate is located on the east side of the fence. The parking lot was a long walk away from the gate and building. Taking the tour of the facility is rather surreal, with big assembly stands in an open area, and everything positioned in a precise manner. Everything — from the walls to the doors — is blast-proof. There was even a blast-proof glassed-in control room facing into the area for testing rocket-propelled flying-death contraptions after they had been assembled. The area was clean enough to be a NASA probe assembly room. Building 1558, a Mills building — or just “the Mill” — and designated as Assembly Building II, was constructed in 1946, according to an official history of the White Sands Missile Range. It is shown here in a picture taken around 1968., Library of Congress The most striking thing in the building was an 8-inch-wide copper grounding bar that ran all along the walls within the building. Apparently, it is very necessary for you and whatever you are working with to be strapped to this bar when putting together missiles or rockets. If you aren’t grounded properly and there is a lightning strike in the area, or you are unfortunate enough to static out when working around live missiles, you and the whole place could end up a giant grease spot in the middle of the desert. My first time visiting this facility alone to perform job duties was pretty exhilarating. I had set up a new PC and was delivering it to the MAF. When I approached the compound, the gate was open and the lights weren’t flashing, so I drove right in rather than huffing this thing 100 yards from the parking lot. A rather angry-looking lieutenant commander came flying out the door proclaiming that my damn truck shouldn’t be there, and if I didn’t immediately move it back to the parking lot he was going to get the forklift and move it himself. Having been around the salty Navy types a lot, I casually glanced over at him while I was unloading the computer and informed him that, if he came anywhere within 50 feet of my truck, it would be the last thing he did. He turned bright red, huffed and puffed, and told me to hurry it up. I was a contractor, not one of his enlisted guys, so he knew there was very little he could do about it at the moment. Also, that guy had probably never in his life had someone stand up to him like that, and he was so impressed, we became best friends for the duration of my stay. I love making friends like that. LLS-1 – USS Desert Ship The Desert Ship , built in the 1950s, was a very interesting place to behold. It’s constructed of thick concrete, like a bunker, in case an unfortunate accident occurs. Inside at the time was a variety of equipment to launch missiles that replicated what would be on a real ship. I’m pretty sure most of this older stuff is gone by now, but, in my time, the room still held equipment that used old school vacuum tubes! I was flabbergasted seeing this. U.S. Navy There was also various recording equipment for testing purposes. Then, facing the launcher, was the launch control room, which contained various screens, fun buttons, and little tiny windows where you could see the launcher. It was a complete mix of old and new, and the guys that were on duty there knew their stuff inside and out. Outside was a vertical launcher located a little distance away from the main complex, connected via a long tunnel. I recall having a “pleasant” afternoon being claustrophobic in that tunnel while running cables one day. At the time we were there, Standard Missile 2 was the hot item the Navy was testing. We actually had the pleasure of watching an early morning launch and intercept by the SM-2 right from the front door of our house. It was pretty slick watching it do spirals trying to scrub speed and then going on to kill its target. The Navy tested other weapons at that time, too: the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), Tomahawk cruise missiles , and the Sea Sparrow missile , among others. We only got to witness the one SM-2 test during the short time we were there, unfortunately. The Ticonderoga -class guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam (CG-54) fires a Standard Missile (SM) 2., U.S. Navy / Mass Communication Specialist Seaman David Flewellyn High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility The most amazing location was HELSTF. HELSTF is located in between White Sands and Holloman on US 70. This compound houses one of the most powerful chemical lasers in the world. Nobody I knew had any idea how powerful — because that was top secret. Unless you know what you are looking for, you will drive right past the entrance road to get there. It’s not a highly publicized place, located far off the highway. A basic overall layout of WSMR and its surrounding features., WSMR The complex has various strange-looking buildings in different places connected by above-ground pipes with steam coming out of them in spots and HVAC farms all over the place. On my initial tour, I was told by our guide that in the future the whole complex setup would be shrunk down to fit on destroyers. We entered the multistory building where the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) system is housed. What can be seen on the bottom floor is nothing short of astounding. I recall many pipes and hydraulic rams connected to a huge moving wall that had channels in it for the mixture of whatever chemicals and energy to travel through on its path to the laser emitter. Apparently, this was to ensure the pathways inside were able to be inspected and cleaned when the two halves were separated. The SeaLite Beam Director, commonly used as the output for the mid-infrared chemical laser (MIRACL) at White Sands., U.S. Army via Wikimedia Going up to the second level, we found mirrors in cordoned-off areas. I assume — from the huge “DANGER!” signs everywhere — that’s where the energy flows from the bottom level. You probably would not want to be around those areas when this thing lit off or you would be incinerated instantly. The mirrors appeared to bounce the beam up another level that we didn’t go to. From the outside, the building doesn’t look like much — until the whole structure actually starts to move backward. What gets exposed after the building moves is a giant maneuverable laser emitter. There are several missile- and drone-kill markings on it, signifying what this thing has brought down in testing. Not too long before we arrived at WSMR, the MIRACL shot at a drone, in a test. Attached to the bottom of the drone was a two-inch-thick steel diamond plate. The plate was proudly displayed in the lobby, a melted hole about two feet in diameter in the middle of it. I remember thinking, “This is some serious Star Wars shit right here.” HELSTF has had its share of ups and downs over the years. At the time we were there, the entire complex was pretty much shut down because TRW (the contractor that built it) had their contract expire. Nobody else knew how to run the thing, so it was dormant. There was talk about using the laser system to recharge satellites, but I guess it eventually was shut down for good. NASA LC-35 is where NASA launches sounding rockets to test things in low-earth orbit. One of the NASA guys worked in the main shop with us and basically was the event recording and AV person for the launches. He had a need for a heavy-duty Macintosh with AV capabilities so he could edit launch movies and recordings from cameras attached to the rockets. He used it to stitch together a video of various scientific atmospheric reentry test instruments dropped from a rocket for the Mars lander test that took place when we were there. The video was mainly made for the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, but, on some copies, he dubbed in music from Pink Floyd with the video. Again, very cool to be remotely involved in interesting science, even if I was part of it only indirectly. The large tilting launch rails used for Aerobee rockets at LC-35. These rockets could travel dozens of miles into the upper atmosphere. , UC Boulder Down The Road At The Air Force Base Outside of work, the White Sands community was really involved in kids’ sports. White Sands teams often played against those of nearby towns, as well as a team at Holloman AFB. One day, we got an opportunity to go there for my son’s baseball game. Of course, there were F-117s all over, as the baseball diamond wasn’t far from the airfield. They were taking off and landing the whole day. So I was obviously ecstatic to be around cool aircraft again, because there wasn’t much to be seen from the missile range. National Archives Home On The Missile Range Like China Lake, WSMR’s personnel are a very tight-knit group. I knew just about everyone tied to the installation and, for the most part, we were one big family. My wife eventually got hired on and worked at the command building with me. She had worked as a civilian at China Lake for a number of years, so she fit right in, and everyone loved her. At one point, everyone who lived at the facility had to take an explosive recognition course with the explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) guys. Apparently, someone was driving out on the road that takes you from White Sands to El Paso and decided to stop and take a stroll. They found something on the ground. Not thinking, they picked it up. It was unexploded ordnance, and — of course — it exploded when they grabbed it. EOD reminded us to treat the whole entire facility as an active bombing range because sometimes undetected strays could be found. Comforting. The range is also inhabited with wild Oryx, a species of large antelope that have very long, sharp horns. They are not native to North America (they come from Africa), but the missile range experimented with introducing exotic animals in the 1960s, and now they are all over. An Oryx at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Oryx are native to Africa., Chris Short (FLICKR) via Wikimedia. CC 2.0 Oryx are not very nice. One day, we passed a family pulled off the side of the road that had stopped to see one. Apparently, they were trying to feed it when it promptly decided it didn’t care for them much and chased them back to their minivan. It then proceeded to run its horns completely through the van’s passenger door, much to the dismay of its terrified passengers. Working at White Sands was really fun, but, in hindsight, making the decision to live on the base was a pretty bad idea for my family and me. Though it was cheap, the living conditions were often rather isolating. No radio relays reached into the valley, so you pretty much were locked out of any current musical entertainment. The housing regulations and restrictions were rather strict regarding maintaining your yard, curfew, animal control, etc. — and rightfully so; it’s a military base. But we had a neighbor who was batshit crazy and liked to call the cops on me just for sitting on my porch in the evenings. My family wasn’t happy with it, and we began to discuss if maybe it was time to go back to China Lake. But by that time, the people in the command building were head over heels about what I had been doing and really didn’t want me or my wife leaving. I was told they would rather shoot me than see me leave. Again, comforting. We had a change of command, and the new captain was impressed with my support but wanted to know what type of training I had. I told him self-taught, and he said that wouldn’t fly and requested my employer to get me classes to get Microsoft Systems Certification. I saw this as an opportunity to market myself better to get another job and get out of there. I studied and took tests every two weeks to get my certification. There were days I didn’t see daylight, because all I did was study the whole time. Within eight weeks, I was certified. Not long after, I landed a job at Lake Tahoe, of all places. I didn’t want to leave a job associated with the DOD, but we definitely didn’t want to stay there any longer. After what my wife terms as exactly “2.4 years,” we announced we would be moving on. We made some pretty cool friends, not only with the enlisted guys, but also with many of the officers. The command threw us a party and gave us a few traditional mementos usually reserved for military personnel, which made us feel very much part of this unique team. It was a great job, and I would miss the camaraderie greatly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 31, 2022",The Last Class Of Air Force F-15C Eagle Weapons Instructors Has Graduated,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The last class of U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter pilots has graduated from the Weapons Instructor Course at the Air Force Weapons School . After more than four decades, this training program has come to an end as the service works toward replacing its aging F-15Cs with new F-15EX Eagle II fighters. The final Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) class involving F-15Cs, known as WIC 21-B, concluded at the Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada on Dec. 8, but the Air Force only announced that this would be the last such class yesterday. Eagle pilots taking part in WIC 21-B capped things off with a final defensive counter-air evolution, a training mission focused on honing skills for protecting friendly assets and territory from enemy aircraft. This is a primary mission set for the Air Force’s remaining fleet of F-15C/Ds, many of which are based in the United States and are also tasked with protecting America’s airspace . Air Force Weapon Schools instructors and students, among others, walk on the flightline at Nellis Air Force Base after the conclusion of the final defensive counter-air evolution for WIC class 21-B., USAF The WIC program certifies highly trained instructors for various types of aircraft, as well as certain other kinds of operational specialties , and then sends them back to their home stations to share that knowledge with others in their units. Each WIC class spends months at the Air Force Weapon School going through extremely challenging training on the ground and in the air. WIC graduates are often referred to as ‘patch wearers’ in reference to the distinct shoulder patch they are authorized to put on their uniforms, which marks them as a guru for tactics implantation and instruction at their parent units. An example of the Weapons Instructor Course graduate patch., USAF The Weapons School at Nellis has been putting students through instructor training related to the F-15C since 1978, the year before the type officially entered service, according to the Air Force . The C variant of the F-15, along with the two-seat F-15D, subsequently replaced earlier F-15A and B types. F-15A/Bs had started being delivered in the early 1970s, but they only formally entered service in 1976. “The F-15 has some advances, but it’s still the F-15 from the 1970s in a lot of ways,” Air Force Maj. Michael Tope, the leader of the F-15C portion of WIC 21-B, said in a statement. “That speaks to the capabilities of the maintainers and the people who have worked on the jets, as well as the instructors who have developed different tactics.” At present, the Air Force has just under 220 F-15C/Ds still in inventory. The service’s plan to replace those jets with new production F-15EX aircraft, a design Boeing derived from Advanced Eagle variants it had developed for foreign customers in recent years, first emerged in 2018 . The Eagle II is the most advanced F-15 variant Boeing has produced to date and features major capability improvements over older Eagles thanks to its new radar , electronic warfare suite , open-architecture software , the ability to carry hypersonic missiles and other new weapons , the capability to work together with “loyal wingman” type drones , and much more, as you can read about in detail here . The Air Force sees these non-stealthy aircraft as an important complement to existing and future stealth fighters as part of a planned force structure that will provide a valuable mix of higher and lower-end capabilities for years to come. As it stands now, the Air Force hopes to buy at least 144 Eagle IIs , though this number could very well grow in the future, especially if the decision is made to supplant the service’s F-15E Strike Eagles with these newer jets, as well. The Air Force has taken delivery of two prototype F-15EXs already and has received funds to buy 20 examples, in total, so far from Congress. The latest version of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2022 Fiscal Year, which is currently awaiting a decision by President Joe Biden to either sign it into law or veto it, authorizes funding for another 17 of these jets. The Air Force’s two F-15EX prototypes., USAF The Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing , which runs the service’s only F-15C/D schoolhouse, is set to be the first unit to get F-15EXs, the first of which are scheduled to arrive in the 2024 Fiscal Year. If all goes to plan, Oregon’s 142nd Fighter Wing , based in Portland, will become the first operational unit to fly these jets starting in the following fiscal cycle. At the same time, F-15C/Ds will remain in operational service, as well as potentially in test and evaluation roles, for some time still. The Eagles that presently fly in support of the Weapon School are now set to be distributed between Air National Guard and test units. As such, there will remain some need for Eagle weapons instructor over at least the next few years. Since the Air Force will not be training any new ones going forward, this led to some changes in the course structure for the F-15C pilots in WIC 21-B. “We spent a little bit more time on the critical thinking concept rather than finessing the individual Eagle execution that they should already know,” Air Force Maj. Rodolfo Cruz, the Director of Operations for the Air Force Weapon School’s 433rd Weapons Squadron, said in a statement. “We had to think about how we as the Weapons School think about problems, so that when the graduates go out into the Combat Air Force, they can think about the problems in the same manner.” Still, the Air Force’s remaining F-15C/Ds are clearly in the twilight of their careers. An F-15C, in the foreground, flies together with an F-15E Strike Eagle, at center, and an F-15EX Eagle II, in the background., USAF “We are having to pivot as an Air Force,” Maj. Tope, the F-15C class leader for WIC 21-B, said. “We train against the current threats and to be ready in case we need to employ. The baseline threat has changed so much, and the ranges at which people are shooting and dying in air-to-air war have increased so significantly over the last 20 years it is pretty incredible.” “I love the F-15C,” Maj. Cruz, the 433rd Weapons Squadron DIrector of Operations, added. “I don’t want it to die, but we have to move on, because if we continue to rest on our laurels, it’s going to make the fight that much harder for us.” The graduation of the final class of F-15C weapons instructors from the Air Force Weapon School is just the latest sign that the era of the Air Force’s standard Eagle is coming to an end.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 16, 2020",United Kingdom Details Plans To Build Future Fighter Jet Engine With Japan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom and Japan have announced plans to jointly develop a prototype fighter jet engine as they both pursue programs focused on fielding new-generation fighter jets, under the Tempest and F-X programs . The latest agreement is part of an expanding military relationship between the two countries, which also includes sharing air-to-air missile technologies. The U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) today announced details of the agreement, a Memorandum of Cooperation, within which the Anglo-Japanese fighter jet engine is the flagship item. Work on the joint engine demonstrator will begin early next year with the United Kingdom investing an initial £30 million in “planning, digital designs, and innovative manufacturing developments.” Beyond that, the MOD says that another £200 million, or around $266.6 million at the present rate of conversion, of funding from the United Kingdom will lead to the development of a full-scale demonstrator power system, which will apparently be built at Rolls-Royce’s Filton facility in Bristol, England. In addition, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) in Japan, and BAE Systems in the United Kingdom will be involved. No details of expected performance have been released and at this stage, it’s unclear if the so-called demonstrator engine will be installed in a flying testbed or if it will be used exclusively for ground-based static trials. It’s also unconfirmed at this stage whether the Tempest and F-X — if they both progress as planned — will be powered by a common engine. Both designs are planned as twin-engine fighters. “This initiative with Japan is a win-win opportunity to develop world-beating power technologies together,” said Richard Berthon, U.K. Director Future Combat Air. “Investing and working together with Japan to demonstrate highly advanced engine systems will boost our national industries and design a cutting-edge military capability. We’re looking forward to getting started on this work and continuing our discussions on further collaboration.” A Tempest mock-up at the Farnborough International Air Show in 2018., BAE Systems Under the Memorandum of Cooperation, the United Kingdom and Japan will also look at joint work on other technologies connected to the U.K.’s Combat Air Strategy, the centerpiece of which is a manned fighter jet , known as Tempest. Team Tempest also includes Italian defense contractor Leonardo , European missile consortium MBDA , and the British Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as Rolls-Royce. “The industry teams in both the U.K. and Japan bring complementary technologies that will drive cleaner, next-generation power and propulsion for both nations’ future fighter requirements,” said Alex Zino, Director of Business Development and Future Programs at Rolls-Royce. “The joint engine demonstrator program is an exciting opportunity to bring together some of the best combat air capabilities in the world and will also enable the development of innovative and critical technologies that will be fundamental to the future of the defense aerospace industry.” We do already know a little about Rolls-Royce’s plans for the Tempest engine, with engineers having already evaluated advanced engine technology . In the past, the company has described a new engine that will burn hotter than its predecessors, boosting efficiency. The British engine company has also been working with Leonardo to manage the heat generated by multiple onboard sensors and avionics by directing this back into the engines for cooling. Team Tempest is also known to have been examining the use of synthetic aviation fuel to reduce exhaust temperatures and also increase sustainability. Rolls-Royce For Japan, meanwhile, the latest agreement with the United Kingdom raises questions about the role of its own fighter propulsion efforts. MHI completed a single example of the X-2 Shinshin experimental aircraft that has been used as a technology demonstrator for its future fighter program. The twin-engined X-2 is powered by IHI XF5 turbofans, each of which develops around 11,000 pounds of thrust and has thrust-vectoring exhaust paddles for maneuverability. It had been expected that the F-X would eventually be powered by IHI’s in-development XF9 engine, which would have offered significantly more thrust than the XF5. With IHI now collaborating with Rolls-Royce, the role that the XF9 will play within this is not clear. The United Kingdom is developing the Tempest under the Combat Air Strategy, which is due to receive £2 billion, or around $2.6 billion at the time of writing, in funding over the next four years. The plan is to field a complete Future Combat Air System, including a manned replacement for the Typhoon fighter jet , starting in the mid-2030s. BAE SYSTEMS Earlier this year, the U.K.’s Concept and Assessment phase for the Future Combat Air System was launched with a contract valued at £250-million, or approximately $333 million. As well as the Tempest fighter, the U.K.’s Future Combat Air System (not to be confused with the pan-European project of the same name) includes work on unmanned aircraft , sensors, weapons, and advanced data systems. At the same time, Japan is engaged in its own F-X next-generation fighter program, which plans to provide a successor to the Mitsubishi F-2 over a similar timescale. A Royal Air Force Typhoon (left) takes part in Exercise Northern Guardian alongside Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2 fighters at Misawa Air Base, Japan. , Crown Copyright Developing an all-new new fighter jet is a significant undertaking and many have questioned whether either the United Kingdom or Japan have developed business models that will be able to succeed without major external support or collaboration. With that in mind, pooling the technological and industrial strengths of the two countries seems to make good sense. Tokyo and London coming together to develop the new powerplant for their future fighters is also an expression of wider military cooperation between the two countries. Central to this is the United Kingdom increasingly switching its strategic and military priorities to the Asia Pacific region, with an eye on China’s burgeoning territorial ambitions and military expansion. “Strengthening our partnerships in the Indo-Pacific is a strategic priority and this commitment with Japan, one of our closest security partners in Asia, is a clear example of that,” said U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in a statement regarding the engine deal. “As I have seen at first hand our partners in Japan have made enormous progress on technologies that can complement our own advanced skills and could help ensure both our armed forces remain at the forefront of military innovation,” added the U.K. Defense Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin. The expanding scope of U.K.-Japanese military cooperation was outlined in the U.K.’s Defense Command Paper published earlier this year. Since then, the Royal Navy’s flagship aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth completed its first operational deployment, Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21), which took it to the Asia Pacific region and included joint maneuvers with Japan. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopter carrier Ise underway in the Pacific, with an F-35B Lightning jet from HMS Queen Elizabeth in the foreground. , Crown Copyright In October, meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Japan agreed to commence formal negotiations on a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) to further deepen their bilateral defense relationship. Also related to the bilateral cooperation on future air combat technologies is the U.K. MOD’s support to Japan’s Joint New Air-to-Air Missile program, or JNAAM . This weapon is expected to combine British expertise relating to the MBDA Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) with a Japanese-developed advanced radio frequency (RF) seeker. In addition to Japan, the United Kingdom has been seeking other international partners to join Team Tempest. So far, this has included signing Memorandums of Understanding with Italy and Sweden, with a view to collaborating on future combat air systems and technologies. In the past, there has been speculation that the rival British-led and Franco-German-Spanish future air combat programs will eventually be brought together . “It is natural that these two realities will merge into one,” General Luca Goretti, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Air Force, told members of the country’s parliamentary defense committees last month, according to a report from Reuters . “Investing huge financial resources in two equivalent programs is unthinkable.” However, Air Cdre Jonny Moreton, U.K. Program Director Future Combat Air Program at the MOD, told Tim Martin of Shephard News: “We have absolutely no intention of joining a French-German-Spanish future combat air system program.” Already, there have been reports in the Japanese press suggesting that the Tempest and F-X will share not only engines but also “air intakes … and the area near the exhaust” and that these components will be optimized for stealth. Concept artwork of a possible F-X fighter configuration., Japanese Ministry of Defense Ultimately, it’s not inconceivable that Japan could merge its own F-X with the British-led project. Japan has already stated its plan to have MHI lead the F-X project, with overall responsibility for the aircraft’s development, but that an overseas partner will also be involved in the program. Whether that partner will be the United Kingdom, or if a U.S. aerospace contractor will step in to work on elements other than the powerplant, is unclear. While many questions remain about the nature of the new engine and its capabilities, it certainly looks as though Japan is set to become more deeply involved as a Tempest partner.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 9, 2023",Incredible Images Of A Stripped-Down F-22 Raptor Being Rebuilt After A Belly Landing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it is hopefully just months away from completing what will be a nearly four-year-long effort to return a seriously damaged F-22 Raptor stealth fighter to service. In highlighting this intensive repair effort, and the airmen behind it, the service has offered a look at the innards of a Raptor unlike any we have seen in the past. The public affairs office at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or JBER, in Alaska released the new details about the work that has gone into restoring 07-4146 on Dec. 21, 2021. This base is home to the 3rd Wing. This Raptor, which has the serial number 07-4146, went skidding along the runway on its belly at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada after a botched takeoff attempt in April 2018. It was one of four jets from the 3rd Fighter Wing’s 90th Fighter Squadron that had deployed to Fallon to support a graduation exercise for the U.S. Navy’s famous Topgun fighter pilot training program. A low-quality picture of 07-4146 on its belly at Fallon in 2018., Anonymous contributor The Air Force determined that the cause of the accident was incorrect takeoff and landing data based on the runway length at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, as well as the altitude at which that facility lies, which is different from that at Fallon. So, when the pilot at the controls of 07-4146, who had also retracted the aircraft’s landing gear sooner than they should have, attempted to get airborne, there was insufficient lift and the jet came right back down on the runway. The pilot was thankfully unharmed in the incident. How much it will ultimately cost the Air Force to get this F-22 back in service is unknown, but The War Zone has already reached out for more information about the repair bill. In 2017, the service disclosed that it would approximately $25 million to return a different Raptor that had been kept in flyable storage to service as a test jet. That aircraft was not severely damaged like 07-4146, but that cost did include the price of upgrading it from an older standard to a more up-to-date configuration. Regardless, it is clear that the damage to 07-4146 was extensive. It took a month for a team of Air Force personnel who had traveled to Fallon to safely dismantle the Raptor so that it could be transported back to its home base in Alaska via a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane. “We had to fit it into a C-5, so we took off everything that was damaged and everything that wouldn’t fit dimensionally,” Air Force Staff Sgt. Ethan Rentz, an F-22 crew chief from the 3rd Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU), who has been involved in the entire repair process, said. “We removed the wings and vertical stabilizers, and the whole belly of the F-22 because those panels were damaged and burnt. We couldn’t have those panels flapping around or breaking off during transit.” USAF USAF USAF It would take more than a year of running models and simulations to determine whether or not the aircraft was salvageable and devise a plan for repairing it. “Everything worked out in the simulations, so the aircraft was put in our hangar in January 2020 and put on stands,” Air Force Tech. Sgt. Kevin Fitch, another F-22 crew chief from the 3rd AMU who has been involved in this work, said. “That’s when the complete strip started – the wire harnesses, the struts, and the bulkhead. It was down to the bones of the fuselage at that point.” “Contractors, engineers, and structures personnel spent about 16 months replacing almost the whole bottom of the aircraft, the fuselage stations, and more than 40 wire harnesses,” Fitch added. “Our active-duty guys didn’t start having a hand in the rebuild until June this year.” USAF USAF USAF Repairing 07-4146, really more of a complete refurbishment of the aircraft from how the Air Force has described it, is made all the more complicated by the fact that the F-22 is long out of production and the Air Force’s total fleet of these jets is relatively small. At present, there are only around 186 Raptors in service, of which some 125 are assigned to combat-coded units. The rest are set aside for training and test and evaluation purposes or are sidelined due to other reasons. Rentz said that Fitch has been “coordinating with multiple different [maintenance] backshops and agencies” to source the parts necessary to get 07-4146 flying again. Parts recovered from the jet after the accident or otherwise retained during the repair process, including things as small as fasteners made to extremely high tolerances that are important for keeping the aircraft’s radar cross-section as small as possible, have also gone back into the aircraft. An Air Force maintainer cleans fasteners as part of the rebuilding of 07-4146., USAF “Right now the biggest challenge is acquiring parts because the F-22 isn’t manufactured anymore,” Fitch explained. The Raptor being out of production is just one part of the issue. After all this time, subcontractors who made certain components may no longer even be in existence and the institutional knowledge of how to build them may have been lost along the way, requiring costly re-engineering . The Air Force’s goal now is to get the jet back in service, at least technically, by March 2022. “Some of the parts won’t be available until summer or fall of 2022, so we’ll probably end up canning those from aircraft that are going to be down for a while,” Fitch added. Canning, a colloquial term for cannibalizing parts from other aircraft, is a common practice across the Air Force, especially for low-density, high-demand types like the F-22. In addition, Raptors are notoriously maintenance intensive and the fleet’s readiness rate, on average, is typically around 50 percent . So, 3rd Wing undoubtedly has other jets sidelined that can give up parts to help get 07-4146 back on the flightline. F-22s on the ramp in the snow at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in 2013., USAF The small size of the Air Force’s fleet of F-22s, which remains one of its most advanced stealth fighters, is a key reason for expending the time and money to return jets like 07-4146 to service, if at all possible. The decision to dramatically curtail Raptor orders in 2009 by then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has turned out to have been immensely short-sighted as competition with China and Russia has grown, raising an increased specter of potential high-end conflicts. Just this year, the Air Force sent roughly a fifth of its combat-coded F-22s to Guam for an exercise that was clearly meant to, at least in part, send signals to the Chinese. The service, together with Lockheed Martin, continues to upgrade the Raptors , as well, including giving them the ability to fire AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and additional communications capabilities. Of course, all of this is set to become increasingly moot as the Air Force formalizes its schedule for retiring its F-22s in favor of a new manned stealth fighter being developed under its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The service confirmed earlier this year that the Raptor does not factor into its current long-term force structure plans. In the meantime, keeping as many F-22s as possible operational remains important to the Air Force. “It’s really important we get this jet back in flight,” Fitch said. “Five months ago it had no struts, no wings, no flight controls, no hydraulics, no stabilizers. Seeing the progress and doing something out of the ordinary has been really rewarding.” U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Kevin Fitch, at left, and Staff Sgt. Ethan Rentz, at right, F-22 crew chiefs from the 3rd Aircraft Maintenance Unit who have been involved in the rebuilding of 07-4146., USAF If everything goes to plan, 07-4146 should be back flying with 3rd Wing by the end of next Spring.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 22, 2022",Pentagon Team Has Returned From Assessing Ukraine’s Air Defense Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A small Department of Defense team recently returned from Ukraine after a trip to that country to discuss and evaluate its air and missile defense needs . This comes as Ukrainian officials continue to warn that Russia could be just weeks away from launching a new major military intervention against their country, which might involve a flurry of air and missile strikes that they currently have relatively limited capabilities to defend against. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby mentioned the team’s return at a press conference earlier today, but did not have any further details to share about the results of the trip. Air Force Magazine , citing a senior Ukrainian defense official, reported that the team was on the ground earlier this month , but is not entirely clear when they first arrived. The group was also in the country to discuss Ukraine’s ability to respond to Russian naval , electronic warfare , and cyber warfare threats, not just air and missile defenses, according to that outlet. Air and missile defense capacity has been a growing point of concern for Ukraine vis a vis Russia since 2014. That year, the Kremlin seized the Crimean Peninsula from the government in Kyiv and subsequently began actively supporting ostensibly local “separatist” groups, which all have significant ties to Russian intelligence agencies , in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region. Since then, the Ukrainian government has worked to bolster its capabilities with an eye toward deterring further Russian encroachment , or at least being able to better respond to it should it occur. While there had been some efforts to increase the country’s air and missile defense capabilities, as well as its own fleets of combat aircraft and longer-range missiles, the Ukrainian military still relies mostly on aging Soviet designs and refurbished and modernized derivatives thereof. “We have a well-developed and a powerful land force,” Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov said at a press conference during a visit to Washington, D.C. in November. “The need is an air defense and missile defense.” There have been reports for weeks now that President Joe Biden’s administration has been actively engaged in discussions with Ukrainian officials about what air and missile defense capabilities the U.S. government might be able to provide in the near term. Media reports have regularly talked about Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, as well as Stinger shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), as potential options. These same deliberations have reportedly covered other kinds of military assistance , including the potential transfer to Ukrainian forces of Mi-17 helicopters and other assets that previously belonged to the now-defunct Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, or were earmarked for them, but never delivered. A significant hurdle in any such discussions is likely the U.S. government’s disinterest in deploying actual American troops to Ukraine on missions where they might be called upon to directly engage Russian forces. What this means is that simply sending things like U.S. Army Patriot batteries, which are in short supply to begin with, to the country is unlikely to be on the table at all. US Army personnel fire a Patriot surface-to-air missile during an exercise in Romania in June 2021., US Army Selling or otherwise transferring Patriots to Ukraine directly, something officials in Kyiv have previously expressed interest in , would almost certainly be a complex process legally and logistically. On top of that, Ukrainian forces have no experience with that system and would have to be trained to operate it effectively. All of this would take time, something that is in short supply in the current crisis, with Ukrainian and U.S. officials, among others, warning that a new Russian intervention could come as soon as January or February. MANPADS like Stinger , many of which can also be fired by launchers mounted on light vehicles , would be easier for Ukrainian troops to become proficient with. American allies in Europe, such as Poland , produce more modern designs that are derived from Soviet-era systems that might be better suited to Ukraine’s needs, as well. At the same time, unfortunately, these shorter-range systems offer only point defense capabilities that could be of limited effectiveness by themselves against an onslaught of Russian aircraft and missiles. Even so, they would still impose a cost on the Kremlin. “Even with weak air defenses, we can shoot down a couple aircraft,” an anonymous Ukrainian official told Air Force Magazine earlier this month. “How many casualties will they sustain?” A US Army Avenger air defense system, which has two launchers that each hold four Stinger missiles, as well as a .50 caliber M3P machine gun, is seen here mounted on a Humvee light tactical vehicle., US Army With nothing in American inventory air defense-wise between Patriot and Stinger, not counting the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) that the U.S. Army has arrayed around Washington, D.C., the U.S. military just has limited options when it comes to what it might be able to easily transfer or otherwise expedite the export of. Various American allies and partners do operate middle-tier surface-to-air missile systems that might be better suited to Ukraine’s current needs, or help them field a more comprehensive air and missile defense network. However, similar kinds of procedural, logistical, and training issues would still apply and limit the Ukrainian military’s ability to truly field any new systems. The U.S. government could try to source additional Soviet-era systems of various kinds that Ukrainian forces do have more experience with from third countries, which could include any stockpiles of such weapons that might still remain in former Warsaw Pact countries that are now part of NATO. These are all almost certainly the kinds of issues that the Pentagon team has been sent to discuss with Ukraine in the first place. At the same time, as these discussions drag out, the sense of urgency is only likely to grow. American and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed that there are no indications that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a firm decision to launch a new major offensive against his neighbor. However, the Kremlin has deployed tens of thousands of ground troops near Russia’s borders with Ukraine and has postured itself to rapidly increase that number , as well as sustain all of these forces during extended combat operations. The Russian military is also regularly demonstrating its air and naval capabilities in the region. This included sending a pair of Tu-22M3 bombers on a patrol over neighboring Belarus , which is embroiled in a separate crisis with its European neighbors to the west, this weekend. Last week, the Russian government also put out a pair of draft security agreements that included a list of impossible demands for the United States and NATO in order to defuse tensions with Ukraine. U.S. Senator Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and the top member of his party on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, derided the proposals as “trying to create a pretext for war.” With all this in mind, the Pentagon team that recently went to Ukraine is undoubtedly aware of the importance of bolstering Ukraine’s air and missile defense capabilities and doing so as quickly as possible. At the same time, their conclusions and recommendations will have into account the various realities that limit what the U.S. government can realistically do in the near term.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2021",Damaged Submarine USS Connecticut has Finally Made It Home To Washington State (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures, together with online ship tracking data, indicate that the U.S. Navy’s seriously damaged Seawolf class nuclear attack submarine USS Connecticut has finally returned home to Washington State. The submarine left San Diego, California, last week , where it had spent just a few days in port after making what could have been a hellish trek for those on board across the Pacific Ocean from Guam. It had spent some two months in Guam after limping there following a collision with an underwater seamount in the South China Sea on Oct. 2, 2021. Twitter user @drimcalban posted pictures yesterday of what appears to be the USS Connecticut at Naval Magazine Indian Island , a part of Naval Base Kitsap on the Puget Sound in Washington, which also includes the submarine’s homeport of Bremerton. He also shared ship tracking data showing a pair of tugs sailing with the stricken submarine, as well as a U.S. Coast Guard escort. This is all very similar to the assortment of accompanying vessels that were seen when the submarine appeared at and then departed from San Diego. At the time of writing, the Navy does not appear to have issued a public statement about the arrival of Connecticut in Washington. The War Zone has reached out for more information. In November, in announcing that the submarine’s captain, executive officer, and chief of the boat had all been relieved, the service had said that the ultimate plan was to get the Seawolf class submarine back to its homeport for extensive repairs. The exact extent of the damage to Connecticut remains unclear, but pictures and video of the submarine in San Diego confirmed that its forward sonar dome is now missing. There have also been reports that sections of the bottom of the boat’s hull were damaged in the accident that have made it unsafe for it to dive. The likely need to sail on the surface, together with the physical damage, would have made its transit from Guam to San Diego and then up the coast to the Puget Sound very uncomfortable at best, as The War Zone has previously explained . If Connecticut is now indeed back home, which by every indication it is, the Navy can now turn its attention to the complex task of getting the submarine back into service. This will be a costly and time-consuming process made all the more so by the exquisite nature of the Navy’s advanced and secretive Seawolf class boats, only three of which were ever made and that you can read more about here . We will update this story with any additional information we receive about Connecticut ‘s status. Updated 3:05 PM EST: The U.S. Navy has now confirmed that USS Connecticut is at Naval Magazine Indian Island. “USS Connecticut (SSN 22) is at Naval Magazine Indian Island. The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition,” Navy Commander Cindy Fields, spokesperson for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, told The War Zone in a statement.

This module was seen displayed next to others that are clearly designed to hold small munitions or other expendable payloads. U.S. Army Gen. Richard Clarke, head of U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), was showing these payload options for the RQ-21, among other things, during a visit to the Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC) headquarters in San Diego, California, earlier this month. NSWC oversees the Navy’s elite SEAL teams , as well as other naval special operations units . The captions attached to the pictures of Clarke’s visit that show the Blackjack misidentify it as a ScanEagle drone , a smaller and distinctly different Boeing Insitu design. An individual assigned to Naval Special Warfare Command, at left, shows payload modules for the RQ-21 Blackjack, including one holding a small quadcopter-type drone, to U.S. Army Gen. Richard Clarke, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, on Dec. 13, 2021., U.S. Navy Within the U.S. military, both the Navy and Marine Corps operate RQ-21s, though the latter service is now in the process of divesting its entire fleet of these drones as part of a major overall of its entire force structure that you can read more about here . One of the Blackjack’s key features is the modular payload space in the center of its fuselage. Small wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) sensor systems, radars with imaging and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) functionality, and signal intelligence suites are among the payloads that are already known to be available for this unmanned aircraft. It also has a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras under its nose. However, this appears to be the first look at this drone-launching module for the RQ-21, and it looks to be small enough to be installed on a Blackjack in combination with other payloads. In this case, there seems to be an optical sensor of some kind, which may be entirely unrelated, installed in front of the section holding the quadcopter. A closer look at the payload module holding the quadcopter-type drone, with what appears to be a separate optical sensor system of some kind behind a window at the top. , U.S. Navy It is unclear whether or not this particular system can recover the smaller drone in flight after it completes its mission, but it seems unlikely from what we can see. The exact kinds of quadcopters it is designed to deploy are not immediately clear, but the one loaded onto it for the display certainly shares a general look of various commercially available types that are typically fitted with various types of small video cameras. It does appear to be smaller than the current generation ShieldAI Nova quadcopter, which is seen on display on a nearby table, has visual similarities to older Nova types . Nova-series quadcopters have been in use by Navy special operators for years now. Another look at the payload module offers a comparative view between its quadcopter drone and the ShieldAI Nova in the foreground., U.S. Navy An older ShieldAI Nova design., Chris Randour/Shield AI Regardless, an RQ-21 that is able to deploy its own smaller drone during a mission could open up a number of new operational possibilities. The most obvious would be a way to extend the reach of the Blackjack’s reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities, potentially in a very up-close-and-personal way. A video camera-carrying quadcopter deployed by an RQ-21 could swoop down for a closer peek at targets on the ground, maybe even look into a structure via a window and get a better sense of what’s going on inside. It might be possible to configure the quadcopter that is seen fitted to the module in the picture, or others that the system might be able to deploy, to carry other kinds of payloads beyond cameras. However, the smaller drone’s overall size and its own power requirements for propulsion would limit its ability to carry things like radio relay nodes or electronic warfare packages capable of broadcasting their signals across a very long range, although they may be useful in a stand-in, high-localized manner. Another possibility could be the addition of a warhead, allowing it to act as a loitering munition, or “suicide drone,” but again, the warhead would have to be small. Regardless, there is growing interest in what one might describe as ‘nested’ unmanned aircraft, larger types capable of launching and maybe even recovering smaller ones in flight, for many of these same reasons. As an example, earlier this year, L3Harris announced that it had partnered with ShieldAI to test its FVR-90 , a vertical takeoff and landing capable drone that is similar in general size to the RQ-21, as an aerial launch platform for Nova-series quadcopters. The Navy has at least evaluated the FVR-90 for its own use, including from remote and austere locations, in the past. An L3Harris FVR-90 drone loaded with a pair of ShieldAI Nova-series quadcopters., L3Harris In addition, advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other relevant technologies are set to give drones of various sizes ever-increasing autonomous capabilities, which could allow these entirely unmanned teams a greater ability to conduct various missions across broader areas on their own. With this in mind, it’s interesting to note that David Breed, head of SOCOM’s Program Executive Office for Special Reconnaissance (PEO-Special Reconnaissance), said that “collaborative autonomous platforms” was one of three key areas of focus for his office during a media roundtable on the sidelines of this year’s Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) back in May. In U.S. military parlance, the term “ special reconnaissance ” refers to intelligence-gathering missions that take place in denied or otherwise sensitive areas. Between 2020 and 2021, PEO-Special Reconnaissance took over responsibility for managing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in what the U.S. military refers to as Groups 1 through 3 across the U.S. military’s special operations community. These groups collectively include types like the RQ-21, with maximum weights under 1,320 pounds — and that are typically much lighter than that — as well as top speeds of under 250 knots and that cannot fly higher than 18,000 feet. Those drone programs had previously fallen under the purview of SOCOM’s Program Executive Office for Fixed Wing (PEO-FW) aircraft. A SOCOM PEO-FW briefing slide from 2017 showing examples of drones in different groups being used at that time across the U.S. special operations community. Responsibility for managing unmanned aircraft programs in Groups 1 through 3 has since been transferred to PEO-Special Reconnaissance. Larger Group 4 and 5 drones remain under the purview of PEO-FW. The weights and maximum combat radiuses shown here reflect the capabilities of the types actually in service, not the exact parameters of the five groups as defined by the Department of Defense. , SOCOM Breed’s comments at the media roundtable could also provide insight into the other expendable payload options for the RQ-21 that were on display during SOCOM chief Clarke’s visit to NSWC headquarters this month. At least as of May, another one of the three key areas of focus for PEO-Special Reconnaissance was advanced unattended ground sensors. These kinds of sensors, which are often camouflaged in some way, have been in use to varying degrees by the U.S. military since the Vietnam War. They are most commonly associated with a then-cutting edge and controversial distributed sensor network that was employed during that conflict to try to keep tabs on North Vietnamese movements along the so-called Ho Chi Minh Trail , a collection of routes established to funnel personnel and material into South Vietnam via neighboring Laos and Cambodia. Similar sensors have been used with much less fanfare since then, with the general idea being that they offer a more discreet and less manpower-intensive way to monitor an opponent’s movements and other activities in certain areas, including behind enemy lines. Unfortunately, emplacing them in the first place can be a complicated proposition . The video below shows a power drill-driven hoist-and-claw system tested by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan as a means to precisely deploy unattended ground sensors from helicopters in hard-to-reach areas without having to land. “Yes, that’s absolutely a focus of effort for us now, or at least what we’re looking for – remote emplacement of sensors,” Breed said in response to a question from The War Zone during the media roundtable. “So, [we’re] looking at the smaller UAS platforms that are now within our portfolio and how do we deploy unattended ground sensors with those platforms.” “There’s been some research and development in there, we’ve seen some demonstrations with different types of payloads and different types of sensors, but there’s nothing really in the production line yet. It is definitely an area of interest,” he continued. “Historically, we’ve had ease of access to places where we wanted to put sensors. Going forward, looking across the portfolio, we’d like to make sure that we can emplace those sensors in areas we don’t have that ease of access.” A drone like the RQ-21 would certainly offer a potentially lower-risk and less detectable option for emplacing these sensors, especially in areas that are harder to reach physically or for other operational reasons. SOCOM head U.S. Army Gen. Richard Clarke gestures at the RQ-21 on display during his visit to NSWC headquarters., U.S. Navy Of course, unattended ground sensors are just one expendable payload possibility. Expandable electronic warfare jammers , small munitions , and even bundles of psychological warfare leaflets are just some of the other potential options. The U.S. military, as a whole, is increasingly interested in the idea of using smaller unmanned aircraft to conduct resupply missions , as well. While an RQ-21 might not be able to drop a large amount of cargo, they could be able to transport useful amounts of ammunition, medical supplies, spare parts, or other items to personnel in the field, even in the middle of firefight. We don’t know if any of these payload modules are even in active service or if Naval Special Warfare Command is still testing them. What is clear is that the Navy’s special operations community is very interested in the future possibility of using the RQ-21 to deploy smaller drones and other payloads.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 25, 2021",Russia’s Predator-Like Drone Is Now Shooting Down Other Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has been testing its Orion unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a ‘drone-killer’ role, using a new variant of an existing guided missile to shoot down a rotary-wing target drone during trials in Crimea. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the experiment proves that the Predator-like Orion drone is now capable of engaging other drones in combat, part of a broader effort to introduce various new weapons capabilities to this and other Russian UAVs. Video of the test campaign was released recently by the Russian Ministry of Defense and was apparently first shown as part of a documentary on the state-owned Russia-1 TV channel. The Orion drone — also known by the project name Inokhodets, meaning Pacer in Russian — is shown firing a new air-launched version of the 9M113 Kornet anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) against the helicopter drone, serving as the target. The report states that the two drones began around 60 miles apart and the target was engaged at a distance of around 2.5 miles. The basic Kornet ATGM uses laser beam-riding guidance and requires manual control to take it to its target. The air-launched version reportedly also has infrared and TV-guided modes although it’s not clear if these are used for missile guidance or simply to help the operator detect and track targets and the process by which the drone operator initially finds the target remains unknown. A related report from Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti suggests the same missile can also be used from the Forpost and Altius UAVs. A maintainer works on a missile launcher for the Kh-BPLA under the wing of an Orion drone., RUSSIA-1/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The Orion is typically fitted with a turret that mounts electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser target designator to deliver guided weapons against targets on the ground. The footage suggests that a pilot in the ground control station uses these sensors onboard the drone to initially acquire the target and then command a missile launch. The penetrating jet of the missile’s HEAT warhead is visible immediately prior to impacting the drone target., RUSSIA-1/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP More details about the air-launched Kornet missile appear in the RIA Novosti report, which quotes an unnamed source in the military-industrial complex. The source says the missile — designated Kh-BPLA — has completed “dozens of successful tests” from the prototype Ka-52M attack helicopter . The same source attributed a maximum range of 6.2 miles to the missile and said it can destroy both low-flying, low-speed aerial targets as well as armored vehicles. In fact, a version of the Kornet with an anti-aircraft capability already existed. The 9M133FM-3 was developed to provide ground troops and vehicles with a means to defeat UAVs, helicopters, and other low-flying threats and it appears to be this model that has now been adapted for air launch. Previous reports had indicated that a version of the Vikhr-M missile would be tested on the Orion drone, but it’s unclear if those plans have been superseded or if both missiles will be employed from the UAV. Repurposing an ATGM for air-to-air use is not altogether unheard of in Russia, with an earlier iteration of the Vikhr also having been used by the Su-25 attack jet to down an unmanned Tu-16 bomber . This remained purely experimental, however, and the Vikhr was never adopted for service as a Su-25 weapon. An air-to-air version of the Vikhr ATGM shoots a Tu-16 bomber converted as a target drone: As for the rotary-wing target drone used in the test, this appears to be an example of a type developed by CSTS Dinamika, a division of Russia’s Technodinamika Group. This UAV, developed specifically as a target , bears a strong resemblance to the Austrian-made Schiebel S-100 Camcopter and was unveiled last year. So far, the designation of this drone has not been revealed. Three of the rotary-wing target drone UAVs at the exercise range in Crimea., RUSSIA-1/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP In one sequence in the latest Russia-1 report, Maj. Gen. Alexander Novikov, the head of the Russian General Staff’s Office for UAV Development, says the Orion drone can shoot down the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 and other UAVs. The TB2 has been widely heralded as a game-changer in recent conflicts in Syria , Libya , and between Azerbaijan and Armenia . Most significantly, it has also been operated in combat by Ukraine , a country with which Russia has been deeply embroiled in conflict since 2014. It is, therefore, more than just a coincidence that the latest missile test took place in Crimea, an area that Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014 and which has since been the focus of renewed military activity, from amphibious landing drills to anti-ship missile exercises. Russian officials pointing to the specific ability of the Orion to now shoot down TB2 drones seems to be intended as a very clear signal to Ukraine. But it is also just as relevant to potential export customers of the Orion, to counter not only the TB2, which Turkey keeps finding new customers for but also other similar drones, and to more generally provide competition for them on the export market. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wEHXdogxgwM In the past, we have looked more broadly at the significant military potential offered by the Orion UAV, which had previously been used to test air-launched weapons in an air-to-ground role, including during combat trials in Syria in 2018 . However, the launch of air-to-air missiles, or at least dual-role weapons with the ability to hit targets in the air as well as on the ground, seems to further point toward the Orion moving toward operational capability. Until now, the Orion program has had some problems, including rejection of the first examples by the Russian Ministry of Defense due to “additional requirements that were not originally included in the technical specification.” There have also been at least one crash and difficulties in securing a reliable Russian-made powerplant. At the same time, these kinds of capabilities will only make the export-configured Orion-E version even more attractive to foreign customers, especially those who face a threat from enemy UAVs. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wEHXdogxgwM As we have pointed out in the past , there is little in the way of direct U.S. competition to the armed Orion or the TB2, although China does offer a range of similar capabilities for export. In the case of Chinese-made drones, however, there have been high-profile problems relating to these and their serviceability. With a gross weight of around 2,250 pounds and an endurance of up to 24 hours, the Orion is broadly similar to the MQ-1 Predator, sharing a long, straight wing and pusher-propeller propulsion. The U.S. Air Force has retired the MQ-1, and it is no longer in production. Employing a drone to engage low-flying, low-speed drone target is still very much a niche capability, although in the past helicopters have been adopted for this mission by some operators. Israel, in particular, has used its AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to down hostile UAVs , also using Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, the agility and low-speed handling of the rotorcraft making it a good match to intercepting even smaller drones. However, there have only been a few examples of engagements involving drones as the launch platforms for air-to-air missiles in any conflict to date. The U.S. Air Force began work in this direction at least as early as 2003 when it armed MQ-1s with the air-to-air version of the heat-seeking Stinger missile to provide a degree of protection against Iraqi jets. You can read more about that effort here . Since then, the U.S. Air Force has used its MQ-9 Reaper to launch an air-to-air missile, firing an AIM-9X Sidewinder against a maneuvering target during a test in November 2017. Iran, meanwhile, has reportedly used its Karrar UAV as an “interceptor drone” to destroy aerial targets during exercises . While imagery has been released showing the Karrar launching the Azarakhsh missile , which was originally claimed to be a combination anti-tank and short-range surface-to-air weapon, there does not appear to be any conclusive evidence that missiles fired by Karrar drones have actually hit any targets. Otherwise, developments in the field of drones with air-to-air capabilities are increasingly focusing on more sophisticated platforms, like the U.S. Air Force’s loyal wingman-type drones as well as programs like LongShot , which aims to field an aircraft-launched drone equipped with its own air-to-air missiles to engage adversary aircraft. All in all, these developments indicate just how seriously Russia is taking its efforts to arm its new drones with a wide array of ordnance for both air-to-ground and now air-to-air missions. After lagging behind the United States, China, and other countries in developing modern drones of any kind, Moscow seems to be focusing its attention not only on filling niches in terms of size and performance — the Orion and Okhotnik being good examples of this — but also providing novel weapons capabilities for them. It remains to be seen, however, whether these ambitious technologies fulfill their promise. While the Russian military budget may not be enough to sustain all these programs in the long term, it’s possible that some, at least, could win export orders. After all, Russia has an extensive list of existing arms customers, less restrictive export conditions than the United States, and a track record of using creative financing to help secure sales of military equipment.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 23, 2020",Hypersonic Strike Aircraft Capability Is Part Of The Air Force’s Shadowy Project Mayhem,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed new details about its secretive Mayhem hypersonic air vehicle program . Previously it was understood that this program was focused, at least in part, on acquiring testbeds to support work on advanced high-speed jet engines like the ones that have reportedly been in development for proposed hypersonic aircraft such as Lockheed Martin’s SR-72 . The service has now disclosed that it is seeking a modular experimental design that could be configured to carry one of two different kinds of payloads for strike missions, or a sensor package to enable it to conduct “responsive” intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or ISR, sorties. The new information about Mayhem was contained in a contracting document that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) posted online on Dec. 14, 2021. That same document also indicates that the full formal name of the program has changed from “Expendable Hypersonic Multi-Mission Air-Breathing Demonstrator” to “Hypersonic Multi-mission ISR and Strike.” The name “Multi-Mission Cruiser” had been associated with this project in the past, as well. Mayhem, which the Air Force first disclosed the existence of last year, is also part of a larger AFRL effort known as Enabling Technologies for High-Speed Operable Systems (ETHOS). A portion of the new Mayhem-related contracting document with the “Hypersonic Multi-mission ISR and Strike” title that also mentions the broader Enabling Technologies for High-Speed Operable Systems (ETHOS) effort., USAF “The Mayhem Program is focused on delivering a larger class air-breathing hypersonic system capable of executing multiple missions with a standardized payload interface, providing a significant technological advancement and future capability,” the contracting document says. “The system goal is to carry payloads five-times the mass and double the range of current technology capability systems. The standardized payload interface would create multiple opportunities for various payload integration within the same hypersonic system.” The technical description of the Mayhem program as provided in the contracting document that the Air Force Research Laboratory released on Dec. 14, 2021., USAF No information is provided about the “current technology capability systems” that the Mayhem program requirements have been derived from. The document does say that “this requirement will be classified Secret, with the possibility of requiring Top Secret access at later stages of the requirement” and “a program ceiling of $371M is currently anticipated.” While it had been known that the Air Force was interested in the Mayhem air vehicle carrying one of three payloads, no further information had been previously provided about what they might be. This new contracting document identifies them as an “area effect payload,” a “large unitary payload,” and a “Responsive, Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance (ISR)” one. Interestingly, these basic payload descriptions are all labeled as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Though technically unclassified, information determined to be in the CUI category is often redacted in publicly released U.S. government documents. Beyond these three payload categories, no further details are provided about what exactly the Air Force might be interested in. That there is a desire for distinct “area effect” and “large unitary” types strongly suggests that the first one envisions a payload of cluster muntions or something similar, such as a swarm of small drones . An advanced high-explosive fragmentation warhead would also provide an “area effect,” but would be a unitary design. At the same time, “large unitary” might cover larger warheads designed to provide different kinds of effects against single targets, such as deep-penetrating capabilities for use against bunkers and other hardened facilities. Of course, there are just some possibilities, and with the information available now we just can’t say for sure what the exact design of these payloads might be. The ISR package could similarly include any number of different sensors. Information about any other requirements for the Mayhem air vehicle design, beyond that it will be capable of hypersonic flight, defined as any speed above Mach 5, remains scant. The Air Force has previously confirmed that the project is linked to research and development of “advanced scramjet propulsion technologies” and “multi-cycle” jet engine designs. This had appeared to point to work on turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) or dual-mode scramjet engine types. The basic idea behind these kinds of jet engine designs is to get around the fact that scramjets, as well as ramjets , simply do not perform reliably at lower speeds. Coupling them with a more traditional jet turbine would enable an air vehicle to operate reliably in that lower speed range. When applied to a reusable manned or unmanned aircraft, this engine configuration would, at least theoretically, allow for a design that can fly at hypersonic speeds during the midcourse portion of a sortie, but also take off and land like a more traditional plane using existing runway infrastructure. This is something that has long been seen as a holy grail capability for a viable hypersonic aircraft. In the past, Mayhem has been discussed as being adjacent to other U.S. military programs that are pursuing air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapons Concept (HAWC) effort and the Air Force’s Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) project. “Project Mayhem is to look at the next step in what the opportunity space allows relative to hypersonic cruise missile systems,” Michael White, the Principal Director for Hypersonics in the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering for Modernization, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, back in June . “And so if you look at what we’re doing right now, and the sizes that we’re looking at to deliver capability, you get a certain range and a certain payload to that range, and a certain compatibility with the air platforms that we have today.” “Project Mayhem says, OK, what happens — what can we do to build a much bigger system to deliver more effects at longer range?” he continued. “And so really, it’s looking at that kind of evolution of capability that you might get to extend out what you can achieve with a highly efficient air-breathing platform — weapon platform and take advantage of that efficiency but still extend the range to significant — significantly longer ranges than what we’re doing today.” An artist’s conception of a notional air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile., Raytheon At the same time, this talk of a bigger, more robust system capable of carrying various payloads and that uses a more complex engine arrangement can only raise questions about what the design might actually be capable of if it, or a follow-on derivative, were to enter operational service. The word “expendable” is notably absent from the latest contracting document, as well. This is all even more interesting to consider when one remembers the still very curious burst of public discussion about potential future reusable unmanned hypersonic aircraft between 2017 and 2018. Lockheed Martin and Boeing went so far as to put out concept art of national designs, referred to as the SR-72 and Valkyrie , respectively. A rendering of the proposed SR-72., Lockheed Martin An artist’s conception of the Boeing Valkyrie., Boeing Lockheed Martin specifically discussed the potential for the SR-72, the name of which was a deliberate reference to the company’s famous supersonic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane , to be used for strike, as well as ISR missions. There had also been talk about a possible fighter jet-sized demonstrator design to prove out a TBCC engine configuration that the company had been working on with Aerojet Rocketdyne since the mid-2000s. Former CEO Marillyn Hewson had said that such aircraft might cost less than $1 billion , a possible indication of the increasing maturity of the underlying technology. “Scramjet is much more mature and ready to go than I originally thought,” then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Will Roper said in April 2020 . Equipment at Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee that was used in a reportedly record-setting test of a Northrop Grumman scramjet design in 2019., USAF In the last year and a half or so, the Air Force has awarded a number of small contracts to multiple aviation startups pursuing hypersonic or supersonic aircraft designs and advanced engines to go with them. At least officially, these deals have almost all been with an eye toward developing potential high-speed executive transports for the service, but the technology could, of course, have more varied applications. In October, Exosonic, a hypersonic aviation startup that had already secured one contract with the Air Force, issued a press release regarding a new award from the service to help fund the development of an unmanned supersonic demonstrator. In announcing that deal, the company noted that this aircraft could potentially serve as a pilotless mock opponent for training fighter pilots and that it was in discussions with Tactical Air Support , a firm that provides “red air” adversary support services to the U.S. military, about this potential use case. A rendering of Exosonic’s hypersonic unmanned aircraft design, which could serve as a pilotless adversary to help train fighter pilots, among other roles., Exosonic A reusable hypersonic strike and ISR aircraft, particularly an unmanned one, that can operate from existing bases and that has a modular payload capability, could offer distinct benefits in terms of flexibility and responsiveness compared to other aircraft, missiles, and ISR platforms, depending on the exact operational context. “Hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour. … Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades,” Brad Leland, then Lockheed Martin’s Program Manager for Hypersonics, wrote in a pitch for the SR-72 back in 2013. It very much remains to be seen how the Air Force’s Mayhem program will evolve and what, if any, prototype designs it ultimately produces. At the same time, everything we’ve learned so far continues to point to something beyond just another hypersonic missile project.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 29, 2021",Alleged Israeli Airstrike Cratered The Runway At Syria’s Damascus International Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While information is still limited, satellite imagery released by an American satellite imaging firm appears to reveal prominent cratering damage at Damascus International Airport in Syria, seemingly as a result of Israeli airstrikes yesterday. Unconfirmed reports suggest that cruise missiles were launched by Israeli Air Force jets and at least some of these may have been responsible for damaging the runway at the airport. Damascus International has been used in the past to fly in supplies to support Iranian militia and affiliates operating in Syria and Lebanon, including Hezbollah , and has also come under repeated Israeli attack . As is usual for these kinds of instances, Russian sources state that Syrian-operated, Russian-supplied Pantsir-S1 air defense systems shot down seven of the eight missiles launched yesterday. However, a satellite image provided by Capella Space and shared on Twitter by Aurora Intel seems to confirm the presence of three impact craters approximately 2,000 feet apart along the runway. If these missiles were indeed responsible for the runway damage at Damascus International then it’s clear that these Russian claims, once again, do not stack up. According to Rear Adm. Vadim Kulit, deputy head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of Warring Parties in Syria, quoted by Russian state media sources , the Israeli airstrike yesterday resulted in damage to a warehouse and killed one soldier. “On December 16, from 1:51 to 1:59, four Israeli Air Force F-16 tactical fighters from the airspace over the Golan Heights struck with eight cruise missiles at targets near the Damascus International Airport,” Kulit said at a briefing. The Syrian state news agency SANA meanwhile cited an unnamed military source saying, “the Israeli enemy carried out an aerial aggression,” adding that the Israeli missiles were fired from airspace over the Golan Heights. SANA repeated the claim that Syrian air defenses shot down “most” of the cruise missiles. Once again, this is par for the course following any Israeli airstrikes in the country. Currently, the southern part of Damascus International Airport is closed to airline traffic as it undergoes refurbishment. Exactly why this particular runway was targeted is unclear, therefore, especially as the other runway remains active and is reportedly used to host flights bringing materiel to support Iranian military activities in the country. While the apparently precise nature of the air raid would have successfully put an active runway out of action at least until it could be repaired, the fact the targeted runway was already being worked on anyway means the effects will be limited to slowing down the process of refurbishment that’s already underway. Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, second left front, receives his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, center, on his arrival at Damascus International Airport in May 2021., SANA via AP Regardless, Damascus International has been a target for repeated Israeli airstrikes over the years, due to it having been used by Iran for weapons transfers and other support for its proxies operating in Syria and beyond. The area around the southern portion of the airport is where Iranian operations are most active and have borne the brunt of Israeli airstrikes on the airfield in the past. Israeli officials have so far not commented on yesterday’s apparent raid, which is in line with its policy of ambiguity regarding airstrikes in Syria. However, Israel has in the past expressed grave concern about deployments of Iran-backed forces in Syria, including Hezbollah and other Shia militias, and has repeatedly conducted airstrikes in response to this, including targeting weapons depots. At the same time, the Israeli government has made it clear on numerous occasions that it sees Tehran’s growing influence in the Middle East, and especially in Lebanon and Syria, as an existential threat against which it will take action at will. In the past, Israeli Air Force fighter jets have carried out raids both over Syrian territory as well as launching standoff weapons from outside Syrian airspace, frequently over Lebanon. A significant proportion of these attacks have targeted objectives in southwest Syria, which is home to Iranian forces and Shia militias, but other raids have been reported around the cities of Homs and Hama in central Syria, the northern city of Aleppo, and the town of Albu Kamal on the eastern border with Iraq. Israel has also targeted Iranian-linked activities in Lebanon and Iraq as part of the same wider campaign. Earlier this month, Israel carried out strikes on a suspected Iranian arms shipment at the port of Latakia, in western Syria, without causing any casualties. Video of the Israeli airstrike on the port of Latakia on December 7: Meanwhile, in late November , it was reported that two civilians were killed and six soldiers were wounded in Israeli strikes in Homs province. Syrian air defenses were again activated in response to the attack, SANA claiming that several missiles were shot down. Damascus has in the past threatened to respond to Israel Air Force strikes into its territory with its own attacks against Israel, including using Scud ballistic missiles , but so far this has never materialized. The other major power involved in this dynamic is Russia, which, like Iran, has assisted President Bashar al-Assad’s government in regaining control of much of Syria. Typically, however, the Russian military elements in Syria hold back from interfering with Israeli strikes on Iran-linked targets. There is also a process of deconfliction between Israel and Russia, to provide Moscow with advance warning of Israeli Air Force operations. Whether the latest Israeli attacks are part of a new, wider campaign against Iranian-backed forces in Syria, or if the airstrikes are in response to particular intelligence, for example relating to suspected arms shipments, is unclear. Moreover, the fact that Israeli would apparently decide to attack a currently non-operational runway is mysterious, unless it was targeted simply as a means of further frustrating the Assad regime. Overall, however, yesterday’s apparent events at Damascus International provide more evidence of an uptick in the number of strikes carried out on Syrian territory by the Israeli military in recent weeks.

Adam Kehoe and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Jan 20, 2022",Harassment Of Navy Destroyers By Mysterious Drone Swarms Off California Went On For Weeks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this year The War Zone exclusively reported about a series of 2019 incidents that involved unidentified drones stalking US Navy vessels over several nights in the waters off of Southern California. Our initial report also covered the Navy’s investigation into the incidents, which appeared to struggle to identify either the aircraft or their operators. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday later clarified that the aircraft were never identified , and that there have been similar incidents across the service branches and allied militaries. Newly released documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) show that the full scope of these drone incursions was greater than it initially appeared, and they persisted well after the Navy’s investigation was launched. Deck logs indicate that drone sightings continued throughout the month of July 2019 and included events where drone countermeasure teams were called into action. One notable event involved at least three ships observing multiple drones. Uncharacteristically for unclassified deck logs, the details on this event are almost entirely redacted. Among the new documents is the map seen below that details the interactions between a drone (denoted on what appears to be a briefing slide as an unmanned aerial system, or UAS) and a Navy Arleigh Burke class destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton . Map depicts the USS Paul Hamilton’s interactions with an unknown UAS, US Navy via FOIA The map depicts Paul Hamilton making an abrupt right-hand turn while a drone closely follows the ship. The legends and annotations of the map have been redacted under FOIA exemptions that apply to technical data that have military applications. Though the title of the document reads July 17th, the map appears to refer to drone encounters that occurred in the incidents on July 14th and July 15th. Intriguingly, one of the position points of the drone is marked with a star, while others show a dashed line around a given area. It is unclear exactly what these indicate without the map legends, though the star suggests at least one particularly notable event. Our previous coverage indicated that the incident involved multiple contacts that maneuvered around the ships in a highly dynamic way, and there may have been uncertainty about the exact location of the drones at times. The deck logs from the period show that Ship Nautical Or Otherwise Photographic Interpretation and Exploitation (SNOOPIE) teams were deployed frequently during the incidents. SNOOPIE teams consist of sailors specifically trained to enhance situational awareness and to document unknown contacts or other events and objects of interest. It is highly likely that a number of photographs exist of the drones given the work of the SNOOPIE teams and other onboard sensors. The same document providing the map above also contains a reference to a photograph of the drones, which has been completely redacted under the same technical data exemptions. A member of a destroyer’s SNOOPIE team with a video camera in hand, US Navy According to deck logs, the proximity of the drones also led the ships to exercise enhanced “emissions control,” or EMCON, protocols designed to minimize their electronic profile. An extensive analysis by War Zone editor Tyler Rogoway explains that drones could play a useful role in provoking reactions from an adversary as a means to capture highly prized electronic intelligence (ELINT) and sensitive operating procedures. Intriguingly, references to EMCON were not universal throughout the encounters, and do not appear to have been as relevant in the newly released documents. Previously, the majority of available documents suggested that the drone encounters were limited to the evenings of July 15th and July 16th, 2019, with a second, but minor series of events occurring towards the end of the month. New logs show that sightings persisted sporadically throughout the second half of July with another significant event happening in the early hours of July 30th. Indeed, as early as the morning of July 17th, the USS Russell , another Arleigh Burke class destroyer, continued to report drone sightings, as seen in the portion of the log below. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell ., US Navy via FOIA It is very noteworthy that several days later, on the 20th, the USS Russell conducted an initial counter UAS exercise. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy Later in the same day, the Russell conducted another set of counter UAS exercises, this time firing a 5-inch naval gun. Speaking to USNI News , retired Navy officer Thomas Callender explained that 5-inch deck guns have been tested as a counter UAS weapon in the past with limited success, stating “they found that the 5-inch gun took multiple shots to try and hit it because it’s not designed for something slow and small.” Callender’s remarks were in the context of another incident in July 2019 that involved Marines onboard the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Boxer disabling an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz using a vehicle-mounted electronic warfare system .  The logs from this period reflect that several shots were fired in the exercise, including at least one misfire. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy Three days later, another drone was spotted by a SNOOPIE team at an elevation of about 400 feet. Note that in naval parlance, “calling away” refers to sending sailors to their posts. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell, US Navy A little over an hour later, flares were spotted, though the logs do not remark if these were connected to the ongoing drone sighting. Flares are not uncommon in the training areas off Southern California where the ships were operating. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy The following day, a new term is introduced to the logs: “ghostbusters.” A log entry reflects an apparently brief counter UAS exercise lasting about eight minutes. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell, US Navy Though official references are hard to come by, “ghostbuster” is a term sometimes used to refer to lower-end counter UAS devices that look similar to rifles. A woman test-fires the anti-drone gun known as the DroneDefender. , Battelle These anti-drone countermeasures are increasingly being used by security forces around the world . They operate by using highly-directional radiofrequency jammers designed to disrupt communications between drones and their operators. One key limitation of these devices is that they can only disable drones that are directly controlled by a human operator. Autonomous systems are far more resilient against such countermeasures. Beyond that, their overall effectiveness varies heavily by type and circumstance. Aside from these limitations, they are relatively portable and easily fielded. It is not perfectly clear if the Russell had this equipment onboard previously, or if “ghostbuster” devices were brought onboard in reaction to the earlier drone incidents. If so, they would have been among the simplest counter-drone devices to field given their independent man-portable deployability. Our previous reporting did not show any indication of the use of these devices in the earlier incidents, and references to them appear shortly after the counter-UAS exercise, heavily suggesting they may have been introduced in response to the incursions. We are not aware of these systems being widely fielded on surface ships at the time, especially those operating in home waters. Also, only the USS Russell reported the use of “ghostbusters” in its logs. After a relatively quiet period, another incident occurred in the very early hours of July 30th. A SNOOPIE team was activated and “ghostbusters” were called for shortly afterwards. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy What follows are uncharacteristically redacted logs. As with the map of the drone movements earlier in this story, the exemptions pertain to technical military data. In the hundreds of pages of ship logs reviewed by us about this matter, these are the first to contain significant redactions and the only ones to reference this particular exemption. Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy By 3:00 AM on July 30, the pattern of redaction ends. In the same timeframe, at least two other ships nearby noted drone or UAV activity. As previously reported, the USS Kidd, another Arleigh Burke class destroyer involved in these incidents , deployed its own SNOOPIE team for UAVs at 2:16 AM that day. The log later notes that the SNOOPIE team was recalled by 3:27 AM. Excerpt from the log of the USS Kidd , US Navy Logs from the USS Paul Hamilton also reflect multiple drones spotted off the ship, and their own SNOOPIE team activated around 3:30 AM on July 30. Excerpt from the log of the USS Paul Hamilton , US Navy Later in the morning on the same day, the Russell again engaged its SNOOPIE team and the “ghostbusters.” Excerpt from the log of the USS Russell , US Navy This log entry also has a reference to “SCAT,” which likely stands for Small Craft Action Team. Speaking to Business Insider last year, Navy Lt. J. G. Frank Smeeks, an anti-terrorism officer, explained that “SCAT is a team consisting of crew-served weapons machine gun operators that provide 360-degree coverage of the ship, an anti-terrorism tactical watch officer and a gunnery liaison officer. They are called away as a pre-planned response to threats the ship may face like a small boat attack or low, slow flyer.” Logs from another nearby ship, the USS Bunker Hill , also indicate that they manned their own SNOOPIE team and SCAT in the same timeframe. The Bunker Hill logs are unclear if the SNOOPIE team was deployed in response to a drone sighting. The simultaneous use of three teams designed for quick reactions to potential threats suggests a high level of alarm well into the morning. USS America conducts small craft attack team drills, US Navy In this same general time period, it appears that the USS Russell was visited by an unnamed admiral. Deck logs record an admiral arriving on July 22, just prior to the implementation of counter UAS training exercises and the start of references to “ghostbusters” on the morning of July 24. Logs also remark about an admiral casting off on July 31, but there are few other indicators what the purpose of the visit may have been or if it had any connection to the UAS incidents. Cumulatively, these records show a sustained, but an intermittent pattern of drone sightings throughout the month of July by Navy ships operating off Southern California. These events seemed to have spurred additional training and the rapid deployment of unique capabilities like the “ghostbuster” counter-UAS equipment. It remains unknown what impact, if any, this training and equipment had on deterring drone operations. At least three ships reported sighting drones in the very early hours of July 30th, with unusual and extensive redactions in the logs of the USS Russell, but we do not know what happened the next day, or in the weeks that followed. It is also noteworthy that these events occurred well after Navy investigators sought to “correlate or rule out operations” with Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) based in San Diego. Indeed, an investigation began immediately after the initial events on July 16th, with information on the incidents being routed to the Chief of Naval Operations as early as July 18th. Given the progress of the investigation, more prosaic causes like errant US aircraft or civilian activity had already been examined. Whatever the outcome of the July 30th event, it was likely closely scrutinized by Navy leadership. The lack of concrete identification of the aircraft involved also led to widespread public speculation earlier this year. Leaked photos and videos said to pertain to the July 15th and 16th incident were released this summer by filmmaker Jeremy Corbell . The materials consisted of footage of radar screens showing multiple unknown contacts, video of an object apparently falling into the ocean, and a brief video of a triangular-shaped light flying over the deck of a ship. The apparent triangular shape of the object has been strongly debated , as many have posited it was the result of a common optical artifact. A briefing slide depicts several pictures of a “seemingly triangular” shape recorded by the Russell , Jeremy Corbell The Department of Defense was quick to partially authenticate the material, acknowledging that the videos were taken by Navy personnel. However, to date, the Pentagon has not provided any details that corroborate the location or timeframe of the footage or any clarification on what the objects were. Corbell maintains that the videos depict extraordinarily complex vehicles capable of “transmedium” travel, or the ability to traverse both water and the atmosphere with ease. Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday explained in a press briefing earlier this year that while the Navy had not positively identified the aircraft, there were no indications they were extraterrestrial in nature. There has been significant overlap in the discussion of the mounting threat from lower-end drones and resurgent interest in UFOs in recent years. That overlap is conspicuous in the recent National Defense Authorization Act language , which authorizes an expansive approach to the Pentagon’s study of UFOs. The language, introduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, creates a requirement for conducting “field investigations,” as well as new mandates to scientifically examine UFO reports. An amended version of Gillibrand’s proposal was ultimately adopted in the NDAA and awaits President Biden’s signature. While many have focused on otherworldly explanations for UFO sightings, Senator Gillibrand told Politico that the rationale for her interest encompassed conventional and emerging technology and not only the “unknown.” She explained, “you’re talking about drone technology, you’re talking about balloon technology, you’re talking about other aerial phenomena, and then you’re talking about the unknown.” The urgency surrounding the drone issue has been a growing focus among defense policymakers as encounters with both civilian and military aircraft have become widespread. In the last five years the Federal Aviation Administration has gathered approximately ten thousand drone incident reports. We have made many of these reports available in an interactive tool that maps the location and descriptions of the incident. Far from being only a domestic issue, drones have also become a matter of grave concern for military leaders. Earlier this year Marine General Kenneth McKenzie Jr. said in a speech to the Middle East Institute that “the growing threat posed by these systems coupled with our lack of dependable, networked capabilities to counter them is the most concerning tactical development since the rise of the improvised explosive device in Iraq.” McKenzie also explained that drones “provide adversaries the operational ability to surveil and target U.S. and partner facilities while affording plausible deniability and a disproportionate return on the investment, all in our adversaries’ favor.” In the case of the 2019 Southern California incidents, several of these factors appear to be at work. The newly released map clarifies just how closely drones were shadowing Navy ships, likely affording opportunities to gather a variety of valuable intelligence. The lack of positive attribution of the aircraft even today speaks to McKenzie’s comments about plausible deniability and disproportionate return. Questions also linger surrounding “dependable, networked capabilities” and countermeasures. For now, it remains unknown if the “ghostbuster” devices and additional counter-UAS training were sufficient to halt the incursions. A highly pertinent question now is when exactly did they end, and how widespread similar incidents have been elsewhere? The timing of training and potential deployment of counter-UAS capabilities in the weeks after the events of July 15th and 16th also points to the Navy believing these were unidentified drones, not fantastic craft with out-of-this-world abilities. This appears consistent with our previous reporting, which found that the Navy had investigated its own drone flights and questioned civilians known to operate drones in that area. Additionally, countless deck log entries refer to the aircraft not only as UAS or UAV, but also plainly as drones. Finally, asked about our reporting, the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday himself stated there was no indication that the aircraft were extraterrestrial. Still, since they remain unidentified, we can’t say for certain exactly what they were or who they belonged to. We are still far from a full answer. These new documents suggest several avenues for further inquiry, and we expect new information to develop. As we and our expert sources continue to analyze the documents some inferences are bound to change. References to the colorful term “ghostbuster” appear to be new to this story, and we are currently pursuing additional records to clarify exactly what this entailed and what happened in subsequent days and weeks.

Brian O'Rourke,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",SpaceX Rocket Will Make a Highly Unusual Flight Along California’s Coast Overnight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. SpaceX plans to launch a package of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Saturday. The Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to launch to low-Earth orbit from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) at 1:24 AM Pacific Standard Time, though launch schedules often change. The launch might be considered unremarkable — SpaceX has launched more than 1,800 Starlink satellites so far, according to Space.com — but for the fact that its scheduled flight plan will have the rocket travel shortly over land then and along the California Coast before making a small dogleg turn to the east, an unusual maneuver. This is reportedly the first time a SpaceX launch from Vandenberg will follow such a path, and it is bound to give Southern Californians an unprecedented light show . Temporary flight restrictions put in place show a reserved slice of airspace that runs southeast from Vandenberg roughly parallel to California’s Highway 1. This would appear to take the rocket out over the Southern California Bight and the Channel Islands. The website Teslarati — which describes itself as “a California-based multi-platform media company and leading lifestyle brand with a focus on Tesla, SpaceX, and ventures affiliated with Elon Musk” — explains that the launch will place the satellites in orbit at an inclination of 53.22 degrees. NASA defines orbital inclination as a measure of the angle formed between the equator and the plane of the object’s orbit when viewed from the side, so that the plane appears as a line. Teslarati reports that previous launches from Vandeberg have not been able “to regularly launch to inclinations lower than approximately 56 degrees.” A smaller inclination keeps an orbit closer to the equator and, therefore, potentially in view of desired ground stations longer. In this case, the website notes that SpaceX gave Celestrak information that suggests the Falcon 9 rocket will make a slight left turn after launch — just a few degrees — to achieve an orbit with the shallower inclination. Shallower is a relative term, of course, as 53 degrees is almost, but not quite, a polar orbit — which is defined as an orbital inclination from 60 to 90 degrees, according to the European Space Agency . Starlink is a SpaceX-operated constellation of satellites connected by a mesh-like network of data links that provides internet connections to remote areas and other services. SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 from Vandenberg last month, and the San Luis Obispo Tribune reports that launches from the base usually provide the Central Coast with “a spectacle.” Space launches typically avoid populated areas as much as possible for as long as possible while in the atmosphere, often heading straight out over deep water. This launch’s unusual flight path may make the show more spectacular than most. Current weather forecasts for Vandeberg during the launch time are for clear skies and temperatures in the upper 30s — great skywatching weather. SpaceX reports it could also launch on Sunday, December 19, at 1:03 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST) if the first launch is postponed. A group of Starlink satellites about to be released into orbit., Wikimedia SpaceX rockets are designed to be reusable, and the company says the Falcon 9 first-stage booster being used for this weekend’s shot “previously launched Dragon’s first crew demonstration mission, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission, SXM-7, and seven Starlink missions.” If all goes according to plan, this booster will land on a SpaceX drone barge — dubbed “Of Course I Still Love You” — in the Pacific Ocean. The company will stream a live webcast of this mission that will begin about 15 minutes prior to liftoff.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 21, 2021",Special Operations C-130 Hits Target With A ‘Rapid Dragon’ Pallet-Dropped Cruise Missile (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force says it has conducted the first successful end-to-end test of its Rapid Dragon air-launched palletized munitions concept. An MC-130J Commando II special operations transport released an unspecified live cruise missile using the prototype system, which subsequently hit a target floating in the Gulf of Mexico. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is leading the Rapid Dragon program through its Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation (SDPE) office, announced the completion of this test today. The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Air Force’s Standoff Munitions Application Center, and the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center-Dahlgren Division (NSWC-Dahlgren), as well as private contractors Lockheed Martin, Systima Technologies, Safran Electronics & Defense, Parachutes USA, and R4 Integration, Inc., were also involved in this demonstration. The video below shows a montage of earlier Rapid Dragon flight testing. “During the December test, an MC-130J flown by an Air Force Special Operations Command operational flight crew, received new targeting data while in flight which was then routed to the cruise missile flight test vehicle (FTV),” according to an Air Force release. “The aircraft agnostic Battle Management System’s inflight receipt and upload of the new targeting data into the FTV was a first-time achievement with a live cruise missile.” “Once inside the drop zone over the Gulf of Mexico, the MC-130J aircrew airdropped a four-cell Rapid Dragon deployment system containing the FTV and three mass simulants, which were sequentially released from the palletized deployment box while under parachute,” the release continued. “Safe separation from the deployment box and weapon deconfliction was demonstrated using an unconventional deployment method (nose-down vertical orientation). Immediately after the vertical release, the FTV deployed its wings and tail, achieved aerodynamic control, ignited its engine, performed a powered pull-up maneuver, and proceeded toward its newly assigned target. The cruise missile successfully destroyed its target upon impact.” It is not clear why, but the Air Force has not yet disclosed what actual “current inventory cruise missile armed with a live warhead” it employed this test. Previous tests have involved surrogates meant to represent variants of the stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family, which includes the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), as well as a novel design called the Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range, or CLEAVER . It’s also unclear what the actual target was, beyond that it was afloat in the Gulf of Mexico. The Air Force provided no details, but Lockheed Martin described it as a “vessel.” This might point to the use of a LRASM, which would also mean this test has demonstrated the ability to employ the Rapid Dragon system in an anti-ship role, a general area of growing interest to the Air Force as well as the rest of the U.S. military . It has certainly been widely reported in the past that a JASSM variant of some kind would be used for live-firing testing as part of Rapid Dragon. Pictures the Air Force released of a test in November that involved the release of an actual cruise missile, albeit one without an engine or a warhead, from this palletized munitions system clearly showed that it was a missile from the JASSM family. Concept art the service has released of this system has depicted it loaded with JASSM-type missiles, as have models of it that have been displayed publicly. An official model of the Rapid Dragon air-launched palletized munitions system., Joseph Trevithick The core idea behind the Rapid Dragon concept is the development of a roll-on/roll-off package to transform various types of airlifters into additional strike platforms, as required. This would give the Air Force a potentially more cost-effective and scalable way to quickly increase its overall stand-off strike capacity, especially during a future major conflict, such as one against China or Russia. The palletized launcher could also be configured to carry other types of munitions or payloads, such as swarms of small drones , as well. Questions have been raised about how viable all of this might be given that U.S. Air Force airlifters would likely be in high demand to perform their primary missions during any similar conflict scenario. You can read more about the overall concept of operations envisioned for this system, and the potential pitfalls, here . “The program name is derived from a thousand-year-old Chinese military designed crossbow catapult that launched multiple crossbow bolts with the pull of a single trigger, raining destruction down on armies from tremendous ranges,” the Air Force’s release regarding this latest test disclosed, for what appears to be the first time. “These lethal devices were called Ji Long Che —Rapid Dragon Carts. Today, the Rapid Dragon concept is changing the game again, this time as an airborne delivery system for U.S. Air Force weapons. And like its namesake, these palletized munitions promise to unleash mighty salvos en masse on distant adversaries.” An illustration of a triple bed crossbow, a static multi-round design that first emerged in China around the 4th century BC. Carriage or cart-mounted designs, referred to in contemporary sources as Ji Long Che , or Rapid Dragon Carts, are understood to have appeared around the same general time., Yprpyqp via Wikimedia AFRL says that this latest test over the Gulf of Mexico marks the culmination of the current Rapid Dragon test campaign, which started two years ago, but says that it already is planning to conduct another end-to-end live-fire flight test using a C-17A Globemaster III aircraft next year. Air Mobility Command (AMC) C-17As , as well as AFSOC EC-130J Super Js , have been used in previous Rapid Dragon testing. “Rapid Dragon was able to accelerate development by building a broad and strong team. We were committed to a ’test often/learn-fast’ culture, dedicated to experimenting frequently and taking calculated risks,” Dr. Dean Evans, SDPE’s Rapid Dragon Program Manager, said in a statement. “Collaboration from the onset streamlined the process and accelerated development, involving groups from the program inception that are not normally included at the very early stages, and that has made all the difference.” With the successful completion of the current round of Rapid Dragon testing and plans to continue this work in the coming year, the Air Force looks set to keep pushing this concept toward an operational capability, one that could expand its long-range strike options in any future contingency. Update 12/17/2021: The U.S. Air Force has finally released some pictures, seen below, from this latest Rapid Dragon test, showing the palletized munitions being loaded onto the MC-130J. It is still not possible to tell exactly what type of missile was launched, but we can now clearly see that it was a member of the JASSM family.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 24, 2022",Ukraine Once Had The World’s Largest Tu-160 Blackjack Bomber Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Tupolev Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bomber, which first took to the air 40 years ago tomorrow, is an impressive symbol of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation force, a Cold War-era design that’s now being modernized and is back in production in updated form . What’s less well known is that, at one time, the vast majority of the Tu-160 force was not in Russian hands. Instead, it belonged to Ukraine, a country whose relationship with Moscow has steadily deteriorated since it gained independence from the Soviet Union. As the last strategic bomber to be introduced during the Cold War era, the variable-geometry Tu-160 was planned as the spearhead of the separate Long-Range Aviation branch within the Soviet Air Force, and the most prestigious. It had the task of delivering nuclear missiles against high-profile NATO targets if a conflict were to break out. The four-engine bomber can hit a maximum speed of 1,243 miles per hour and can fly over 7,500 miles without in-flight refueling while carrying a payload of six cruise missiles, while a maximum of 12 missiles is also possible. A Tu-160 launches from Pryluky in 1996, during one of the rare flights made by the type in Ukrainian Air Force service.  , Igor Bubin/Wikimedia Commons The Tu-160 program dates back to 1967, with a competition for a long-range supersonic bomber that would be armed with supersonic strategic missiles . Inspired by developments in the United States , the decision was eventually made to equip it with subsonic air-launched cruise missiles. The first prototype Blackjack, known as 70-1, took to the air on December 18, 1981, and the first production aircraft was flown in October 1984. This was followed by initial deliveries of two aircraft to a Long-Range Aviation unit in April 1987. This unit, the 184th Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment, was located in Pryluky, Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union, which would turn out to be problematic. All production aircraft came off the line at the factory in Kazan in Russia. As the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, the Pryluky regiment had two squadrons of Tu-160s, for a total of 19 aircraft. These were now in the hands of independent Ukraine, together with their nuclear armament. These aircraft were soon repainted in Ukrainian Air Force markings, as seen in the photo at the top of this article, but the newly independent country had no use for a strategic bomber force and no plans to field any kind of nuclear deterrent. With the demise of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had been left with around a third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, which, as well as bombers and their munitions, included silo-based SS-19 and SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), for a total of around 1,700 warheads. In 1994 Ukraine agreed to destroy the weapons and join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Moreover, Ukraine lacked the funds to fly its Blackjacks regularly. Without the required technical support, spare parts, and fuel, the Ukrainian Tu-160s rapidly became dormant. A satellite photo of Pryluky Air Base dated 2020. The base has been abandoned since the Tu-160 fleet was removed., Google Earth In Russia, meanwhile, production of the Blackjack continued, at a modest tempo, and in the early 1990s, six more Tu-160s were delivered to the Long-Range Aviation unit at Engels, near Saratov in the southwest Volga region. Nevertheless, the Russian fleet remained much smaller. By 1999, the Long-Range Aviation branch, now part of the Russian Air Force, was at perhaps its lowest point. As well as having just half-a-dozen Tu-160s available, flying hours were slashed to just over 20 per year for each crew member. Long-distance ‘patrol’ missions by Blackjacks, as well as Tu-22M3 and Tu-95MS aircraft, had become a rare occurrence. Reportedly, it was the NATO Allied Force bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999 that prompted Moscow to address its bomber shortcomings. Earlier talks about Moscow buying the Tu-160s from Ukraine had broken down amid disagreements over price and in January 1999 Ukraine had scrapped a first Tu-160.

A proponent of nuclear arms reduction in Europe, Lugar was in Ukraine on a weapons inspection trip., Office of Senator Richard Lugar Finally, in October 1999, an agreement was signed in Yalta, in Crimea — then still Ukrainian territory — under which Russia purchased eight Tu-160s from Ukraine, finally giving Moscow control of the majority of the aircraft. Of the 19 Ukrainian Tu-160s, the eight judged to be in the best condition were prepared for transfer to Russia, while another 10 were scrapped.

This compared with 22 Tu-95MS in Russia and 40 more in newly independent Kazakhstan. The Kazakh Bears were transferred to Russia in exchange for tactical aircraft that went in the other direction. Meanwhile, the three most modern Ukrainian Tu-95MS were sold to Russia as part of the Tu-160 deal, the remainder being scrapped.

Equally importantly, the Kremlin had also secured 575 Kh-55SM nuclear-armed cruise missiles from Ukraine — weapons that arm both the Tu-160 and Tu-95MS — in exchange for debt relief related to the supply of Russian gas.

In the meantime, the demand for Tu-160s was such that a former Tupolev trials aircraft was also refurbished and handed over to the Russian Air Force in a operational configuration.

This example is named Valentin Bliznyuk after one of the designers who worked on the Blackjack program., Dmitriy Pichugin/Wikimedia Commons The Tu-160’s Ukrainian interlude was quickly forgotten, as the Blackjack established itself in Russian service and the bombers — now wearing the names of Russian heroes, both mythic and military — began to fly more long-range missions as part of a rejuvenated strategic flying branch. The protracted path to getting meaningful numbers of Tu-160s into Russian service meant it wasn’t until December 2005 that the type was actually officially commissioned into frontline service. The Russian Aerospace Force, or VKS, as the Russian Air Force was renamed in 2015, is today a proud operator of the Tu-160. The revived Blackjack fleet has seen combat during Moscow’s campaign in Syria and made high-profile visits to South Africa and Venezuela. https://youtube.com/watch?v=I4IKAqeEzgw As well as introducing new armament, including stealthier and conventionally armed cruise missiles, there are greater ambitions for the Tu-160. As you can read about in detail here , Russia has been conducting a mid-life upgrade program for its Tu-160s, adding new mission systems and avionics. A first “deeply modernized” Tu-160M based on an aircraft from the original production series performed its maiden flight in February 2020. It was powered by new-production NK-32-02 engines, the most powerful combat aircraft engine on earth , which replace the NK-32s used in the original production aircraft. At the same time, work is underway to resume production of the Blackjack, to help bolster the bomber fleet pending the possible arrival of a new-generation successor, under the secretive — and delayed — PAK DA program . The new-build aircraft were once to be designated Tu-160M2 but will now also be known as Tu-160Ms. Plans call for up at least 50 new-build Tu-160Ms to remain in service until the 2050s or even the 2060s. Late last year it was reported that the first of the next batch of new-build Tu-160Ms was expected to fly in the fourth quarter of 2021, but so far there have been no signs of preparations. With the continued resurgence of Long-Range Aviation, ongoing Blackjack upgrades, and new production plans, the 40th anniversary of the Tu-160 sees the strategic bomber in good shape. Meanwhile, current tensions between Russia and Ukraine mean that a similar kind of transfer of military assets from one country to the other is now unthinkable. The years since the sale of the Tu-160s have seen Moscow’s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and active support of ostensibly local ‘separatist’ groups in eastern Ukraine. The Tu-160’s interlude with the Ukrainian Air Force now seems an ever more bizarre throwback to a very different period in history.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 21, 2021",The Navy’s $9B Stealthy Super Destroyer Is Covered In Rust,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s first of just three DDG-1000 destroyers , USS Zumwalt , continues its testing and training work off Southern California. The ship, which was commissioned five years ago, has been coming and going from San Diego Bay regularly for years now. The second ship in this small class of highly advanced warships, USS Michael Mansoor (DDG-1001), has also joined Zumwalt in San Diego for its own outfitting and trials. It is hoped that Zumwalt will be able to deploy in the not-so-distant future, but the futuristic warship looked less than gleaming recently, with some of its radar-absorbent tiles deeply discolored and rust streaking down its convex tumblehome hull . Images taken by @CRJ1321 that were posted by our friend @Warshipcam show the ship looking unlike its usually relatively pristine self: CRJ1321 via @Warshipcam CRJ1321 via @Warshipcam CRJ1321 via @Warshipcam The rusty look of the Navy’s super destroyer caught a ton of attention on social media, with various defense commentators posting strong opinions about the look of the ship and the Navy’s ‘running rust’ practices. Here is a sample: This is a well-established issue that is getting worse, not better, but usually, it is found on ships that have been deployed for long periods of time, executing high tempo operations, not those that spend the vast majority of their time tied up to the pier at one of the Navy’s most well-equipped harbors. The ‘running rust’ issue is quite contentious, with some who say as long as the ship functions, it shouldn’t be a major issue, while others claim it is a major embarrassment and indicative of troubling systemic issues within the Navy . One excuse for the ship looking like this could be that it was designed around a minimal manning concept. What this means is that even though DDG-1000 is far larger displacement-wise than an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, its crew complement is just over half the size, at around 175 people, and that is when it is fully staffed for combat operations. While automation can help reduce the need for some tasks, corrosion control is still very much a job that’s done with sweat and elbow grease and the DDG-1000s have a lot of surface area to keep up. Zumwalt class crews also have to deal with low-observable coatings on areas of the ship that are less straightforward to maintain than normal surface corrosion found of other ships in the fleet. That being said, Zumwalt and Michael Monsoor were built with composite deckhouses that are supposed to lessen corrosion. Their sister ship, USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002), has a deckhouse made of steel . As for when Zumwalt will be fully ready for action remains unclear, although it should be reaching initial operational capability anytime now. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated the following in its most recent annual assessment of major US military acquisition programs: As of September 2020, the Navy plans to request $169 million to install its four new systems on at least one or more DDG 1000 ships and would need to request further funding to complete the remaining ships’ systems. Though the Navy plans to fully mature these technologies by ship integration, the integration will not occur until several years after the Navy plans to achieve initial operational capability in December 2021. As a result, the DDG 1000 class ships will remain incomplete and incapable of performing their planned mission until at least 2025. We have reached out to the Navy to get their take on the Zunwalt’s current condition, but for a ship that has been hugely expensive and immensely controversial , running around looking like this is bound to result in unfortunate optics. That is unfortunate because it could eclipse some awesome accomplishments that could be occurring as the ship moves towards some type of initial deployment. UPDATE: Here is the Navy’s response to our inquiry: USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000) returned to homeport Thursday, Dec. 9, after the completion of advanced degaussing testing. For the Surface Force, preservation is a constant battle against corrosion. The harsh environment in which we operate degrades our ships, and our Sailors work hard to address corrosion along with all the maintenance and crew training required to sustain our Navy’s warfighting readiness.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 2, 2020",Airbus Just Delivered The Last A380 Super Jumbo Jet (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The last example of the Airbus A380, the world’s biggest airliner in terms of passenger capacity, has been handed over to its customer, ending a production run that fell well short of the hopes pinned on the ‘Super Jumbo.’ In the end, changing requirements in the airline industry brought the manufacture of the A380 to a premature end with 251 aircraft completed. That’s just one more than the total production run for Lockheed’s L-1011 TriStar . This afternoon, the last production A380, known to Airbus as MSN 272, took off from the manufacturer’s facility in Hamburg, Germany, where it had been painted and finished out, and then headed for its customer, the Dubai-based carrier Emirates. The departure was without fanfare, with Airbus deciding against a formal event, officially due to COVID-19, but likely also due to the company being unwilling to highlight the failings of this ambitious project. Since the program was formally launched in December 2000, the A380 has been all about superlatives. The four-engine behemoth is over 238 feet long, with a wingspan of 262 feet, and can lift off at a weight of roughly 634 tons. The A380 was offered to customers with seating for up to 853 passengers across its two decks, compared to 410 in a three-class layout for Boeing’s 747-8 Intercontinental . However, most airlines opted for more modest capacity, with a 545-seat, four-class arrangement. A380 MSN 272 alongside another Emirates Super Jumbo at the Airbus facility in Hamburg., Airbus First flown in Toulouse in April 2005, the A380 began commercial services with Singapore Airlines in October 2007. By the time production came to an end this year, the Super Jumbo had been ordered by 14 customers, of which Emirates is the biggest by a considerable margin, owning roughly half of all the jets produced. Nevertheless, the total fell well short of expectations, Airbus having once hoped to sell 1,200 examples. Along the way, the A380 has won plaudits for its passenger experience. For the average passenger, the airliner’s size offers a more comfortable experience, while the well-heeled traveler can even enjoy the luxury of the famous first-class ‘Apartment’ suites found on Etihad’s jets. Etihad and Emirates are the United Arab Emirates’ two flag carriers. Flight crew, too, have praised the A380 for its flying qualities. “Airbus have managed to engineer the A380 so that it feels just like a much smaller plane like the A320,” former A380 captain Alex Scerri told BBC News . “It’s remarkably nimble, and it really doesn’t feel like a 600-tonne aircraft.” But the business case that was supposed to underpin the A380 project was less successful. Before 9/11, it was confidently predicted that the growth in air transport would see the pressure on the bigger airport hubs continue to increase. To cope with this pressure, the Airbus solution was to provide an airliner with a much bigger capacity, thereby cutting the number of flights required over the same routes. Despite its size, the A380 is able to use around 400 airports worldwide, but the basic model was always a hub-and-spoke approach, with the Super Jumbo servicing the bigger airports, while smaller airliners operated on connecting flights. Things worked out differently, though. Instead, commercial air transport began to be dominated by efficient twin-engine airliners, smaller than the A380 or 747, but able to fly very long distances more cheaply. Aided by advances in engine technology, composite construction, and aerodynamics, airliners like the long-range versions of the 777, and later the cutting-edge 787 Dreamliner and A350, proved to be much more popular, not least due to the fact they were cheaper to acquire and operate compared to the giant Airbus. A trio of Airbus’ widebody aircraft — an A330, A350 XWB, and A380 – fly in formation., Airbus Delays in actually getting the A380 to customers also dented the program’s prospects. Once it was available, it was hamstrung by older-generation engines and construction materials that made it look increasingly obsolescent. By the time that deliveries of the A380 had begun, most airlines were looking forward to the 787 Dreamliner and A350 instead, with these advanced jets offering carriers the flexibility of being able to operate on less-dense routes between smaller airports, while still making money, as well as reaching more distant destinations. In 2019, Airbus announced plans to wind up A380 production by the end of 2021. Last year, Boeing also confirmed plans to cease production of the venerable 747, the very aircraft the A380 had been drafted to beat. Of the two, the U.S. design will be the clear winner, with more than 1,550 examples of that aircraft having being built, including multiple different variants, over a period of more than five decades. An Airbus infographic from March 2017, around two years before the company announced plans to end production., Airbus Ultimately, the $25 billion invested in the development of the A380 did not pay off. On the way, however, Airbus learned valuable lessons, not least in terms of bringing together major components from production sites across Europe, most of which had to be transported by road and by ship, being too large for the company’s bespoke A330-based Beluga XL freighters. “Airbus would never have been able to reach its current leadership position without this aircraft program,” the company said in a recent statement . “It has made it possible to compete with others’ competitors by offering a full range of products.” A380 MSN 272 in March 2021, soon after its arrival in Hamburg., Airbus While a commercial disappointment for the manufacturer, most of the airlines that bought the A380 have stuck with it, for now at least. Some of these carriers continue to get good value from it. Emirates, for example, generated 85 percent of its pre-pandemic profits through A380 operations. Of the original A380 operators, Air France and Lufthansa, are two high-profile carriers who have phased out the type. However, that still leaves Asiana, British Airways, China Southern, Emirates, Etihad, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and ANA. For operators like Emirates, which has ordered 123 examples, the A380 remains a viable proposition for its extensive network of high-density, long-haul routes. Rather than being part of a predicted revolution in air transport, the Super Jumbo has instead ended up filling niche roles in the industry. The most striking example is perhaps Emirates’ use of the A380 on the world’s shortest scheduled service for the type, a distance of just 217 miles from Dubai to Muscat in Oman, in a time of just less than an hour. Still, while the A380 has been fundamental to the Emirates success story, it and other operators grounded some or all of their fleets amid the downturn in the airline industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven of the Super Jumbos, still nearly new in airliner terms, were even sent for scrapping . The fact that no buyers could be found for the second-hand aircraft demonstrates to what degree the industry has changed since the A380 appeared. With Emirates at least, the immediate future of the A380 looks secure, with plans for the airline to continue flying the Super Jumbo into the mid-2030s, at least. By global airliner standards, the total A380 fleet is small, making sustainment a potential issue, but Emirates has signed an agreement with maintenance provider Spairliners to secure a supply of spares for its aircraft. Still, the airline has already identified the Boeing 777X as a replacement for at least some of its Super Jumbos. “With the 777X gradually slipping in to replace the A380s that eventually go retire, we will have a leaner, very fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly (not that there isn’t a moment) but a network that will probably be 30% larger, in terms of cities, than it is today,” Emirates’ President Tim Clark said earlier this year. Emirates is one of the airlines meanwhile in the process of refurbishing its A380 cabins for continued service, together with Singapore Airlines, and Qantas. Now that production had ended, however, it’s inevitably the beginning of the end, with a gradual drawdown of the global A380 fleet. The current climate suggests that the days of the super-sized airliner are numbered. By the same token, however, the A380 story demonstrates just how quickly things can change in the commercial aviation marketplace. With that in mind, it’s possible we could see a return of Super Jumbo concepts in the future, although that is would be very unlikely. Update, December 17: One of the biggest proponents of the A380, the president of Emirates, Tim Clark, has gone on record to say that he is “convinced that in the fullness of time and with the benefit of rapidly advancing technologies in aerospace, there will be a place for a new, environmentally friendly aircraft of this size.” As well as heaping more praise on the A380, Clark observed that a future Super Jumbo would likely still be required at some point to address the predicted future growth in commercial air transport.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 25, 2021",British Typhoon Fighter Downed A Drone Over Syria For Its First Air-To-Air Kill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has confirmed that a Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon FGR4 fighter jet shot down a hostile drone over Syria earlier this week, in what is the first confirmed air-to-air engagement for this type in British service. The event was also the first time that the RAF has fired an air-to-air missile during Operation Shader , the British contribution to the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in the Middle East. It is seemingly also the first time since the late 1940s that an RAF pilot, flying an RAF plane, has downed an enemy aircraft of any kind in aerial combat. While details so far are limited, British authorities have confirmed that the Typhoon downed a “small hostile drone” on December 14 and that this unmanned aerial vehicle was determined to have posed a threat to coalition forces in the area. The drone activity had initially been detected over the coalition base of At Tanf in Syria and RAF Typhoons conducting routine patrols in the area were tasked to investigate. The drone, of a type so far not identified, was engaged once it became clear that it was a threat, although it’s unclear if it was armed. An RAF Typhoon FGR4 during Operation Shader., CROWN COPYRIGHT “This strike is an impressive demonstration of the RAF’s ability to take out hostile targets in the air which pose a threat to our forces,” said the U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in a statement . “We continue to do everything we can alongside our Coalition partners to stamp out the terrorist threat and protect our personnel and our partners.” Regardless, this British aerial engagement is significant for a number of firsts. It is especially notable that the drone kill was achieved using an infrared-guided MBDA Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or ASRAAM , which is not known to have been used in combat before now. Outside the RAF, the only other ASRAAM operator is Australia. The ASRAAM will have required an infrared signature to engage the drone, but it’s known for having a longer range than equivalent heat-seeking missiles such as the AIM-9X Sidewinder . “Despite the small size of the drone making it a very challenging target, it was successfully shot down using an ASRAAM and the threat eliminated,” the defense ministry confirmed. RAF Typhoon FGR4s carrying ASRAAM missiles on the outer underwing pylons., CROWN COPYRIGHT Also significant is the fact that the incident took place near At Tanf, located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders, and a key U.S. outpost that has been a previous source of tensions . The same location has come under drone attack before, with a coordinated raid in October blamed on Iran or Iranian-backed militia groups. Prior to that, in June 2017, a U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle fighter also shot down a drone after it had released an unspecified weapon outside At Tanf. The Typhoon, or rather the flight of two Typhoons, involved in the latest incident would have been operating from RAF Akrotiri on the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean.

Bill Urban, the spokesman for U.S. Central Command, there were two drones that entered the airspace around At Tanf. “As one of the [drones] continued its course deeper into the At Tanf Deconfliction Zone, it was assessed as demonstrating hostile intent and was shot down,” he said. Initial reports erroneously suggested a U.S. fighter jet had made the kill. As for the second drone, it turned and left the area. The Typhoon, for its part, has become the workhorse of the RAF combat fleet over the Middle East, following the withdrawal of the Tornado GR4 strike aircraft . However, it has been used up till now for air-to-ground missions and reconnaissance. Indeed, the Typhoon underwent a program codenamed Centurion to allow it to take on the strike missions previously flown by Tornados, including using the Storm Shadow cruise missile and the Brimstone precision anti-armor missile , as well as the Paveway IV that was already available to the RAF Typhoon. While the U.K. Ministry of Defense has described the drone-kill incident as “a tribute to the skill and professionalism of Royal Air Force pilots,” it is also very likely of considerable historical significance. While RAF pilots did score some aerial victories flying Royal Navy jets against Argentinian opposition in the Falklands War of 1982 , we have to go back as far as 1948, and the Arab-Israeli conflict, to find the last time an RAF pilot, flying an RAF aircraft, was successful in an air-to-air engagement . At that time, the RAF aircraft being flown was a Spitfire — a far cry from the Typhoons being operated over the Middle East today. This incident isn’t the first time At Tanf has been targeted by drones, and these incursions — including the most recent one in October — have been tied directly or indirectly to Iran. Whatever the origin of the two drones involved in this latest incident, it points again to the growing threat posed by these kinds of small unmanned aerial vehicles , one that the United States, among others, is taking increasingly seriously . With the drone threat now a fixed part of the dynamic in the Middle East, British, as well as American and other allied jets, will continue to be on call to guard against them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 1, 2022",The Marines’ Amphibious Assault Vehicles Just Got Banned From Going In The Water Indefinitely,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has decided to ban its entire fleet of tracked Amphibious Assault Vehicles , or AAVs, from taking part in “regularly scheduled deployments” or entering the water for any reason except to support emergency crisis response operations. This comes more than a year after an AAV sank during a training exercise , killing eight Marines and a U.S. Navy sailor, an accident that was attributed to a slew of maintenance, training, and leadership failures. The Corps is already working toward replacing its aging AAVs with new 8×8 wheeled Amphibious Combat Vehicles , or ACVs, but is also in process of scaling back its heavy vehicle capabilities – it notably began divesting all of its M1 Abrams tanks last year – as part of a radical redesign of its overall force structure. The Marine Corps announced the new policies for employing its AAVs, a primary job of which is to move troops and equipment ashore from amphibious warfare ships, earlier today. It’s not clear how many AAVs, of which there are a number of variants, the service has in inventory in total at present. A 2016 edition of The Military Balance , an authoritative guide to military forces around the world that is published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a U.K.-based think tank, put the figure at 1,311 vehicles. A Marine AAV exits the water during training, something the service has now prohibited., USMC “The Marine Corps stands by the efficacy of the recommendations that came from the multiple investigations into the AAV mishap from the summer of 2020, and with those recommendations implemented and sustained, the AAV is a safe and effective vehicle for amphibious operations,” the service said in a statement according to USNI News . “That said, given the current state of the amphibious vehicle program, the Commandant of the Marine Corps has decided the AAV will no longer serve as part of regularly scheduled deployments or train in the water during military exercises; AAVs will only return to operating in the water if needed for crisis response. This decision was made in the interest of the long-term health of the amphibious vehicle programs and future capabilities.” This is a reversal of a decision the Marines made in April to allow AAVs across the service to return to the water after certain inspections of the vehicles were completed and after amphibious vehicle units went through new certification processes regarding their operation. Certain units had already begun doing so before then , after meeting the specified requirements, in order to meet scheduled operational and training demands. A Marine AAV on the water in Norway during an exercise in November 2020., USMC The Marine Corps is adamant that this policy change will not end AAV operations for good. “The AAV will continue to operate on land,” the service’s statement to USNI News said. “In doing so, we reserve the capability to reverse this decision should the need arise.” Conceivably, AAVs could even still take part in amphibious operations, albeit in the ironic position of having to use Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercrafts and other landing craft to get from ships to shore like any other vehicle. Certain ships might also be able to unload them directly ashore using established or temporary port facilities. No matter what, this can only represent a significant loss of amphibious assault capability of the Marine Corps, at least in the near term. At the same time, the final fate of service’s AAVs has appeared to be increasingly in limbo in recent years. The Marine Corps first began operating the AAV family, the original variants of which were known as the LVTP-7 series , in 1972, but has upgraded and overhauled the vehicles on multiple occasions since then. However, they have become notoriously labor-intensive to keep properly maintained, something that was a factor in the fatal accident last year. In 2018, the Marines announced that they had selected a version of the SuperAV 8×8 wheeled light armored vehicle, which had been proposed by a team-up of U.K.-headquartered defense contractor BAE Systems and Italian vehicle-maker Iveco, as the winner of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program and the intended replacement for its AAVs. The ACV program was a follow-on to the abortive Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) effort, which has resulted in the development of a complex high-speed tracked amphibious vehicle design, but that was canceled in 2012 due to ballooning costs. The ACV is smaller, slower on the water, and has less troop-carrying capacity than the AAV, but is faster on land and has been touted as being easier to operate and maintain. Its remote weapon station can accommodate a .50 caliber M2 machine gun or a 40mm Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher, but not both as is the case with the AAV’s current turret. The Marine Corps is looking to acquire at least some up-gunned ACVs with turrets armed with 30mm automatic cannons that would provide substantially improved firepower. After the selection of the winning ACV design, the Marine Corps decided to halt a refresh of the AAV fleet. The planned upgrade package included, among other things , new engine, transmission, and suspension components that would have improved the vehicle’s overall performance, even with the added weight of additional armor and other added features, and helped with their reliability. Still, in announcing the new policies relating to AAV employment today, the Marine Corps admitted that “76 percent of its tasks are land-based” already, which raises questions about exactly how useful the service felt the vehicles were for amphibious operations even before making this decision. There is also the question about what will happen now to the proficiency of AAV crews in the skill sets they need to be able to safely and effectively operate in an amphibious context if they cannot train on the water going forward. This could limit the ability of the Marine Corps to deploy any significant number of AAVs in those environments in the future even in an emergency scenario. Even with all this in mind, it very much remains to be seen how the Marine Corps’ new rules regarding the use of AAVs will ultimately impact its operations. The service’s Force Design 2030 initiative, which it unveiled last year, significantly deemphasizes the importance of traditional armored vehicles, amphibious or otherwise. As part of this force structure plan, the Corps will have divested its entire fleet of M1 Abrams tanks and other heavy armored vehicles by 2023. One of the last of the Marine Corps’ M1 Abrams tanks at the service’s base at Twentynine Palms in California is trucked away as part of a service-wide divestment plan., USMC It has also cut its planned purchases of ACVs roughly in half, down to 632 examples from the original expected fleet size of 1,1,22 vehicles. It’s unclear how many ACVs the Marines have received so far, but the service was expected to have taken delivery of around 76 of them by the end of this year. Another 80 are set to arrive each year going forward. These are just some of the dramatic changes the Marines are making as the service remodels itself to be better suited for new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations, known collectively as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO), which you can read more about here . EABO is centered on the idea of employing smaller, more mobile, and highly flexible groups of Marines to rapidly establish temporary forward bases in remote and austere locations, while also retaining the ability to readily redeploy to new areas. From these sites, Marines would be able to exert control over portions of the battlespace, including adjacent seaspaces. New capabilities, including ground-launched anti-ship missiles and more capable unmanned aircraft than are in Marine service now, would be key to these future operations, as would be a fleet of new Light Amphibious Warships . The latter vessels reflect another major planned shift on the part of the Marines away from relying on traditional amphibious warfare vessels . “We will become smaller if we have to,” Marine Corps Gen. David Berger, the service’s top officer, told reporters at the Reagan National Defense Forum earlier this month. “We have to provide the Marines what they need to operate in that environment. And if that [means] less Marines, I’m willing to do that. I don’t want to do that. … I’d rather have a smaller Marine Corps that can deal with that, than a big Marine Corps that doesn’t have that capability.” All told, whatever happens to the Marine Corps’ AAV fleet going forward, these vehicles appear to be firmly entering the twilight of their careers after nearly five decades in service, and their days of operating out on the water look to be all but over.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 12, 2021",Damaged USS Connecticut Likely Had A “Nightmare Voyage” To San Diego Says Veteran Submariner (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s damaged nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN-22) made a secretive journey from Guam to San Diego over the last few weeks, with the submarine arriving unannounced in San Diego harbor on the morning of Dec. 12, 2021. The voyage was likely incredibly uncomfortable and fraught with danger. To give us a better idea of the risks involved and what this ordeal would have been like for Connecticut’s crew, we talked to our friend and veteran submariner Aaron Amick who spent 20 years on submarines as a Sonarman and now runs the excellent website Sub Brief that covers all matters regarding submarines and naval warfare. A little background first. The Seawolf class submarine, of which there are only three in existence, slammed into an underwater seamount on Oct. 2, 2021, in the South China Sea and subsequently limped its way to Guam where the damage was assessed . While the full extent of the damage is unknown , the boat’s entire forward sonar dome was ripped off as a result of the impact. Connecticut will now need major repairs, likely spending years in dry dock , in order to return to sea, if indeed she is able to do so. Still, just getting her to a place where she can receive this level of attention was a major undertaking, with the stricken sub traveling over 6,000 miles in what would have been a marathon in endurance for her crew, the leadership of which was quickly replaced following the accident. So with that background in mind, here is our exchange: Considering what we know about Connecticut ’s collision and damage, one would think it would not be able to safely dive and it would have made the trip from Guam to California on the surface. Is this your assessment as well? Yes. I think they transited on the surface, with at least one support vessel, at an average speed of 10 knots. What is it like traveling in a submarine while it is surfaced? What does it feel like in different sea conditions? A submarine on the surface is constantly rolling side-to-side even in the calmest of seas. It would have induced ‘sea sickness’ to those susceptible. If the rolls were large enough, it would have been tough to move or even sleep in a bunk. Most bunks have a towel rack, I have had to hook my forearm into it to help keep from being tossed out onto the deck in rough seas. The lack of sleep, or what little sleep the sailors got, probably led to a lot of fatigue after the first few days of the over 20-day journey. Feeling seasick and exhausted is not ideal for watchstanding. It’s likely they implemented a flexible or augmented watch rotation for anyone who could not complete their watch. The watches are reduced during surface transits. For instance, you don’t need a diving officer. Watches in Sonar and other stations operate at reduced staff. In fact, on the surface, sonar is pretty useless and Connecticut’s bow sonar array is totally useless in its current state. The Seawolf class has other sonar arrays along its flank that may still operate. They may have chosen to man those systems, but on the surface, radar is probably the primary sensor for contact management. So it’s possible some crew were flown to the states and there was a reduced ‘skeleton’ crew onboard during the transit. That being said, because of the damage to Connecticut , there were probably additional watchstanders monitoring the forward bulkhead of the pressure hull and any hull penetrations below the waterline. The ride is already pretty bad with the dome on. I imagine it was a very wild ride for the crew considering the damage. I expect everyone was exhausted when they reached San Diego. What are the general risks associated with traveling on the surface? Collision is the largest peacetime risk while on the surface. Submarines are not as fast and less maneuverable than their surface ship counterparts. This requires officers to think ahead and plan maneuvers to avoid close contacts. Bridge watchstander safety is also a concern. A watchstander in the bridge can fall overboard and weather can cause everything from heat exhaustion to frostbite. Bridge watchstanding with sick and fatigued sailors can lead to disaster. In this case, there would be at least one officer and one enlisted lookout on the bridge [atop the submarine’s sail]. If things got busy, they may add an additional phone talker to manage communications below decks, but that is only in extreme situations like when there are a high number of close contacts near shore. U.S. Navy What about in a situation when the boat cannot dive at all? Voyage planning is a large part of transiting a damaged submarine that can’t dive. Weather, specifically sea state, would play a role in the route from Guam to the West Coast of the United States. They may have had to go around some foul storms. For ventilation, they probably had the hatch to the bridge open at all times. If that’s the case, rain would have easily gotten inside the submarine. This would require frequent attention to prevent it from pooling. One would think traveling at slow speed due to the damage done to Connecticut and not being able to dive would make for an arduous journey that would last at least over 6,000 miles. What do you think the journey was like for the crew? I think the journey was tedious, exhausting, and miserable for everyone onboard. For anyone who was seasick, it was a nightmare voyage. What about the preparations for such a journey? They would have briefed the journey in detail before going underway. Plotted a route, got water space from squadron (water space is deconfliction much like ‘airspace.’ Imagine if squadron is part of an air traffic control network across the globe) and coordinated with an escort support vessel. Weather probably played a large role as to when they left and how they transited across the Pacific. I think they would have had a lot of easy-to-prepare meals. Maybe even MRE’s in case they could not cook in high sea states. It’s common to serve ‘cold cuts’ on the surface if the cooks can’t keep the food on the grill. Cold Cuts are just pre-sliced processed meats and cheese with sliced bread. SSN-22 is seen underway years before its collision. , U.S. Navy She must have had escorts. What do you think a proper package of assets would be to see she got back to the continental United States safe? I would expect, at a minimum, there should have been an armed escort to provide additional security, sensor, and communication support. Maritime aviation should have been part of the escort, but not a necessity. Preferably, a submarine support and rescue vessel should have sailed near her the entire trip. I don’t know if one was available or in Guam, so it is possible that didn’t happen. Based on the very limited information we have at this time, do you think USS Connecticut will be able to be returned to service? This is purely speculative on my part, but if there is no significant damage to the prime mover (power train), I think she will return to service after a lengthy drydock and recertification period. I am very proud of the officers and crew who managed this trans-Pacific trip in a damaged submarine. It was very risky and could have ended with the loss of the vessel. Their professionalism and determination brought USS Connecticut home and that is quite an accomplishment. UPDATE: We now have footage showing just how rough a ride it is even in relatively calm coastal seas for Connecticut as it left San Diego on December 15th, 2021. You can check out that video and the update on its voyage here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 12, 2021",Damaged Submarine USS Connecticut Has Left San Diego On Its Voyage Home (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Seawolf class nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut has had one heck of past few months. She was stuck in Guam for two months after slamming into a seamount in the South China Sea before she could head back to the Continental United States for what will be a very extensive set of repairs. The secret 6,000-plus-mile journey from Guam to San Diego was likely a very unpleasant one for her crew, and even her unannounced arrival in San Diego seemed like more of a diversion than a final destination. The Navy had said that the stricken sub would return to her homeport in Bremerton, Washington, for repairs. Now it appears she is headed on the final leg of her journey out of San Diego and up to the Pacific Northwest. Our friend and prolific naval ship movements tracker @warshipcam posted video shot from San Diego Webcam this afternoon showing the bow-less Connecticut heading out to sea. She had only been in San Diego for just over three days, arriving on the morning of Sunday , December 12th. At the time, we noted that the destroyer USS Mustin (DDG-89) seemed to have escorted her across the Pacific, providing basic safety and force protection for the submarine. Now there is more evidence that this was indeed the case, as that destroyer left San Diego with Connecticut this afternoon. The video of Connecticut ‘s departure also gives us our best look at her and the damage to her bow so far: SanDiegoWebcam SanDiegoWebcam The Navy has offered no details about Connecticut’s special voyage. Instead, they have simply clarified that she did arrive in San Diego and that she was in sound condition after her Pacific crossing. It still is not clear exactly why she ended up in San Diego first instead of going straight to Washington State. It seems most likely that a powerful weather system that pounded California with moisture was the main reason for its diversion. A planned stop there is also possible, which may have been a result of routing closer to other contingency ports, such as Pearl Harbor, but it is farther from Guam to San Diego than it is to Washington. We will continue to keep you up to date on what will be a long and challenging process of getting Connecticut back into an operational state once again. Hopefully, we will find out much more about her journey home once she arrives in Bremerton. UPDATE: The clip below shows just how wild of a ride it is on the surface for Connecticut . Veteran Submariner Aaron Amick detailed this in a recent Q&A we did with him about the submarine 6,000+ mile, weeks-long journey across the Pacific. Imagine doing this for nearly three weeks? Also, this is in relatively calm seas, not the open ocean. I also received some correspondence regarding how much worse this would be without a streamlined bow, as is the configuration of SSN-22 since its mishap. A huge thanks to the submariners who pulled off this transit!

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020",StormBreaker Mini Glide Bombs Take Longer To Load Onto Strike Eagles Due To Their Data Links,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s new GBU-53/B StormBreaker glide bomb needs “additional coordination and planning” before it’s loaded onto a jet, which has just begun operationally fielding the weapon. The Air Force says the fact that the StormBreaker and aircraft communicate with each other means intelligence airmen have to load encrypted information into the bomb’s computer, resulting in a more laborious process to get the weapons actually loaded and ready for use. The revelation comes in an Air Force press release marking the introduction of the StormBreaker, previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), into operational service, with the 391st Fighter Squadron, an F-15E Strike Eagle unit that’s part of the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The squadron conducted a first launch of the new weapon in training on November 2, but only announced the milestone this week. An F-15E drops a StormBreaker during an earlier test., RAYTHEON The 391st Fighter Squadron employed the StormBreaker during a Weapon System Evaluation Program, or WSEP, the Air Force’s premier live-fire weapons event, which you can read more about here . During WSEP at the Utah Test and Training Range, four F-15Es from the squadron engaged four moving vehicle targets on the ground with four StormBreakers. The WSEP was judged a success, with all of the vehicles being hit. However, the Air Force also noted that compared to at least some of the other weapons already in the F-15E’s armory, actually getting the new smart bomb ready and loaded on the jet was more onerous, “due to [the] increased capabilities of this munition.” 1st Lt. Estefania Ortiz-Santiago, the 391st Fighter Squadron Officer in Charge of Intelligence, explained that “the process was more extensive,” the Air Force adding that “a fair amount of troubleshooting [was needed] to ensure assets were communicating properly.” While Ortiz-Santiago stated that the process should be smoothed out as the Air Force gains more experience with the weapon, the implication is clearly that the StormBreaker currently places increased demands on intelligence airmen compared to at least some other stores. The Air Force did not specify exactly how long it takes to prepare a jet loaded with StormBreakers but said that it hopes that, eventually, it will take “about the same amount of time to prepare as other bombs currently in use by the F-15E.” As we have explored in the past , the StormBreaker offers the Air Force some significant capabilities, being based around a tri-mode guidance system that allows it to find targets using imaging infrared or millimeter-wave radar or using semi-active laser homing to hit a designated aimpoint. The result is an especially flexible weapon, able to engage both stationary and moving targets, even at night or in bad weather. The tri-mode seeker for the StormBreaker smart weapon., Raytheon According to the Air Force, the bomb is able to strike stationary targets at 69 miles and moving targets at 45 miles. The StormBreaker is also notably compact, with a length of just 69 inches and a diameter of no more than seven inches. It weighs 204 pounds and a single F-15E can carry up to 28 examples. Cristy Stagg, Raytheon Missile Systems, and Col. Jason Rusco, Armament Directorate, unveil a display model of the StormBreaker at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in 2019., U.S. Air Force/Kevin Gaddie All this means the StormBreaker is likely to be a weapon of choice for the F-15E, which is, in turn, one of the Air Force’s most in-demand assets for contingencies around the globe. However, the fact that intelligence personnel are involved in the loading process for these bombs in a more significant way than is the case with at least some other weapons employed on the F-15E might impact the flexibility of the Strike Eagle/StormBreaker combination. Increasingly, the operational doctrine is calling upon F-15E units, in particular, to deploy at short notice to fairly austere locations, launching missions soon after arrival, or even en route, as part of the Agile Combat Employment initiative, or ACE. These kinds of capabilities have already been tested in real-world scenarios involving F-15Es loaded with up to 15 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) flying between locations in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of operations. The aim of that 15-JDAM loadout configuration was to bring larger quantities of smart munitions to deployed locations, for which the StormBreaker would also seem to offer considerable advantages, thanks to the significant number that can be carried by a single jet. An F-15E carrying StormBreakers., Raytheon But for the time being, at least, it sounds as if the Air Force is not happy with the time and effort needed to get the ready weapon for action. Ironically, this drawback is apparently a product of one of StormBreaker’s key advantages — its ability to communicate with the aircraft carrying it. This means the weapon can be launched and, if required, redirected to a new target once in flight, as well as receiving regular midcourse updates. Data linking, moreover, is only going to become more common and more expansive as time goes on, especially with new initiatives in the works like Golden Horde , a swarming air-launched munitions program, for which StormBreaker could be an ideal candidate. As weapons are increasingly networked to each other and other tertiary assets, as well as to their launch platforms, the cryptologic demands can only increase and, with that, the requirement for those signals to be made secure against jamming, intercepting, and spoofing. Specially-configured Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDB), based on the SDB I, have been used during the Golden Horde experiment., AFRL/PUBLIC DOMAIN Once these communications are being employed across extended ranges, with a variety of complex data being sent back and forth, the issue only becomes greater. As a result, there are entirely new layers of operational security to deal with, at least compared to the comparatively simple process of transmitting the coordinates from the aircraft to the weapon’s guidance system while it is still on the aircraft, as is the case with a JDAM, for example. On the other hand, despite the expectation that the StormBreaker will become easier to deploy in the future, it’s intended as a complementary weapon within the F-15E’s armory, rather than a direct successor to other existing stores. “It is not a replacement for other bombs,” said Capt. Kyle “Scrap” Holifield, 391st Fighter Squadron, Chief of Weapons and Tactics. “I think it’s going to be great. It will be an awesome weapon,” he added. Although the GBU-53/B is so far only integrated on the F-15E, it’s also planned to be cleared for use by the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and is expected to be an important weapon for the F-35 stealth fighter . Ultimately, however, the increased demands on coordination and planning that the StormBreaker brings are likely to be reflected, at least to a degree, in other new-generation weapons that stress enhanced connectivity with the launch platform, or even with each other. For air-launched munitions, in particular, the Air Force is especially keen to leverage the advantages offered by networking, including the ability to be dynamically retargeted , to use offboard sensors for targeting throughout the flight and even operate in swarms to enhance effectiveness and survivability. Therefore, as networking becomes an ever more important element in the way that munitions are employed, the lessons learned when introducing the StormBreaker may be expected to make a valuable contribution to other programs too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 22, 2020",USS Portland Uses Its Experimental Laser To Fry A Floating Target In The Middle East,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s San Antonio class amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland engaged a static surface training target with its laser directed energy weapon in the Gulf of Aden yesterday. This ship received this weapon, which is officially called the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator Mk 2 Mod 0, in late 2019, which The War Zone was first to report , and subsequently used it to knock down a small drone in a demonstration in the Pacific Ocean the following year. Portland is presently in the Middle East as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group, which also includes the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex and the Harpers Ferry class dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor (LSD 52). Elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) are embarked across all three of those ships. A view from onboard the USS Portland during the demonstration of its Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) Mk 2 Mod 0 in the Gulf of Aden on Dec. 14, 2021., USN The U.S. Navy described Portland ‘s laser as having “engaged” the raft-like floating target during the demonstration. It is unclear how much physical damage the directed energy weapon actually did to the target or whether it was considered destroyed as a result. The maximum effective range of the laser is unknown, but the images from this latest test do make clear that the beam can hit targets at a not insignificant distance away from the ship. A low-quality view of the static, raft-like target that USS Portland engaged with its laser during the demonstration the Gulf of Aden., USN “The LWSD [Laser Weapon System Demonstrator] is considered a next-generation follow-on to the Laser Weapon System (LaWS) that afloat forward staging base USS Ponce (AFSB(I)-15) tested for three years while operating in the Middle East,” according to a Navy release on the demonstration in the Gulf of Aden. “The region’s geography, climate, and strategic importance offer a unique environment for technology innovation.” A view of the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 on USS Portland ‘s bow., USN The LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0, which Northrop Grumman developed for the Navy as part of the Solid-State Laser Technology Maturation (SSL-TM) program, is a 150-kilowatt class laser weapon. The War Zone was first to identify the system after it appeared in San Diego back in 2019. It is designed primarily as a close-in defense system to help protect ships against unmanned aircraft and small boat swarms . It can also be employed as a dazzler to blind optical sensors and seeker systems, as well as function as a surveillance system leveraging the integral full-motion video cameras it otherwise uses to detect and track targets for the laser. The video below is from the demonstration of USS Portland ‘s laser in the Pacific in 2020. As the Navy itself noted, this is not the first time it has deployed a ship to the region with an operational laser weapon. However, the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 is significantly more powerful than the 30-kilowatt class AN/SEQ-3 LaWS that was installed on Ponce . The AN/SEQ-3, along with the earlier 15-kilowatt class Maritime Laser Demonstrator (MLD), both of which were also developed by Northrop Grumman , were stepping stones to the design currently fitted on Portland . It makes good sense for the Navy to have now deployed Portland to the Middle East and demonstrated the LWSD Mk 2 Mod in the region. The Gulf of Aden, situated between Yemen and Somalia, is a higher-risk area for drone and small watercraft attacks launched by Yemeni Houthi militants. For the size of the group, the Iranian-backed Houthis have an impressive arsenal of unmanned aircraft, including various types of so-called “suicide drones,” and remote-controlled explosive-laden small boats , along with cruise and ballistic missiles , naval mines , and other capabilities . The Houthis have targeted U.S. Navy vessels , among others, in the past. Other Iranian proxies, and Iran itself, operate various kinds of small drones, including armed types, in the region. Iranian forces have been blamed for a number of suicide drone attacks on commercial ships tied to Israel just this year. This includes an attack on the Liberian-flagged, Israeli-operated tanker M/T Mercer Street in the Gulf of Oman in July, which killed one British and one Romanian national. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a particularly notable operator of small boats . The IRGC has employed them in swarms to harass U.S. naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman on multiple occasions just this year , including two incidents where American ships fired warning shots in response . These are exactly the kinds of threats that the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 is intended to help protect against and underscores why the Navy is interested in adding directed energy weapons to various ships. The particular design on Portland is just one of a number of directed energy weapons the Navy has in various stages of testing and development. A handful of Arleigh Burke class destroyers, including the USS Dewey and USS Stockdale , are now equipped with the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN), which as the name implies is primarily a dazzler. The USS Preble , another ship of that class, is set to become the first to carry the High-Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance, or HELIOS, a Lockheed Martin design expected to have somewhat capabilities similar to those of the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0. The first HELIOS system delivered to the Navy has been undergoing tests this year on land at Wallops Island in Virginia. The Navy’s already plans to integrate more laser weapons of various types onto additional ships in the coming years. Beyond being a test of the weapon itself, Portland’s firing of the LWSD Mk 2 Mod 0 in the Gulf of Aden is a clear demonstration of the service’s progress toward a new directed-energy future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 16, 2022",Israel’s Request To Speed Delivery Of KC-46 Tankers Critical For Striking Iran Denied,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has reportedly declined requests from Israeli officials to accelerate the delivery of KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers, citing a backlog at the manufacturer that is the result of technical and quality control issues. Those same reports say that Israeli authorities have been particularly keen to get these aircraft sooner rather than later given the critical role they would play in potential airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear enterprise. The New York Times published a story on the deliberations between U.S. and Israeli officials over the KC-46A delivery schedule, as well as the impetus behind the Israeli government’s desire to speed up the timetable, yesterday. That built on an initial report on the tanker delivery plans from Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth . There have already been growing indications that Israel’s government, under its new Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, might be looking to at least revive the threat of strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, something the country’s military is reportedly now more actively training to do. This all comes as negotiations between the United States and Iran over the latter country’s nuclear ambitions, which many fear could include nuclear weapons, appear to be on the verge of collapsing . An artist’s conception of an Israeli Air Force KC-46A tanker refueling an F-15., Israeli Ministry of Defense The U.S. government first approved the potential sale of eight KC-46As, along with various ancillary items and services in a complete package valued at around $2.4 billion, to Israel in March 2020. In February, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced it had signed off on the purchase of the first two of those aircraft, but at that time it was unclear when the Israeli Air Force might begin to receive those aircraft. The New York Times’ report yesterday said these planes are not presently expected to touch down in Israel before 2024. There had been reports last year that the Israeli government had been looking to get that initial pair of KC-46As from a lot of aircraft Boeing was already under contract to build for the U.S. Air Force. It’s not clear whether or not that is part of the current plan. The most immediate issue is reportedly the fact that Boeing is already behind schedule in deliveries of KC-46As to the U.S. Air Force, which also sees these tankers as essential to its future plans. These delays are due to a continuing slew of technical problems with the aircraft and quality control slips on the production line. Just in September, it had emerged that Pegasus deliveries were halted for around a month earlier this year after a plastic cap was found jammed in an internal fuel line on one of these aircraft as it flew to its new home at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina. This was not the first time the U.S. Air Force has stopped accepting these planes from Boeing on account of various kinds of so-called foreign object debris, or FOD, being discovered inside, which is a safety issue. A U.S. Air Force KC-46A., USAF However, even if the production line issues were resolved, the KC-46A’s design is in the process of being reworked to address long-standing problems with its boom and the Remote Vision System (RVS) that operators use to guide it into receiving aircraft. Unlike in previous U.S. Air Force tankers, where the boom operators would physically be in a position at the rear of the aircraft to do their work, these individuals on the Pegasuses perform their tasks from the main cabin via an array of cameras at the back of the plane that feed into the complex RVS, which is a hybrid 2D/3D system that requires operators to wear special glasses similar to ones you would use to watch a modern 3D movie in a theater. You can read more about the boom and RVS issues here . The Air Force has said it does not expect to be suitably resolved until sometime between 2023 and 2024. Until then, these aircraft will continue to have an at best limited ability to carry out their core aerial refueling mission. Boom operators wearing specialized glasses use the Remote Vision System (RVS) on a KC-46A., USAF What this means is that even if Israel did manage to accelerate the timetable for the delivery of its first KC-46As, the actual operational utility of those planes might still be limited until 2024. This is important because the primary driver behind the Israeli government’s desire to get these tankers sooner is reportedly the need for improved aerial refueling capacity to support potential strikes on Iran, which would be a complex, high-risk operation. Right now, the Israeli Air Force relies entirely on an aging fleet of just seven Boeing 707-based tankers , having retired three of these aircraft already in recent years, to support its fixed-wing tactical jets. The KC-46, if its various issues can be fully resolved, would offer Israel a much more modern and capable tanker able to, among other things, simply carry more fuel than these older aircraft. One of Israel’s existing Boeing 707-based tankers., IAF “While they still fly, the new fleet of KC-46 tankers would give Israel far more range and ability, because it can refuel fighter jets and bombers and also receive fuel itself while in flight,” according to The New York Times ‘ report. “The ability to refuel is critical — otherwise Israeli planes would have to depend on the aging tankers or land in the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia. Both countries are rivals of Iran, but neither wants to be implicated in assisting an attack.” At the same time, the Israelis have extensive experience conducting complicated long-range strikes and have continued to bolster their capabilities to do, particularly with their specially configured F-15 Eagle variants . Additional tanker capacity would still help in a larger scale, sustained air operation across extended distances. In addition, it could be particularly valuable for supporting the Israeli Air Force’s F-35I Adir stealth fighters . These jets would be extremely useful for penetrating through Iranian air defenses and neutralizing them, helping to ensure the success of any airstrikes, especially those carried out by non-stealthy jets, but they cannot carry range-extending external fuel tanks themselves. Though there is no indication that the Israeli government is considering doing so, difficulties in acquiring the new KC-46As might prompt discussions about alternatives. Airbus’ popular A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), a new variant of which Lockheed Martin is presently pitching to the U.S. Air Force itself as another option for a future tanker, had been in the running against the Pegasus. There were also reports that Boeing had stifled a plan by Israel Aerospace Industries’ Bedek Aviation Group to offer converted second-hand Boeing 767s, similar to aircraft it had previously sold to Brazil and Colombia. The KC-46A is also based on the 767 design. That being said, ensuring suitable aerial refueling capacity would just be one part of the complex process Israel would face when planning future airstrikes on targets in Iran. The Iranians are well aware of the threats they face and have increasingly moved nuclear and missile-related infrastructure into hardened underground facilities . Getting at those sites using conventional air-launched weapons would require significant bunker-busting capabilities. Only the United States has the ability to directly attack the most deeply buried of these targets, especially the underground nuclear facility at Fordo, via conventional bombs. This is the job for the GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator carried by U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers . So, it is not as if Israel can fully wipe out Iran’s nuclear program from the air without direct U.S. support. Israel is known to have at least some U.S.-supplied GBU-28/B laser-guided 5,000-pound class bunker-buster bombs, but these are aging weapons, and their reliability has been called into question in the past . The U.S. Air Force is presently in the process of developing a new 5,000-pound class bunker-buster to replace its own stocks of GBU-28/Bs. There are unconfirmed reports that Israel is already looking to inquire about getting some of these new weapons, but they have yet to enter American service and simply might not be available in any serious quantities for some time still. The Israeli Air Force could still use smaller bunker-buster weapons to attack less hardened targets, and there are certainly other targets related to Iran’s nuclear program that are not so well protected that could be struck by standard guided bombs or standoff missiles. Any aerial campaign against Iran would no doubt also seek to neuter that country’s ability to retaliate against Israel directly using its missile arsenal. Again, while many missile-related sites are underground , Israeli aircraft would still have a significant number of relevant targets above ground to strike. Even Iran’s ability to launch ballistic missiles through launch wells in these facilities could potentially be disabled by direct attacks using the bunker-busters they currently have. In addition, with regards to any underground facilities, Israel’s jets could target entry points to hamper immediate access, forcing Iranian officials to expend the time and energy to dig out those sites and anyone who might be trapped in them. Other kinds of attacks on deeply buried facilities, including commando raids on the ground or ballistic missile strikes might be employed together with a large-scale air operation, as well. Even ways to contaminate these key installations could be deployed. Israel is already widely understood to have been conducting a campaign of assassinations and sabotage , to include cyberattacks , often with the support of the United States, over the years as an alternative means of hobbling Iran’s nuclear ambitions. These operations would likely be greatly expanded if Israel were to act directly in a major operation against Iran’s nuclear program. No matter what, at present, Israel does seem to be keen to at least keep the option of some kind of military action open as a deterrent against Iran pursuing nuclear weapons. There is always the potential that this might involve airstrikes or other operations aimed at achieving more indirect objectives, such as targeting key figures in the regime in Tehran. The Israeli military has been ordered to “prepare for the Iranian challenge at the operational level,” Defense Minister Benny Gantz told reporters last week at the Israeli American Council’s annual national summit, which was held in Florida. “There is room for international pressure — political, economic and also military — in order to convince Iran to stop its fantasies about a nuclear program.” Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz at a meeting at the Pentagon on Dec. 9, 2021., AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta “The desire is always to coordinate with [the United States] what we are doing, but at the end of the day Israel is responsible for its own fate and will protect the security of its citizens,” Israel Defense Force (IDF) Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who may be in line to become the IDF’s Chief of Staff, said at that same event . Still, “it would be a challenge to launch such an operation without coordinating with the Americans,” he conceded. All of this comes as U.S. officials continue to publicly express more and more pessimism about the future of talks with Iran about a new agreement covering its nuclear program. Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an earlier multi-national deal in 2018 that had imposed limitations on Iran’s nuclear aspirations. Since then, the regime in Tehran has systematically violated all the key terms of the arrangement. The Iranian government has, in particular, stepped up nuclear enrichment activities that Israeli officials and others are concerned could put them closer to building a bomb, should Iran choose to do so. Even so, the U.S. intelligence community has continued to assess that there is no indication that authorities in Iran have actually made such a decision. Israeli and U.S. officials have reportedly been discussing potential “Plan B” options — which could include new economic sanctions, cyberattacks, or indirect military action against Iranian proxies in the Middle East — if talks with Iran do collapse for good. Whether or not the lack of KC-46As or any other capability on the part of the Israeli military ultimately prevents it from taking unilateral action against Iran, if officials in Israel determine that course of action to be necessary to protect the country’s interests remains to be seen.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 12, 2022",UAE F-35 Stealth Fighter Deal Hangs By A Thread Amid Chinese Espionage Worries,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The effort to sell F-35A stealth fighters to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has taken another turn, with the Emirati government threatening to scrap plans to buy the aircraft, as well as MQ-9B drones , due to concerns over stringent safeguards to protect these systems against Chinese espionage. The development comes less than two weeks after it was announced that the UAE was to become the biggest export customer for the French Dassault Rafale fighter, placing an order for 80 jets worth $16 billion. According to a report today from the Wall Street Journal ’s Gordon Lubold and Warren P. Strobel, citing unnamed U.S. officials, the UAE government has informed Washington by letter that it plans to abandon the deal to buy 50 F-35As , up to 18 MQ-9Bs, and $10-billion-worth of advanced munitions. That arms package, approved at the end of the previous Trump administration, was valued at up to $23.37 billion. U.S. Air Force F-35As from the 421st Fighter Squadron, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, arrive at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, in May last year., U.S. Air Force/Maj. Rodney Ellison “The UAE has informed the U.S. that it will suspend discussions to acquire the F-35,” an Emirati official said in a statement, according to the WSJ . “Technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and the cost/benefit analysis led to the reassessment.” However, the same UAE official also said the United States “remains the UAE’s preferred provider for advanced defense requirements and discussions for the F-35 may be reopened in the future.” U.S. officials have confirmed receipt of the letter. Meanwhile, a report from Breaking Defense paints a more pessimistic picture, quoting an unnamed UAE official as saying that discussions about the proposed deal have been “suspended” indefinitely pending a “full reassessment” of the terms of the agreement. According to this report, the letter sent to Washington served to withdraw the l etters of offer and acceptance, or LOAs, the government-to-government agreements that identify the defense equipment and services to be sold by the U.S. government. The move is the latest signal that all is not well in the military relationship between the United States and the UAE, with the China factor being the key point of concern. In particular, the Emirati government considers that security requirements demanded by the United States are unacceptable. These safeguards are specifically intended to keep sensitive military technology and capabilities from falling into Chinese hands. A United Arab Emirates Mirage 2000, a UAE F-16 Desert Falcon, and a U.S. F-35A during a partnering flight in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, in May 2019., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Chris Drzazgowski While the UAE deal had previously been in limbo, it may now be dead in the water. Or, as the WSJ surmises, the Emirati government could be seeking better terms by threatening to back out. Possible evidence for that is the upcoming visit to the Pentagon by a UAE delegation, due this week, and the fact that the letter in question was written by a lower-ranking Emirati official. Washington now appears to be faced with a difficult balancing act. On the one hand, the security surrounding the F-35, and to a lesser extent the MQ-9, must remain sacrosanct, protecting one of the most important capabilities for the Pentagon and many allies. At the same time, industry and government are keen to push through a lucrative deal, despite opposition from some lawmakers in Washington. Their concern is driven by different factors, including the erosion of Israel’s so-called “ qualitative military edge ” in the Middle East and criticism of the UAE’s role in the civil war in Yemen and also in Libya . Indeed, soon after taking office, President Joe Biden hit pause on the UAE arms deal but ultimately decided to go ahead with it, albeit with new caveats attached. As for the Chinese role in all this, the UAE’s relationship with Beijing has already been highlighted as a worry. Earlier this year, it appears that Washington was forced to apply pressure on the Emiratis to ensure that China halted construction work on a secretive military facility in the UAE. Other signs of a military relationship between China and the UAE have also alarmed U.S. officials. In May this year, it was reported that U.S. intelligence had become aware of at least two People’s Liberation Army aircraft arriving in the UAE to deliver unknown cargoes, presumed to be military in nature. Outside of military issues, there are broader concerns about the economic ties between China and the UAE, including the Emirati relationship with Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies. That company has long been earmarked as a potential means for Beijing to conduct espionage or disrupt communications. Coincidentally, it was British plans to have Huawei install communications infrastructure that led to calls from some U.S. lawmakers to abandon plans to permanently station its own F-35As in the United Kingdom . In the event, the United Kingdom scrapped the Huawei plans , although the UAE still relies on the company for its communications needs. With this in mind, it seems likely that the United States has slapped additional security measures on the potential F-35 sale to the UAE, although the precise nature of what these might involve is not currently clear. Whatever the case, the UAE has clearly taken exception to the move. At the same time, U.S. defense executives have remained upbeat about the prospects of signing off on the deal. During the Dubai Air Show last month, Mira Resnick, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Regional Security, told the Associated Press : “The F-35 is already in this region, whether it’s Israelis flying the F-35, whether it’s American F-35. We would like the UAE to be able to operate the F-35 in a way that [they] can be our security partners and to deter threats, including from Iran.” U.S. Air Force F-35As and Israeli Air Force F-35I Adirs during exercise Enduring Lightning III over Israel, in October 2020., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Duncan C. Bevan It certainly seems possible that the United States and UAE can still come to an agreement over the sale, with the requirement for F-35s still extant, despite the recent decision to buy Rafales. The United Arab Emirates Air Force and Air Defense already operates two fighter fleets, sourced from France and the United States. While the Rafales are potentially planned as long-term replacements for the Mirage 2000-9 fleet, that still leaves the service with F-16E/F Block 60 Desert Falcons , too, meaning that procurement of the F-35 is not necessarily an urgent issue. The original plans had called for the first F-35s to be delivered to the UAE in 2027 and there are ongoing upgrade programs to keep the F-16 and Mirage fleets viable until well beyond that date. A United Arab Emirates Air Force and Air Defense crew chief performs a pre-flight inspection on a Mirage 2000-9 prior to a Red Flag 13-2 mission on the Nellis Air Force Base flight line in 2013., U.S. Air Force/Lawrence Crespo Should the United States and UAE work out a solution to the security issue, there is still the possibility that the Emiratis could reject other conditions imposed by the Biden administration. According to the WSJ , these likely include a guarantee that the UAE will not use its F-35s in its military operations in Libya and Yemen. Now, having lined up Rafales, the UAE may well be more willing to bide its time and ensure that it gets the deal it wants. However, the United States is likely unwilling to modify its hard line on security issues, especially when it comes to fears that fifth-generation fighter technology could end up in Chinese hands or data pertaining to it being compromised.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 7, 2021",Russia Unveils Stealthier Version Of Its S-70 ‘Hunter’ Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The second flying prototype of Russia’s S-70 Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) has emerged, and it features the long-awaited stealthier nozzle configuration , among many other refinements, that should maximize the low observability and combat effectiveness of the production version. While the redesigned Sukhoi drone has yet to fly and still has a long series of evaluations ahead of it, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu has confidently predicted that test work could be completed sometime next year , paving the way for an order for the Russian Aerospace Forces, or VKS. The more production-representative flying-wing UCAV was rolled out today at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association, or NAPO, in southwestern Siberia, where the drones are being built on behalf of the Sukhoi design bureau. The unveiling of the second Okhotnik was attended by Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Alexei Krivoruchko. “The roll-out of the UAV marks the completion of the assembly of the product as a whole, equipping it with all the necessary onboard equipment in accordance with the requirements for the aircraft, and the transition to complex ground tests to prepare for the first flight,” Krivoruchko said. Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Alexei Krivoruchko, center, together with other defense ministry and industry officials at the rollout of the second prototype Okhotnik in Novosibirsk today. The scale of the nose landing gear provides an idea of the size and bulk of the UCAV. , UAC As for the engine used in the Okhotnik, this was previously reported to be a variant of the AL-41F turbofan that powers the Su-35 Flanker multirole fighter and initial versions of the Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter. It’s unclear whether the second prototype retains the same powerplant, but it’s obvious the engine exhaust has been entirely reworked, with the new, flat jet nozzle tailored to reduce infrared and radar signatures. The existence of a stealthier version of the Okhotnik had long been anticipated, with a model of the revised design appearing at the International Aviation and Space Salon, or MAKS, outside Moscow in August 2019, in the same month that the first prototype recorded its maiden flight. The original engine nozzle configuration on the first prototype Okhotnik., TV ZVEZDA CAPTURE The first prototype clearly had significant design issues that detracted heavily from achieving all-aspect low-observability, which you can read about in our initial analysis of this topic here . The model of a stealthier Okhotnik shown at MAKS 2019., COURTESY OF MICHAEL JERDEV/@MUXELAERO The much-revised, stealthier engine nozzle of the second prototype. , Twitter Screencap The model at MAKS 2019 showed a much cleaner design, with the various antennas, small air inlets, and exhaust vents removed from its outer mold line. This seems to hold for the second prototype, the surfaces of which are relatively unblemished, at least at the time of the rollout. Although a pair of air-data probes remains, it is likely intended that these would be deleted from production versions. There is also an unusual pair of air inlets atop the primary intake, the purpose of which is unclear, although it isn’t unusual for a stealthy aircraft to have such features. The low-observable qualities of the first prototype Okhotnik were severely compromised by the extensive arrays of antennas and air intakes around the airframe., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The drone is also yet to be fully painted and may eventually adopt the ‘pixelated’ pattern shown on the MAKS model. As it is now, the second prototype reveals distinctive blue/gray colored panels along the leading edges of the wing and the nose. The leading edge of the wing, in particular, is critical for managing low observability, and it’s possible these areas have been treated with radar-absorbent material, or RAM, and/or have radar-wave deadening structures beneath an outer shell that is transparent to certain bandwidths. The ability to embed sensors beneath this outer skin could also be a primary driver on the material used. Overall, the second prototype Okhotnik seems to have achieved, superficially at least, most of the signature-reduction measures that were anticipated by the MAKS model. The most fundamental advance is the exhaust and, as expected, this broadly follows the pattern found on the Boeing X-45A demonstrators. Protruding decking above and below the exhaust will help shield its infrared and radar signatures from most aspects, especially from above and below. The two Boeing X-45A UCAV demonstrators., PHOTO BY DAVID MCNEW/GETTY IMAGES Beyond the deletion of many humps and aerials, overall, this version of the Okhotnik has an outer skin that is more refined, with fewer seams and traditional mechanical fasteners visible. This is similar to the difference we have seen between the T-50 prototypes and the more refined production-representative Su-57s. Taken as a whole, this latest S-70 derivative does seem to represent a leap forward in Russia’s ability to execute on low-observable technologies and manufacturing abilities, even if it still lags behind some of its peers. Still, just rolling out this aircraft does not mean it will all work as advertised. Two very challenging elements of low-observable design, and especially when applied to flying wings, are the exhaust and gathering reliable air data without compromising stealth. So, we will have to wait and see how successful Russia is at making the new exhaust work and eventually deleting the air data probes that severely compromise the Okhotnik’s stealth potential. Making the most of the S-70’s stealth capabilities appears to be a key component in how the type will fit into Russia’s air combat architecture, as we have considered in the past . Ultimately, the aim appears to be to field an Okhotnik UCAV with a substantially low-observable design to compensate for some of the stealthy shortcomings of the Su-57 Felon . This would make more sense bearing in mind the fact that the Okhotnik is supposed to work alongside the Felon as part of a Russian version of the ‘loyal wingman’ concept . It will also be able to work independently, which will also require a greater degree of low observability for many missions than its manned stablemate. The first prototype Okhotnik flies together with a Su-57 for the first time, in September 2019., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE Krivoruchko’s visit to Novosibirsk brought further confirmation that the Okhotnik is intended to operate alongside manned aircraft as well as independently, either alone or as part of a larger formation. “Okhotnik is a highly intelligent system capable of solving a wide range of tasks individually, in a group and together with manned aircraft,” Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti reported , citing the deputy defense minister. In the past, the General Director of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, Yury Slyusar, has described the Okhotnik , which means “hunter” in Russian, as an “attack heavy drone [sic] with unprecedented capabilities, having the largest combat flight range, the widest range of weapons [and] the broadest range of equipment.” There appears to have been some effort already to test weapons from the Okhotnik , using the first flying prototype. Although firm details remain scarce, it was reported in December last year that the UCAV had been flight-tested with some kind of air-to-air missiles . The drone was said to have been outfitted with inert missiles, and it’s unclear if any live missile launches have taken place since. According to today’s RIA Novosti report , the deputy defense minister also held a meeting with NAPO executives about future state contracts. While the facility is also responsible for building Su-34 Fullback tactical bombers for the VKS, in the past, it’s been reported that there are plans to have production versions of the Okhotnik in VKS service by 2024 . That, again, is an ambitious timeline, and during his visit to NAPO Krivoruchko noted that the production of the Okhotnik requires “a full cycle” of development and testing of all components, with most of the parts having been produced specifically for this application, rather than being procured off the shelf. Various new technologies are in the works for the UCAV. These include a new and dedicated ground control station being developed by the Rostec concern. The relatively simple pilot/operator station that has been used in Okhotnik test flight so far., TV ZVEZDA CAPTURE “Technologies tested on the prototypes will be used in the creation of other promising aircraft systems — both manned and unmanned,” Krivoruchko added, perhaps hinting that the design and testing of the Okhotnik could inform Russia’s much-anticipated new strategic bomber , or PAK DA, which is similarly expected to be a flying-wing design. That is, if it ever actually materializes. Even if there is no direct link between the two designs, the development of stealth technologies for the revised Okhotnik will surely be of considerable benefit to the Russian aerospace industry more generally as it continues to work on designs for new-generation combat aircraft . The United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) also foresees the potential for the development of a family of unmanned systems based on the same S-70 design. We look forward to hearing more about this in the future. The Okhotnik is clearly still some way off from frontline service, and the ambitious timelines pitched so far in this regard currently look unlikely to be met. There are still significant hurdles to overcome, including ensuring the UCAV meets its low observable ambitions and works as an effective weapon enabled by command-and-control software and datalink architecture. However, Russia is meanwhile fast gaining useful operational experience with more modest drone designs . Maybe the most remarkable thing about the S-70 is its size — with a reported maximum takeoff weight of around 20 metric tons. This aircraft will have very long endurance with a sizeable combat load. How effectively it can be employed has to be seen. More important, however, is the fact that the Okhotnik UCAV is now demonstrably on the way toward becoming a true low-observable combat aircraft. As such, it will likely break entirely new ground for the Russian military once it finally enters service, and it will very likely be offered for export, potentially bringing these advanced capabilities to other countries, too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 27, 2021",This Is Our First Look At Kratos’ Shadowy New Drone Design For The U.S. Air Force,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kratos has released the first rendering, seen at the top of this story, of the unmanned aircraft it is developing under the U.S. Air Force’s secretive Off-Board Sensing Station program , or OBSS. While details about the drone remain limited, we do know there is a heavy emphasis on scalability, modularity, and affordability , and that it will leverage advanced design and manufacturing concepts to help achieve these goals. There also may be hints as to what it may be intended to do thanks to recent remarks from one of the company’s executives. Breaking Defense was the first to publish the artist’s conception of Kratos’ OBSS design yesterday, along with an interview with Steve Fendley, the President of the company’s Unmanned Systems Division. In October, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) awarded Kratos a contract to build and flight test at least one OBSS prototype. General Atomics also received a functionally identical OBSS contract from AFRL, though the value of their deal was different. After seeing the piece from Breaking Defense , The War Zone reached out to Kratos to see if any additional imagery or other information relating to the company’s OBSS design might now be releasable and was informed that there is not any. From what we can see in the rendering, the drone has a stealthy design with a noticeable continuous chine-line that wraps around the fuselage, as well as a serrated top-mounted air inlet and shrouded engine exhaust. It has a simple swept wing and a broadly splayed v-tail. There are some similarities, especially in the rear two-thirds of the design, to Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie drone , but the OBSS lacks the cranked wing of that design and its tail is differently configured. One of the US Air Force’s XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, another Kratos design., USAF There are very broad echoes in this design of other existing manned and unmanned stealth aircraft. Some examples include the Scaled Composites Model 437 and the Model 401 “Son of Ares” from which it is derived, the General Atomics Avenger , Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray and the designs that had led up to it, and the EADS Barracuda , as well as the lambda-winged Joint Advanced Strike Technology fighter jet concept. The Kratos OBSS design seems to trace some of their broader elements to Northrop’s Tacit Blue stealth demonstrator . However, Tacit Blue featured a complex flush air inlet on top of the fuselage something that is not found on Kratos’ OBSS design. Northrop’s Tacit Blue (aka Whale) demonstrator., DARPA There is no indication, of course, that Kratos’ OBSS drone is directly based in any way on any of these previous designs. The company has previously stressed to The War Zone that this unmanned aircraft is a distinctly new entry in its portfolio, but has so far been unable to provide more specific information about the design’s features or its origins. There are virtually no details available yet about its expected performance or other capabilities, either. In the interview published by Breaking Defense , Fendley, the President of Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, was very careful to speak in generalities, rather than about what OBSS might be capable of specifically. “In general, that’s correct. However, there’s certainly the possibility of having an attritable aircraft carry an exquisite sensor,” Fendley said in response to a question about whether OBSS would carry a basic payload to help keep its costs down and make it less of a problem if it were to be lost on a mission. “For example, we could integrate a $5 million-$10 million sensor on one of our systems. But that specific tail number, in all likelihood, would not be performing an attritable mission, even though technically the expensive sensor would be on an attritable aircraft.” Defining the term “attritable” can be difficult. The War Zone has generally described attritable platforms – drones or anything else – as ones designed with a focus on balancing capabilities against lower costs to produce something capable of performing certain missions in higher-risk environments where commanders might be disinclined to employ a costlier and more technologically advanced asset. Fendley, in this new interview, used a definition of a system that costs “$2 million to $20 million per copy” and “provides a high-performance-versus-cost-system solution that the user can afford to potentially lose at some non-zero rate.” The Kratos’ XQ-58A , which the company has long said it hopes will eventually have a unit cost of around $2 million as production expands, would be at the lower end of that target price range. “The other thing about attritables that’s different from legacy UAS, outfitted with their exquisite sensors, is distributed lethality in the case of weapons and distributed sensing in the case of sensor missions. Maybe you have a very comprehensive sensor capability because you have 10 of these attritable aircraft carrying non-exquisite EO/IR systems, for example,” he continued. “You’re fusing the data you get from those aircraft remotely, and the picture you get is very precise. Now let’s say that three of those aircraft get shot down; you still have a very high-quality picture and good intelligence because you have a seven-sensor baseline instead of just one very expensive sensor. The distributed method helps reduce cost and increase mission effectiveness and survivability.” “Speaking of attritable aircraft generally, not necessarily OBSS, we’re talking about sensor extension and range extension. Let’s say a manned system has particular sensors, such as EO/IR, and the goal is to increase standoff range against a particular threat,” Fendley added when asked to describe a notional OBSS mission. “A handful of attritable aircraft could fly in a teaming formation with a manned aircraft. As the mission progresses, the pilot in the manned aircraft would say, ‘OK, this is as far as I’m going toward the threat because we’re getting close to a contested environment or risk area for me.’ The unmanned aircraft would then be tasked with continuing into the contested environment/risk area and collecting and sharing data to better inform the mission and the warfighter.” Though we can’t say for sure, based on what we know now, one mission set the OBSS platform seems as if it would be particularly well suited to perform would be acting as a distributed sensor network to help manned fighter jets, a possibly other advanced unmanned platforms in the future, find, track, and engage threats . In this role, an OBSS drone could carry an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor system to detect targets passively by their thermal signature, rather than using a radar that could alert opponents to the unmanned aircraft’s presence. Furthermore, IRST systems have the benefit of not being hampered by any radar-absorbing or deflecting qualities found in the design of a stealthy enemy aircraft or missile or by radiofrequency jamming. We know that at least one Kratos UTAP-22 has been flying with what appears to be an IRST system as part of the Air Force’s Skyborg program , which is also managed in part by AFRL. Skyborg is focused on the development of an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain,” along with a suite of associated systems, that will be able to operate semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drones flying networked together with manned aircraft, as well as fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) potentially in the future. Renderings of notional Skyborg-equipped drones that the Air Force has released over the years feature nose-mounted sensors that also appear to be IRST systems , too. General Atomics, the other company involved in the OBSS project, has also test flown Avenger drones with underwing IRST pods during Skyborg tests and as part of other tangential efforts with a clear focus on expanding manned-unmanned teaming capabilities in air-to-air combat scenarios. Having multiple IRST-equipped drones networked together would offer significantly expanded capabilities over a single platform, manned or unmanned, equipped with this kind of sensor system. A single IRST source can determine the bearing of a target, but can have a hard time figuring out how far away it is. Just adding a second IRST source to the mix allows for a more ready determination of the range to a contact via triangulation. Having more sensors only further improves the fidelity of those tracks and expands the total formation’s ability to track many targets at once. Beyond that, relatively small stealthy drones using passive IRST sensor systems could be challenging for an opponent to detect and even more difficult to try to engage, all while they are providing targeting data to other friendly platforms. These drones could be equipped with other sensors instead of IRSTs, too, such as small, but capable radars , or even electronic warfare payloads, allowing for more complex tactics to be put into play, but pushing IRST capability forward over the battlefield seems like the most logical application for such a concept, at least at first. This would drastically enhance the lethality and survivability of manned and unmanned types that such a group of OBSS aircraft would be designed to support. This distributed “off-board” sensor capability is possibly where the name OBSS origniates from. Once again, this is all speculation based on what we know so far. Regardless, there certainly seems to be some kind of sensor in the nose of Kratos’ OBSS design. The artist’s conception is cropped in a way that looks deliberately intended to avoid giving a full look at the front of the drone. On closer inspection, there also appears to be a fairing extending back along the tip of the nose that could further indicate that there is something sticking out of the front. A closer look at the cropped nose section of the artist’s conception of Kratos’ OBSS design, showing a subtle fairing extending back from the tip., Kratos The OBSS program’s biggest focus may well turn out not to be in any particular set of capabilities, but in the design and manufacturing concepts that are employed to build these unmanned aircraft. AFRL has previously said that the project aims “develop and flight demonstrate an open architecture aircraft concept to achieve the goals of rapid time-to-market and low acquisition cost” and that the drones “will be designed for limited life in terms of years, not decades, with no depot maintenance and limited field maintenance considerations.” The contracts the Air Force awarded to Kratos and General Atomics both specifically mentioned “goals of rapid time-to-market and low acquisition cost.” Beyond that, “the demonstration vehicle will incorporate ‘scalable and responsive’ manufacturing techniques, with future variants to be built from a common, government-owned architecture based on emerging requirements,” the introduction to the interview with Fendley on Breaking Defense said. “The category/class called ‘attritable aircraft’ really refers to an affordability objective solution to a UAV problem/need without an expectation for the aircraft to be in service forever,” according to Fendley. “This class seeks an optimization of capability versus cost and life. It’s certainly not the intent to use these assets once and throw them away, but they are also not intended to remain in service for 100 years like the B-52 for example.” “To be suitable for this mission and to meet this need, attritables are made with design and manufacturing tradeoffs that ideally maximize capability in each performance/functional area and throughout the aircraft’s lifetime right up to the knee in the curve where the price would increase substantially versus performance,” he said. “Attritable aircraft provide a mass advantage in conflict, which is commonly assessed as the current need to be able to meet near-peer adversary threats. They solve the mass equation because we can afford to acquire and deploy large numbers of attritables.” This is all very much in line with an in-depth discussion The War Zone had with Fendley back in September about attriable designs, affordability, and future trends in unmanned aircraft development on the sidelines of the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space, and Cyber Conference, which you can find here. Then, as in his new interview published by Breaking Defense , he added that he felt that Kratos was particularly well suited to meet these various intertwined demands. “Kratos’ family of attritable aircraft – the XQ-58A Valkyrie, the UTAP-22 Mako , the Air Wolf , several classified systems, and now, our proposed solution to OBSS – fit at the very low cost end of those ranges,” he told Breaking Defense . “In general, our sweet spot is something that’s in the high-subsonic speed range, high-maneuverability G range, and high survivability with respect to a contested environment. We have absolutely become experts at developing and producing high-performance subsonic, affordable, jet, unmanned aircraft that include a range of autonomy capability.” A briefing slide showing the publicly known members of Kratos’ portfolio, with the exception of its OBSS design. These are broken into aerial targets used for training, research and development, and test and evaluation purposes, and “tactical systems” meant to perform various operational missions. The latter category includes the Airwolf, UTAP-22, and XQ-58A, as well the experimental air-launched and air-recoverable X-61A Gremlins Air Vehicle that Kratos developed as part of a team led by Dynetics for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program. The green arrows point to aircraft made at the company’s manufacturing plant in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma., Kratos “Affordability is what is most essential to enable us to compete with the other primes,” he continued. “As a company, speed, agility, and affordability are our discriminators. Because of our size, selling a number of $1 million or $3 million aircraft a year is a solid business model for us, so we are adequately incentivized even at these price points.” It’s not clear when Kratos’ OBSS design, or the one from General Atomics might fly for the first time, but the contracts from AFRL cover an initial phase of work that ends next October. One company is expected to proceed to the actual flight testing portion of the program after that, with that work continuing into 2024. As the first phase of the OBSS program progresses in the coming year, we may begin to learn more about the project’s overall objectives and the two competing designs.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 14, 2021",The UAE Just Became The Biggest Export Customer For Dassault’s Rafale Fighter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. French aerospace company Dassault Aviation has won a mammoth order from the United Arab Emirates for 80 Rafale multirole fighter jets . The deal was a long time in the making, with Emirati’s interest in the Rafale dating back to at least 2009. France will now toast its success, while a potential order for up to 50 F-35 stealth fighters , transfer of which was proposed under the previous Trump administration, remains in limbo. A contract for the sale of the 80 Rafales was agreed today between Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault, and Tareq Abdul Raheem Al Hosani, CEO of Tawazun Economic Council, which is responsible for security and defense acquisitions on behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Dassault describes the deal as â€œthe largest ever obtained by the French combat aeronautics industry.â€ The total value of the Rafale contract is $16 billion, on top of which will be added weapons for the jets. These deals fall within a larger French arms package for the UAE worth $19 billion that also includes 12 Airbus H225M Caracal military transport helicopters.

Emirati airmen in front of a Mirage 2000-9 at the Dubai Airshow in November 2015., DASSAULT AVIATION As well as the considerable number of jets involved in the latest deal, the United Arab Emirates Air Force and Air Defense (UAEAF&AD) will also become the first export recipient of the F4-standard Rafale. The latest F4 version of the Rafale is part of an ongoing process to continuously improve the fighter and is optimized for networked combat, with new satellite and intra-flight data links, as well as a communication server and software-defined radio. Aside from this, the F4 features upgrades to the radar, electro-optical system, and helmet-mounted display. New weapons are also being integrated, including the forthcoming Mica NG air-to-air missile and the 2,200-pound version of the AASM modular air-to-ground weapon. A video from the French Directorate General of Armaments showing the test campaign for the Rafale F4: The F4 standard is expected to be fully operational by 2024, although some of its functions are planned to become available as early as next year. The contract UAE comes as a boost to the French aerospace industry and the Rafale program in particular, which has now secured six export customers. The previous countries to select the French fighter are Egypt, Qatar , India , Greece , and Croatia . Other potential customers have been linked with the Rafale in the recent past, including Indonesia , although the type was rejected this year by Switzerland in favor of the F-35. Todayâ€™s announcement is not the best news for Lockheed Martin, which had hoped to secure an order from the UAE for its F-35, with a potential sale still in limbo. In October last year, the Trump administration informed Congress that it planned to sell the UAE up to 50 of the stealth fighters, in a move backed by the U.S. State Department. A U.S. Air Force F-35A (right), together with examples of the current UAEAF&AD fighter fleet: the Mirage 200-9 (left) and F-16 (center), after an aerial refueling mission over Southwest Asia in May 2019., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Chris Drzazgowski However, there has always been a question mark if the F-35 sale would make it past U.S. legislators, chiefly amid concerns that it might adversely affect Israelâ€™s so-called â€œqualitative military edgeâ€ in the Middle East. Israel is currently the only F-35 operator in the region. Before President Joe Biden took office some of his representatives had voiced hesitation over how they might handle a possible Joint Strike Fighter deal with the UAE, also due to criticism of the UAEâ€™s role in the civil war in Yemen and also in Libya . â€œThis technology would significantly change the military balance in the Gulf and affect Israelâ€™s military edge,â€ Global Defence Technology quoted the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee as saying last October in response to the planned F-35 sale. â€œThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a game-changing stealth platform boasting advanced strike capability and unique sensor technology . The export of this aircraft requires very careful consideration and Congress must analyze all of the ramifications. Rushing these sales is not in anyoneâ€™s interest.â€ Another potential factor in the issues surrounding the F-35 transfer could be the UAEâ€™s relationship with China. This came to a head earlier this year when Washington apparently applied pressure on the Emiratis to ensure that Beijing halted construction work on a secretive Chinese military facility in the UAE. Despite these hiccups, U.S. officials remained upbeat at the Dubai Air Show last month that the F-35 sale could still be achieved.Â â€œThe F-35 is already in this region, whether itâ€™s Israelis flying the F-35, whether itâ€™s American F-35,â€ Mira Resnick, a deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state in the Biden administration, told the Associated Press . â€œWe would like the UAE to be able to operate the F-35 in a way that [they] can be our security partners and to deter threats, including from Iran.â€ For the time being, however, it seems that a lack of progress on pushing the F-35 deal through may have backfired in Franceâ€™s favor. As it stands, by acquiring 80 Rafales, the UAEAF&AD is essentially securing a long-term replacement for its 56 surviving French-supplied Mirage 2000-9 fighters.Â A UAEAF&AD Mirage 2000-9., Dassault Aviation The serviceâ€™s fighter arm is also equipped with F-16E/F Block 60 Desert Falcons . Although it bought 80 of these, attrition has since reduced that total to 77. The Mirage 2000-9 and the F-16E/F are arguably the most capable variants of these two different multi-role fighters. With major upgrade programs now in the works for both the F-16 and Mirage fleets, itâ€™s likely that the UAEAF&AD will operate three different fighters once the Rafales arrive in service, at least until around 2030. A timeline for their production and delivery has yet to be announced. The launch of the modernization program for the Mirage 2000-9 was announced in November 2019 and itâ€™s valued at $350 million. It will include the replacement of the radar, mission computer, electronic warfare suites, cockpit displays, and helmet-mounted sighting system. Although unconfirmed, the package is thought to include the Thales RDY-3 radar and the same Talios advanced targeting pod as used on the Rafale. Much less is known about efforts to upgrade the F-16E/F fleet. The package, worth $1.65 billion, is addressing â€œobsolescence issuesâ€ in the jet and is known to include a new and faster data processor, together with additional spares and support services. An F-16E Desert Falcon over Arizona, where the 162nd Fighter Wing at Tucson International Airport previously maintained and operated a squadron of Block 60s for training UAEAF&AD personnel., James Haseltine/HIGH-G Productions In the past, the UAE had been looking at the potential purchase of around 60 new fighters, valued at an estimated $6 billion, with candidates including the Rafale as well as the Eurofighter Typhoon . Meanwhile, Russia offered the Sukhoi Su-35 and has more recently sought to get the UAE onboard as an industrial partner for the new Sukhoi Checkmate fighter. The Sukhoi Checkmate during its foreign debut at the Dubai Airshow last month., UAC The Emiratis were apparently in no hurry to select a new fighter type, however, watching as other air forces in the region â€” among them Bahrain , Oman , and Qatar â€” all placed multi-billion-dollar orders for new fighters. Another platform that was on the UAEâ€™s shopping list was the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) MQ-9B Sky Guardian drone. Up to 18 MQ-9Bs had been included together with the planned 50 F-35s and related munitions in a wider arms deal that was valued at up to $23.37 billion. Reportedly, the drones for the UAE were to be equipped with maritime surveillance radar, suggesting they may have actually been the Sea Guardian variant. An MQ-9B test aircraft during trials flown in Greeve earlier this year., GA-ASI The current status of Emirati plans to buy these armed drones is now unclear, with no contracts signed so far. Again, this would have been the first sale of U.S.-made armed drones to a customer in the Middle East, and opposition to the sale from lawmakers was considered likely. Going with the Rafale also allows the country to keep at least part of its fleet outside the reach of U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which many countries find cumbersome and a potential major issue for such a huge investment as a new fighter fleet if the geopolitical winds shift. With the F-16E/F and even a future purchase of the F-35, UAE would still retain a large portion of its tactical fighter fleet that would exist outside this regulatory framework.Â For the time being, at least, France is the winner in the Middle East arms market and it looks like U.S. industry will have to wait a little longer to secure sales of cutting-edge weapons to the UAE. The UAEAF&AD, meanwhile, can look forward to finally getting its hands on new fighter equipment and, in the process, becoming the second biggest Rafale operator, after France.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 2, 2022",U.S. Navy Tests Unmanned Sailboat Off Jordan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has kicked off an operational test of a wind and solar-powered Saildrone Explorer unmanned surface vessel in the Gulf of Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea . Linked into a network that makes use of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, these drone sailboats could be a valuable new tool to help keep an eye out for maritime threats in the region and beyond. Navy personnel assigned to Task Force 59 launched the Saildrone Explorer on its first mission in the region, which is part of a demonstration exercise nicknamed Digital Horizon, from the Royal Jordanian Navy base at the Port of Aqaba on Dec. 12, 2021. The service established this task force within its existing command structure in the Middle East, typically referred to collectively as U.S. 5th Fleet/Naval Forces Central Command, or 5th Fleet/NAVCENT, in September. It is, at present, primarily a testbed unit intended to help rapidly explore the integration of new unmanned and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into Navy operations in the region. U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. 5th Fleet/Naval Forces Central Command, at left, and Jordanian Col. Hisham Khaleel Aljarrah, commander of the Royal Jordanian Naval Force, examine Saildrone Explorer belonging to Task Force 59., USN “These are exciting times for Task Force 59 as we team with the Royal Jordanian Navy to establish our hub for Red Sea operations in Aqaba and deploy some of our new maritime robotics,” Navy Capt. Michael Brasseur, the task force’s commander, said in a statement. “Our Saildrones leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance maritime domain awareness, extending the digital horizon with a sustainable, zero-carbon solution.” Saildrone’s Explorer design , the smallest of the California-headquartered company’s offerings, presents a potentially ideal platform for persistently monitoring littoral and open-ocean areas. Developed initially for collecting various kinds of oceanographic data, the 23-foot-long unmanned vessel uses wind power for propulsion and solar power for its sensor package. Though these drone sailboats have an average speed of only three knots, Saildrone says they have an effectively unlimited range and are designed to operate autonomously for at least a year, even through periods of extreme weather. The actual maximum endurance would be determined by the exact configuration. The Navy has not said what sensors or other systems are on the Explorer that is now taking part in the Digital Horizon demonstration. Saildrone’s website says the electro-optical cameras with some degree of machine learning-enabled automatic target detection, as well as various oceanographic sensors, are available for this design, with radars and other capabilities found on its larger offerings . A group of Saildrones with various full-motion video cameras, including night vision or thermal imaging capable types, networked together and with links to other vessels and command centers ashore, might be useful to the Navy for detecting and tracking threats or potential threats, as well as just improving overall persistent situational awareness within a specific area. Automated target recognition and other capabilities that make use of AI or machine-learning algorithms could add to their utility. These drone sailboats would also be able to provide these kinds of capabilities without the need to deploy significant numbers of more traditional assets or personnel or the costs associated with doing so. Right now, the Navy has a limited capacity to conduct more persistent small boat operations, including surveillance and presence missions, across larger areas. The service is also planning to eliminate its fleets of Mk VI and Cyclone class patrol boats entirely, supplanting them, at least in part, with examples of its two subclasses of littoral combat ships (LCSs). However, LCSs cost tens of millions of dollars to operate and maintain annually. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that Saildrone’s products could be operated for as little as $2,500 per day, or $30,000 per year, for scientific purposes. With all of this in mind, Navy Saildrone Explorer could be a valuable addition to the service’s capabilities in the Gulf of Aqaba, which touches Israel to the north and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula to the west, as well as Jordan to the East. It is an important link to the Red Sea for Israel and Jordan, both for naval operations and commercial shipping, with the Port of Aqaba being the latter country’s only major port facility . The Navy’s Saildrone Explorer out on the water in the Gulf of Aqaba., U.S. Navy It is also a potential chokepoint, something that could be of concern as various types of threats in and around the Red Sea from Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, as well as Iran itself, continue to grow. The Houthis have already demonstrated their proficiency in using unmanned, explosive-laden boats , as well as suicide drones , ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles , and naval mines , to threaten naval vessels , commercial ships , and coastal infrastructure , among other targets, in and around neighboring Saudi Arabia. There have been clear indications that the Houthis, together with Iranian forces themselves , might be working to extend the reach of those threats north, including bringing them within range of southern Israel . Of course, additional persistent maritime situational awareness could be useful elsewhere in the Middle East beyond the Gulf of Aqaba. This includes operations in the Bab Al Mandeb Strait , at the southern end of the Red Sea, and the Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. These are two other highly strategic chokepoints in the region where Iran and its proxies present real threats . Beyond that, it would seem very likely that the outcome of the Digital Horizon demonstration could have implications for how the Navy might deploy these drone sailboats elsewhere around the world. If the testing in the Gulf of Aqaba shows promise, it would not be hard to imagine the service being interested in using Saildrone Explorers for similar missions in broad expanses of the Pacific , among other areas. Task Force 59’s activities in the Middle East are almost certain to have impacts on the service’s larger unmanned plans. This operational test of the Saildrone Explorer is only one example of the work the unit has been doing already since its activation just three months ago. It completed its first unmanned integration exercise in the Persian Gulf back in October. That event saw a Maritime Tactical Systems, Inc., (MARTAC) MANTAS T12 unmanned surface vessel work with Navy and Coast Guard Patrol boats , as well as an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter and a V-Bat drone . Forces from the Bahraini military also participated in the exercise, which was nicknamed New Horizon. The T12 is a speedboat-like unmanned design and the Navy’s example in the Middle East has been seen equipped with a sensor turret containing full-motion video cameras. Task Force 59 has described the 12-foot-long T12 in the configuration they are testing as another potential way to improve “maritime domain awareness,” just as with the Saildrone Explorer. Task Force 59’s MANTAS T12 sails together with the US Coast Guard’s Island class patrol boat USCGC Maui during the New Horizon exercise., USN “This is a significant milestone for our new task force as we accelerate the integration of unmanned systems and artificial intelligence into complex, cross-domain operations at sea,” Capt. Brasseur, Task Force 59’s commander, said in a statement at the conclusion of the New Horizon exercise. “Real-world evaluation is essential.” Earlier this month, Task Force 59 conducted another similar test in the Persian Gulf with a MARTAC Devil Ray T38 unmanned surface vessel. The T38 shares a general shape with the T12, but is significantly larger at 38 feet in overall length. A Devil Ray T38 unmanned surface vessel in the Persian Gulf during a test in December 2021., U.S. Army The Navy, as a whole, is increasingly exploring ways to increasingly integrate unmanned surface vessels of various types , as well as unmanned underwater vehicles and drones , into its concepts of operation. Earlier this year, the service conducted a massive manned-unmanned teaming event, known as Unmanned Integrated Battle Problem 21 , or UxS IBP 21, off that coast of Southern California. UxS IBP 21 featured a variety of different platforms working together to conduct a number of different simulated missions, including the targeting of a mock surface vessel with an SM-6 missile . The Navy plans to conduct more demonstrations like this in the near future. The new test of the Saildrone Explorer in the Gulf of Aqaba, together with the previous operational demonstrations of the T-12 and T-38, shows that Task Force 59 is already conducting important work despite having only been in existence for a matter of months. The unit’s activities are set to help pave the way for increasingly routine use of unmanned platforms for surveillance and other missions in support of Navy operations in the Middle East and beyond.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 4, 2022",Latest AMRAAM Air-To-Air Missile Aims To Keep Pace With China,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The venerable AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM , which got its first kill back in 1992 , is set to get another major boost in capability. Although the U.S. military has a designated successor now in the works, the West’s most popular radar-guided air-to-air missile is about to be fielded in a new iteration, known as F3R. AMRAAMs in this configuration will have an updated guidance section and are optimized for the kind of high-end aerial combat that would ensue if the United States and its allies were ever to go to war with China, according to the missile’s manufacturer Raytheon. Raytheon Missiles & Defense announced officially today that it had completed a series of captive carry flight tests of its latest AMRAAM upgrade, which has been developed under the F3R program, which stands for Form, Fit, Function Refresh. During captive carry testing, the missiles remain attached to a test aircraft throughout the duration of the flight. Such trials are vital for gathering data about how a particular design, as well as the aircraft carrying it, handles the basic stresses of being carried aloft and taken through various maneuvers. The manufacturer describes the captive flights as the “most stressing test to date” for the F3R and the related System Improvement Program, or SIP 3F, software update. An F-35C launches an AIM-120C AMRAAM from its internal weapons bay over a controlled sea test range in the Pacific Ocean., U.S. Air Force/ Christopher Okula The tests were conducted by Raytheon together with the Department of Defense at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, home to the Gulf Range Complex with over 130,000 square miles of training airspace, suitable for live missile shots, including against target drones . You can read more here about how the Air Force uses live missiles to assess how they would function in combat situations. The tests saw instrumented captive versions of the F3R missile carried during “multiple” F-15 , F-16 , and F/A-18 air-to-air intercept missions to prove the weapon works as expected in a realistic environment. Prior to this latest round of trials, there had multiple other captive carry missions as well as two separation launches from a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet . A photo from one of those tests appears at the top of this article. “In addition to allowing for continued AMRAAM production, the F3R program with SIP 3F will deliver significantly enhanced capabilities, enabling the missile to address the rapidly evolving threats we are seeing from our adversaries today,” said Paul Ferraro, vice president of Air Power at Raytheon Missiles & Defense in a statement. “These captive carry flights are essential for assessing the software upgrades’ performance while verifying the missile meets all its aircraft communication interface requirements.” The F3R program has been developed for the existing AIM-120C-8 and AIM-120D-3 AMRAAMs, which already represent the ‘top of the line’ for these missiles. Of these, the D-model already offers some significant advantages, including a two-way datalink with third-party targeting capabilities. It was an AIM-120D that was used for what the Air Force described as the “longest known” air-to-air missile shot during the “long shot” test earlier this year. Maintainers prepare AIM-120D AMRAAMs for carriage by F-15s during a mass aircraft generation exercise at Kadena Air Base, Japan., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Peter Reft Under F3R, Raytheon engineers have used model-based systems engineering initiatives and other digital technologies to upgrade “multiple” circuit cards and hardware into the guidance section of the missiles, replacing the older software. In the past, the Pentagon’s Selected Acquisition Report, or SAR , for AMRAAM described F3R as an update to “mitigate obsolescence issues in the AMRAAM guidance section.” The result is planned not only to boost AMRAAM’s overall capabilities, but ensure it can remain viable while production continues into the next decade for the U.S. military and for export customers , around 40 of which have already ordered different AIM-120 versions, including for ground-based applications . So, what do F3R and SIP 3F specifically add to AMRAAM in terms of improved capabilities? The War Zone asked Raytheon for more details, and they explained: “The new F3R hardware — including circuit cards and guidance section components — allows for significantly enhanced processing power, which SIP-3F leverages for its advanced algorithms. When combined, the hardware and software enhance the missile’s overall effectiveness.” A weapons load crew lifts an inert AMRAAM onto an F-16 at Luke Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Ridge Shan While the F3R version of the missile is not directly linked to the long shot test, which was designed to assess the limits of AMRAAM’s range and performance envelope, Raytheon says that that the trial is indicative of the weapon’s continued advancement. “As F3R and SIP 3F software enter service with the warfighters, the combination of expanded range and improved guidance section performance will give users a big boost in overall capability against long-range threats,” the company told us. As for the “rapidly evolving threats” mentioned by Raytheon’s Paul Ferraro, the company says that these include advanced fighters , cruise missiles , and bombers . They also directed us to the recent quote from the Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall : “If it doesn’t threaten China, why are we doing it?” Clearly, ongoing improvements to the AIM-120 are being driven by the fast-developing military capabilities being fielded by China’s People’s Liberation Army, or PLA. In particular, the company pointed to the enhanced seeker performance that the F3R provides to the AIM-120D-3, which is now better able to target enemy aircraft and missiles in adverse weather, even when threats are employing advanced electronic warfare systems. This is another area where China has made significant strides in recent years, including the development of its J-16D version of the Flanker fighter jet, which is expected to provide longer-range electronic warfare support to tactical aircraft. A recent promotional video from Raytheon includes footage of a separation launch of the latest-generation AMRAAM F3R from a Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet: The push to further enhance this proven air-to-air missile is also an indication that the AIM-120 will be around for many years to come, despite the aim to have the new Lockheed Martin AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile , or JATM, start arming Air Force and Navy aircraft as early as next year. Test work for the JATM program is already well advanced , and the missile is expected to have a greater range than the AIM-120 and performance that at least matches Chinese and Russian efforts in the field of very long-range air-to-air missiles. As well as JATM, there are other long-range air-to-air missile programs in the works, including Raytheon’s own Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW), about which precious little information is available in the public domain. Then there is Boeing’s recently unveiled concept for a two-stage weapon, the Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, which you can read about here . One of the few computer-generated images to have been released showing a concept for the Raytheon LRAAM., US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE VIA FLIGHTGLOBAL.COM Even if the AIM-260 meets its ambitious timeline and starts to be fielded next year, it will be some time before it’s declared fully operational after which production will gather pace. Furthermore, once it appears, JATM may well also not be available for export, at least initially. Having improved AIM-120s will be important both from a capacity standpoint and as a more readily exportable option. Either way, that doesn’t leave an awful lot of time if the most pessimistic predictions of some U.S. military leaders come true. Earlier this year, Admiral Philip Davidson, at the time the commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), warned that China could invade Taiwan within the next six years . Were that to happen, and the United States become involved in a military confrontation with China, then its aircraft — and those of Taiwan — would need every advantage they can get to counter aircraft of the PLA that are increasingly considered able to outrange American fighter jets with their own advanced air-to-air missiles .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A surplus of cash, an empty view lot, and a passion for aviation can lead to some crazy ideas. We have seen a full-on Airwolf replica installed as an art piece atop a mega-mansion and 747 wings being used as a roof on another, but suspending an A-4 Skyhawk attack jet over a massive atrium-like patio is a whole other level of extravagant household aviation art. This is exactly what the owner of 18592 Mesa Drive in Villa Park, California has pulled off. After hearing rumors that an A-4—a legendary carrier-capable Cold War-era aircraft , some of which are still serving in front line and support roles today —was perched within a new mansion overlooking the Santa Ana Valley, I thought there must be plenty about it online. Supposedly it was fully visible in a relatively dense suburban area and it’s not like exotic Orange Country real estate gets underserved by the press. It turns out, there is next to nothing at all on the project or how, and especially why, the A-4 ended up in such a bizarre setting. Was this some sort of aberration? Or maybe it was now enclosed so nobody noticed it in time when it was initially exposed to look into it? With this in mind, we dispatched Matt Hartman , our go-to photographer in Southern California, to investigate. What Hartman found when arriving on the scene was a bizarre, but downright awesome, installation. Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com The home, which is nearing completion, looks ‘hangar inspired,’ and sits atop a bluff among an impressive gaggle of high-priced homes. The A-4 is emblazoned in what appear to be VA-212 markings and is ‘flying’ at a dramatic downward angle that is framed-in perfectly by the structure. Yes, it is crazy, but it is also pretty damn awesome and dare I say it, beautiful? At least in an industrial design sense. That’s not to say it probably hasn’t raised some serious eyebrows amongst its neighbors, especially considering all the attention such a display will garner. It truly is a home unlike any we have seen before. Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Our investigation into this fantastical abode soon led us to its general contractor, Shear Construction . Thankfully its owner answered our call and we were able to get some great details on this incredible mystery mansion. It turns out, the A-4 was bought in Arizona and trucked to Orange County to adorn the 8,000 square-foot mansion. It was disassembled and reassembled in the house’s living room , before it was craned into its current resting place. The extreme structural support requirements, angle at which the aircraft is hung, and many other aspects of the design had to be carefully calculated to avoid catastrophe (think high winds and wings!) and to make the A-4 look as incredible and dramatic as possible. Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Matt Hartman/Thewarzone.com Once the house is finished, which will be this Christmas according to Shear Construction, the A-4 will loom over the mansion’s infinity pool which looks out over an impressive view of the valley below. The owner, who, according to the general contractor, is not an aviator, wanted the A-4 as a major conversation piece, especially to wow folks during fundraisers he likes to throw. We have reached out to the owner, but are still waiting to hear back for more details about his incredible creation. As for the Skyhawk itself, it shows the serial number 154188. This belonged to an A-4F with a rich history serving with the U.S. Navy and USMC, before eventually living out the rest of its active life with the Israeli Air Force, according to warbirdsresourcegroup.org : A-4F Skyhawk/Bu. 154188*1967-68: VA-23 as NM-301. *1969-70: VA-23. *1970: VA-22. *1970-72: VA-127. *1972: VA-212. *1972-73: VMA-223. *10/22/1973: Struck off charge at NARF Norfolk, VA. *10/1973: Transferred to the Israeli AF as 605. *102 Squadron. *147 Squadron. *Put into storage at Ovda AB. The only problem is that the aircraft the serial number is painted on appears to be an earlier model, such as an A-4E, so we can’t confidently provide a history for it at this time. Painting a display aircraft in markings it never wore operationally is hardly a rare occurrence. So that’s everything we know about the ‘Skyhawk House’ at this time. It has to stand as one of the greatest aviation aficionado dwellings of all time. It really is amazing they pulled off such a seemingly strange idea so well.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The badly damaged Seawolf class nuclear fast-attack submarine USS Connecticut (SSN-22) has just appeared in San Diego after making a covert transit from Guam, all but certainly sailing the entire way on the surface. It had been staged on that island for around two months following its collision with an underwater seamount in the South China Sea on October 2nd, 2021. Thanks to our friends at @Warshipcam who spotted and identified the submarine entering San Diego Bay on the local San Diego Webcam , we also get a far clearer look at the damage done to the prized submarine—its entire bow sonar dome is indeed missing . We have more or less known that Connecticut had left Guam for many days now as the sub had not appeared in satellite imagery at its previous berth in Guam . We reached out to the Navy for information as to its whereabouts, but we did not receive a response, which further pointed to it being on a secretive surface transit across the Pacific. We had thought Connecticut’s most likely destination would have been its home in Bremerton, Washington. That is where the three Seawolf class submarines are based. Navy statements also supported that assumption. But now we know San Diego was where it was headed, at least first. Washington state is 5,600 miles from Guam direct. San Diego is farther at 6,200 miles, but the course to San Diego takes it close to islands where it could abort its voyage to safely, namely Hawaii. One of the Navy’s master submarine bases is in San Diego at Point Loma. It’s possible, if not probable, that it could still travel to Washington after this stop. The reason it didn’t stay in Guam is that there is no drydock there to make any sort of significant repairs to the vessel. Pearl Harbor is the closest location with such capabilities, but considering there are only three boats in the Seawolf class, it may have been a challenge for it to take on such a unique repair job. Its drydock facilities are also extremely heavily tasked and are a strategic asset in the Pacific that would have had their capacity decreased, possibly for years, if Connecticut called on it to repair its damage. A 6,200 mile surface transit in a submarine that is damaged and doesn’t even have a bow sonar dome must have been extremely unpleasant. We also don’t know what sort of escorts Connecticut must have had for her trans-Pacific transit. We have reached out to the Navy for comment and will update this post as soon as we hear back. UPDATE: This is all the Navy was willing to convey to us in response to our questions about Connecticut’s journey: USS Connecticut (SSN 22) is in port in San Diego. The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. Thank you, Cindy CDR Cindy Fields Force Public Affairs Officer Commander, Submarine Force U.S. Pacific Fleet It’s also worth mentioning that the destroyer USS Mustin arrived in San Diego not long after USS Connecticut . It’s possible that she provided security for the stricken submarine on at least part of its voyage. Mustin left San Diego on November 26th and was in Pearl Harbor on December 1st, so the dates seem to line up. Still, U.S. warships can make this transit for a number of reasons.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 14, 2021",F-35s Could Get New Engines As Soon As 2027,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Congress could be able to require the U.S. military to prepare a pair of studies about what it would take to put new engines into current and future F-35 stealth jets later in this decade. There is an entirely new powerplant under development under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program, or AETP , with multiple prototypes being tested already. The hope is that the AETP engine or some other alternative would bring a significant performance boost to all three variants of the F-35, as well as offer improved efficiencies. Writing in Air Force Magazine yesterday, John Tirpak pointed to the wording in the most recent draft of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2022 Fiscal Year. The bill, which has still yet to pass in the Senate , would require the Secretary of the Air Force, working with Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, to lay out a plan for adding AETP engines to F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft starting no later than 2027. The Secretary of the Navy, together with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, would produce a similar, but separate plan for adding an “advanced propulsion system” – which could be the final AETP design or an enhanced version of the existing Pratt and Whitney F135 – to F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) and F-35C carrier-based variants, again starting in 2027 at the latest. The business end of the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine powering a U.S. Air Force F-35A., U.S. Air Force In both cases, the outlined “competitive acquisition strategy” would cover adding AETP engines to existing and new production aircraft. Both reports would have to be submitted within two weeks of the delivery of President Joe Biden’s proposed the Fiscal Year 2023 budget request to Congress. The costs involved in integrating any new powerplants into all three variants of F-35 could be considerable. For the Air Force in particular, which is the largest current U.S. operator of Joint Strike Fighters of any type, there is certainly a question about whether the service has the means to give all of its existing and future jets entirely new AETP engines. There are already separate concerns about the expenses involved in sustaining existing F-35As, as well as bringing them to the latest Block 4 standard that includes enhanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities , plus the ability to carry new weapons . In the past, Lt. Gen. Eric T. Fick, the Program Executive Officer for the F-35 Joint Program Office, has said that the Air Force would have to cover the development and production costs of integrating the AETP engine in the F-35A. Right now, prototypes of two options for the AETP, the General Electric XA100 and Pratt & Whitney XA101 , are being tested. Both of these powerplants are expected to increase the range of the jet by around 30 percent, and persistence by some 40 percent, achieved by cutting fuel burn by around a quarter. Currently, the F-35A has an unrefueled range in the region of 1,350 miles, which would be increased to around 1,800 miles with the new engine. The acceleration would also be improved with the new engine installed. The ‘Adaptive’ part of the name refers to the fact that these new engines combine the fuel economy of the kinds of turbofans used in new-generation airliners with the high-pressure compression normally found in fighter engines. By introducing a third stream of air, this can be dynamically modulated between the engine’s core and the bypass stream, to provide increased thrust during combat conditions and increased fuel efficiency during cruise conditions. Schematic illustration of an Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) design., U.S. Air Force U.S. Air Force The XA100 from GE., General Electric In particular, giving the F-35A longer legs is something that would be of huge benefit to the Air Force, as it looks toward the likelihood of the next major conflict taking place in the Asia Pacific theater , where the Lightning II’s limited range would be a major concern. As the service plans for its next fighter, an increased range has already been earmarked as a ‘must-have’ feature. Not only would a longer-range F-35A be more suitable to operations in the Asia Pacific region, but it would also reduce dependency on aerial tankers. The availability of sufficient inflight refueling aircraft has always been a key factor for air combat planners. More recently, however, the survivability of those same tankers has become a real worry, with interest in more survivable tankers, achieved through low observability or through other means . An F-35A approaches a KC-135 Stratotanker during aerial refueling near Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. , U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. John Nimmo As well as improving all-around capabilities, a new powerplant would address an ongoing problem with excessive wear to the heat-protective coating on the F-35A’s turbine rotor blades. Earlier this year it emerged that 46 of the jets were without functioning engines due to the issue. With the engine maintenance center facing a backlog on repair work, frontline F-35 fleets have been hit, and the Air Force’s fleet has suffered the most significant availability shortfall. In the recent past , Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. has also noted that the F135 engines are “failing a little faster in certain areas,” as a result of heavy usage and regular deployments . While changes to maintenance are being looked at, Brown also suggested that one solution to the issue may simply be to use the F-35 less—hardly an ideal solution in the long term. Two U.S. Air Force F-35As at an “undisclosed location” in the Middle East last year, demonstrating their ability to rapidly shift assets within the region to respond to emerging contingencies., U.S. Air Force While the timeline for the new engine is bold, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney have told Air Force Magazine that the 2027 target date is achievable. The members of Congress who put together the most recent NDAA appear to be extremely supportive of the adaptive engine program, with the bill proposing to triple its funding in the 2022 Fiscal Year over what had originally been requested. At the same time, while members of Congress are pushing for adding the AETP engine to the F-35A, the draft NDAA leaves open the possibility of going in a different direction with the F-35B and F-35C. The study for the F-35B and F-35C would include an “analysis of the impact on combat effectiveness and sustainment cost from increased thrust, fuel efficiency, and thermal capacity for each variant of the F-35, to include the improvements on acceleration, speed, range, and overall mission effectiveness, of each advanced propulsion system.” There is no specific mention of AETP. The demands of the aircraft carrier operating environment for the F-35C and, above all, the swiveling nozzle and integrated lift engine for the STOVL F-35B mean the challenges of integrating a new engine are greater. Indeed, in the past, both General Electric and Pratt & Whitney have said their AETP designs are not compatible with the F-35B. With that in mind, the NDAA may be expecting the B-model to use the enhanced F135 engine, while the F-35C gets either the same or a version of the new AETP powerplant. An F-35B lands aboard USS America (LHA 6) in the South China Sea., Sgt. Audrey Rampton/U.S. Navy The Navy report is also to provide an assessment of how an advanced propulsion system could reduce aerial tanking requirements, and any “overall cost benefit” from “reduced acquisition and sustainment.” Once the two reports are prepared, Congress will have a schedule “annotating pertinent milestones and yearly fiscal resource requirements for the implementation of such a strategy.” With an average price tag of $20 million for the current F135, it might be expected that the new engine will be substantially more than that. Should Congress consider that the re-engining scheme is worth pursuing, it’s not clear what the next step would be. Early in the Joint Strike Fighter program, there were two engines, the F135 and General Electric/Rolls-Royce’s alternative F136, although the latter was dropped on cost grounds, somewhat controversially . A General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine is tested at maximum thrust conditions., Rick Goodfriend It could be that the Air Force has learned from that lesson and will decide that the XA100 and XA101 should both proceed to production, after which they can compete to win contracts, perhaps to power the F-35, or other platforms. For the F-35, of course, the AETP could still prove to be ‘an engine too far.’ At that point, Pratt & Whitney would be well-positioned to pitch its improved F135 engine , which also promises improvements to thrust and efficiency, but which the company says would be much cheaper than AETP technology. With a substantial production run ahead of it for both the U.S. Department of Defense and foreign customers, it makes sense for the Joint Strike Fighter’s powerplant to keep pace with technological developments in the same way that other aspects of the jet are enhanced via upgrades and new iterations. But whether the Air Force, let alone other operators can foot the bill for integrating this promising new engine technology into the already costly F-35 is currently questionable.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 3, 2023",Australia Has Had Enough Of Its Dysfunctional MRH90 Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The sorry saga of the NHIndustries MRH90 battlefield utility helicopter in Australian military service is seemingly coming to an abrupt end. The helicopter, known to the Australian Army as the Taipan, after a deadly venomous snake, has proven to be impossible to operate effectively and the government has instead decided to look at replacing it with the UH-60M Black Hawk . Ironically, it was older Black Hawks, among other types, that the MRH90 had originally been intended to supersede, but the program has never been far from trouble since service entry in 2007. Australian Minister for Defense Peter Dutton took to Twitter this morning to confirm that Australia was finally giving up on the MRH90. “This morning I announced the Morrison government’s decision to strengthen the Australian Army’s helicopter capability by formally requesting advice from the U.S. on the acquisition of up to 40 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters to replace the MRH90 Taipans,” he wrote. An Australian Army MRH90 provides support to the New South Wales government following a request for assistance in response to flooding across the state., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE Further detail behind the decision was provided in a statement from the government, which noted that “the MRH90 helicopter fleet has not met contracted availability requirements nor the expected cost of ownership ahead of its planned withdrawal from service in 2037.” A new date for its retirement has not yet been provided, but Dutton had said that he wants the new type to be introduced “over the next couple of years.” “The performance of the MRH90 Taipan has been an ongoing and well-documented concern for [the Australian Ministry of Defense] and there has been a significant effort at great expense to try to remediate those issues,” Dutton added. “It is critically important there is a safe, reliable, and capable utility helicopter available for our servicemen and women into the future, with reasonable and predictable operating costs.” “The Black Hawk is so much cheaper on a per-hour basis to run than the existing Taipan,” Defense News reports Dutton as having said. “The Taipan is unreliable, there’s a lot of money that’s spent on maintenance and a lot of downtime of our pilots and aircrews who should be up training and they should be flying these helicopters, and at the moment, in many cases, they just can’t.” Australian Minister of Defense Peter Dutton visits Sydney’s Victoria Barracks on December 10 to make his announcement about the future of Australian Defence Force aviation capability. Pointedly, two Australian Army S-70A-9 Black Hawks flew into Victoria Barracks for his announcement., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE At this point, Australia has only requested information from the U.S. government on the UH-60M as an alternative to the MRH90, although it seems fairly obvious the fate of the Taipan is now sealed. Furthermore, it’s been said that the new Black Hawk would provide savings to the taxpayer of around US$1.8 billion through 2037. While reduced operating costs is good news, the addition of new versions of the tried and tested UH-60 to the Australian Army fleet is ultimately an embarrassing climbdown for the Australian Ministry of Defense after investing around US$3 billion in the MRH90 program. After all, the Taipan was acquired with the claim that it would be superior to the 1980s-era Black Hawks that it replaced. An Australian Army S-70 Black Hawk preparing to lift off at Shoalwater Bay Training Area during exercise Talisman Saber 07., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE Meanwhile, the six MRH90s operated by the Royal Australian Navy, or RAN, are also being lined up for replacement. These helicopters are used for maritime support, but the U.S. State Department has already approved the potential sale of 12 more MH-60R Seahawks as potential successors to the naval-tasked MRH90s. The MRH90 is an Australian-specific derivative of the NH90, developed in Europe by the multinational NHIndustries company, which comprises Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo, and GKN Fokker. NH90s have been ordered in multiple land-based and maritime versions by 14 different countries and total deliveries to date stand at 446, according to the manufacturer’s website. Australia acquired a total of 46, for both the Army and RAN, which share a pooled fleet. The NH90 can cruise at 162 knots and carry up to 20 troops, while the latest UH-60M version of the Black Hawk cruises at 151 knots and usually transports around 11 fully equipped soldiers. As The Strategist , the analysis and commentary site from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , or ASPI, observes, “on paper, the MRH90 has more capacity than the Black Hawk, in real life that’s irrelevant if the helicopter isn’t flying.” But it wasn’t capabilities alone that saw Canberra originally select the MRH90, in favor of — you guessed it — the UH-60M, despite apparent Defense Forces’ preference for the Black Hawk. However, the MRH90 came with significant benefits for local industry, including through local assembly, whereas the American product would likely have been bought off the shelf. An MRH90 operated by the Australian Army Aviation Test and Evaluation section conducts a demonstration of live-firing of flares at Brymaroo airfield in Queensland., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE Ultimately, despite the benefits of those offsets, a catalog of problems with the type means the MRH90 means has been on the government’s projects of concern watchlist since 2011. In fact, the situation has gotten worse, not better, with the helicopter’s per-hour operating cost rising from $35,000 to last year’s $50,000. One particular difficulty has been in adapting the MRH90 for Army special forces support, a critical mission that’s conducted in addition to its regular utility role. As a result of delays in modifying the helicopters for special forces work, the Army was forced to fly the older Black Hawks even longer than planned, with the final examples to be retired by the end of this year. As to why the ax has fallen on the MRH90 now, ASPI relates that decision to the changing strategic environment that Australia now faces as regards China. Having major programs fail to deliver what they promised is no longer an option as Canberra seeks to have a more accountable and efficient military at its disposal. That also implies buying new hardware quicker when it’s needed — like the UH-60M — and increased defense budgets are better able to absorb this. Growing defense budgets are also being driven by the perceived Chinese threat but, at the same time, there is also more money to go around due to underspending over the last year or so, due to the impact of COVID-19 on industry and supply chains. The MRH90 decision also follows the decision by the previous Australian government to replace its Airbus Helicopters Tiger Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters (ARH) with AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters, so is yet another blow to European helicopter industries in Australia. Australian Army ground crew rearm Tigers ARH at an air-deployed ground refuel point, during Exercise Griffin Eagle in Arizona, United States., COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE As well as the Tiger ARH, Australia showed a similar willingness to simply drop underperforming defense programs earlier this year when it walked away from plans to buy French-designed Attack class submarines and instead look to the United States and the United Kingdom to develop a nuclear-powered submarine capability. That decision enraged France, which was caught off guard by Canberra’s decision to team up with the United States and the United Kingdom as a new strategic alliance, under the AUKUS agreement , with a focus on addressing threats in the Asia Pacific region. Then, outside of Australia, it should be noted that other NH90 operators have faced a variety of problems with the helicopter, although these issues have rarely been consistent, especially since individual variants — more than 20 in all — can differ from country to country. Examples include Germany, where the Army’s helicopters have been revealed to have rear ramps too weak to support fully equipped soldiers, cabin floors that can be damaged by combat boots, among other faults. At one point in 2019, as we reported, only around 12 percent of Germany’s NH90s were mission-capable, with the German Armed Forces blaming Airbus for alleged failings in its maintenance services. A German Army NH90 is loaded aboard an An-124 strategic airlifter at Leipzig/Halle Airport for transport to Mali, in 2017., Bundeswehr/Mario Bähr Earlier this week It was confirmed that Norway has issued a request for information (RFI) for alternatives to its NH90s that are not able to meet all of the requirements of the country’s coast guard. With the writing on the wall for Australia’s relationship with the MRH90, it might be tempting to see the decision to ditch it in favor of a likely UH-60M buy as another facet of AUKUS and the pivot away from European suppliers to the United States. However, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was today keen to stress that his country “will continue to work with many other defense contractor suppliers, but in this case, sadly the Taipans didn’t do what we needed them to do, so we’ll get the things that we need to do it.” Buoyed by healthier defense budgets, Australia is now in a position to do what it probably would have liked to do some years ago — abandon its troublesome and costly MRH90 fleet in favor of something tried and tested.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A total of 24 helicopters that once belonged to the defunct Afghan Air Force are now at the U.S. military’s main aircraft boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Over the past few weeks, an additional four Russian-made Mi-17 Hip transports and 17 MD 530F Little Bird armed light helicopters have joined the three Mi-17s that arrived last month. The War Zone was first to report on the delivery of that initial trio. Air Force Materiel Command’s (AFMC) public affairs office provided this update on how many ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft are at the boneyard to The War Zone . AFMC had previously explained that the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Management Office-Afghanistan, which is headquartered in Qatar, is overseeing the consolidation of these airframes at Davis-Monthan. An Mi-17 Hip helicopter bound for Afghanistan is loaded into a cargo plane in 2018., US Army It is not clear how many former Afghan Air Force Mi-17s, MD 530Fs, or other types that had belonged to that service the U.S. military ultimately plans to relocate to Arizona. As of July, the month before the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban , the Afghan Air Force had 13 Mi-17s and 49 MD 530Fs, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. government watchdog. A table offering a summary of the Afghan Air Force’s inventory based on data available to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) as of July 2021., SIGAR However, at that same time, SIGAR acknowledged that this was not necessarily a complete accounting of the full Afghan inventories of either of those helicopters. For instance, the Afghan military’s Special Mission Wing, a separate, secretive special operations aviation unit — data about which remains classified — operated at least some number of Mi-17s. Furthermore, SIGAR subsequently said that at least six helicopters, a mixture of both Hips and UH-60A+ Black Hawks , were overseas undergoing maintenance at the time of the Taliban takeover. Afghan media reports had suggested the total number of Afghan Air Force aircraft being repaired in other countries might have been as high as 25, according to the watchdog. In addition, satellite imagery that The War Zone had obtained from Planet Labs in August showed at least 19 Mi-17-type helicopters at Termez Airport in Uzbekistan, where various Afghan Air Force aircraft had fled in the face of the Taliban conquest. While it was later determined that some of the Hips at Termez belonged to the Uzbek government, the bulk of them did not. Other ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft escaped to Tajikistan , but Mi-17s or any other kinds of helicopters do not appear to have been among them. The Taliban is known to have captured at least 12 more Mi-17s, in various states of airworthiness , as well. All this makes clear that the total number of Hips alone in the Afghan military’s inventory prior to its collapse was clearly significantly higher than SIGAR had previously reported and otherwise calls into question the completeness of the data available to them. A satellite image showing various ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft, including Mi-17 helicopters, at Termez Airport in Uzbekistan in August 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Regardless, it is clear the U.S. government continues to be under immense pressure to recover as many ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft of all types as possible, or otherwise prevent the repatriation of any airframes that are still in other countries back to the current Taliban-controlled government of Afghanistan. The total number of former Afghan aircraft in storage at Davis-Monthan is likely to grow even further in the near term. The 24 helicopters there now could eventually be joined by some number of Black Hawks. It is somewhat curious that no UH-60s have arrived the boneyard already. This raises the possibility that those aircraft might be going to wherever the U.S. military is storing dozens of other examples that were earmarked for the Afghan Air Force, but never delivered. SIGAR previously reported that 37 Black Hawks that had been destined for Afghanistan were still at an unspecified location in the United States when the country’s government collapsed in August. Portions of that service’s fixed-wing inventory, which included A-29 light attack aircraft , AC-208 armed light utility planes , Cessna 208 Caravan small transports, and Pilatus PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, could make their way to Arizona, too. What might happen to any of the aircraft that ultimately end in the boneyard remains to be seen. By and large, the Afghan Air Force operated types that are not in widespread U.S. military service. That being said, Mi-17-type helicopters are notably in use by highly secretive U.S. military special operations units and the Central Intelligence Agency . These organizations could be interested in acquiring some of these former Afghan examples. There have been reports that President Joe Biden’s administration has been considering transferring some to the Ukrainian military , which operates Hips , as part of possible new military aid packages to that country as it faces the prospect of a new large-scale Russian invasion . In recent years, the U.S. military has been heavily promoting MD 530 variants as options for allies and partners looking to acquire armed light helicopters through established foreign assistance mechanisms, such as the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process. Lebanon, for example, just recently began taking delivery of a fleet of MD 530Fs via FMS that are set to become part of a special operations aviation element in that country. So, the former Afghan Air Force helicopters could very well end up resold to other countries. With no ex-Afghan fixed-wing types delivered to the boneyard yet, it’s harder to speculate about the future of any such aircraft, but A-29s and Cessna 208 Caravan variants have also been popular options for sale through FMS and other U.S. foreign security assistance programs. Afghanistan’s PC-12NGs, all of which were operated by the Special Mission Wing, were supplied in a sensitive configuration the exact capabilities of which remain something of a mystery. This could make transferring those aircraft to other allies or partners a more complex affair. In the end, at least some of the ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft that the U.S. government recovers may just end up disappearing into obscurity at the boneyard, which is already home to hundreds of other aircraft that will likely never fly again.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2021",Here’s How Finland Justified Its Decision To Buy 64 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s now official: Finland has chosen the F-35A Block 4 multirole fighter to replace its current fleet of 62 upgraded F/A-18C/D “legacy” Hornets . As part of the HX competition, the Nordic country has confirmed that it plans to buy 64 examples of the Joint Strike Fighter, plus armament, training, maintenance, and other services, with deliveries of the jets scheduled to begin in 2025. You can read our previous reporting on the F-35 and HX here . Finnish Minister of Defense Antti Kaikkonen announced the decision in an event today that was broadcast live on YouTube . This now clears the path for the Finnish Defense Forces to enter a procurement agreement with the U.S. government. The selection of the F-35 had been widely anticipated, following a report in the Finnish press last week, but until now, the Ministry of Defense had declined to comment. The HX tender was decided based on certain core decision areas: military capability, security of supply, industrial cooperation, and procurement and life-cycle costs. Only after a candidate met the requirements for the security of supply, industrial cooperation, and cost elements of the tender did it progress to a military performance comparison in which it went head-to-head against other successful candidates. Compared to the rival Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , Dassault Aviation Rafale , Eurofighter Typhoon , and the Saab Gripen E , the F-35 was judged the best in terms of combat and reconnaissance capabilities — the type is uniquely capable of collecting and geolocating various forms of electronic intelligence, which you can read all about here , as well as radar and limited optical/infrared intelligence — and survivability . Not only did the Finnish government determine the F-35 is the most capable of these fighters today, but it also scored higher in terms of development potential, up until at least 2060. Even taking into account the challenging operating environment and requirements in Finland, including dispersed operations from highway strips, the F-35 was considered the best option. This is a puzzling claim that we are eager to hear more about in regards to how it was figured. The Saab Gripen, in particular, was designed specifically for these types of operations, for instance. Particular aspects of the F-35 that the Air Force singled out for praise were its situational awareness and ability to share targeting data with other platforms, as well as its stealth characteristics and its sensors, all of which are internal, rather than podded. The endurance of the F-35 was also praised in the Finnish competition, with the jet having the largest internal fuel capacity of the entrants and not needing external fuel tanks . What is perhaps most surprising about the news is not that Helsinki opted for the F-35 — the advantages of which for Finland, in particular, we have discussed in detail — but the fact that the Joint Strike Fighter was considered the most cost-effective option given the framework Finland was judging from. F-35A and F/A-18C jet fighters operate from Tampere-Pirkkala Air Base in Finland during the flight-test phase of the HX competition: The tender confirmed that the F-35 operating and maintenance costs, as well as the expenses associated with lifecycle development, all fit within the planned budget. “The F-35 solution, adapted to the given financial framework, was the most cost-effective,” the Finnish Air Force declared in a statement . “The F-35 was the cheapest in terms of purchase price… The operating and maintenance costs of the system are below the set annual cost limit of 254 million Euros [around $286 million at the current rate of exchange]. The operation and lifecycle development of the F-35 is possible with the resources of the Defense Forces. None of the bids were significantly cheaper in terms of operating and maintenance costs.” Already, some are questioning exactly how Finland determined the set annual cost limit, and why it is apparently so low: As well as capabilities and costs, the evaluation determined that the F-35 met the requirements for the security of supply. This is especially important for Finland, as a non-NATO nation, to ensure the continuity of operations in times of crisis, for example. In addition, the F-35 offer includes “significant industrial co-operation, which is especially related to the ability to operate independently in exceptional circumstances.” Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government seem to have specifically tailored the F-35 offering to meet Finnish security of supply requirements. Maintenance of the jets, for example, “is based on a solution modified from [the Joint Strike Fighter] global maintenance system,” while certain critical maintenance capabilities become the responsibility of the Finnish Defense Forces and local industry. “The solution includes service capabilities to be built in Finland, exclusive spare parts and replacement equipment under Finnish national control and participation in a multinational service network.” By the sound of it, Finland’s domestic support capacity for the F-35 will be among the most substantial anywhere outside the United States, perhaps only behind that of Israel, which is very well set up to operate the jet independently . The F-35 met industrial cooperation requirements, which again called for direct industrial cooperation to help make the country (more) independent when it comes to maintaining the jets. The most important elements of the industrial cooperation agreement will be “large-scale production of F-35 front [fuselage] frames in Finland for other users as well, the production of structural components, and the ability to test and maintain equipment.” “The F-35 will provide Finnish industries unique digital capabilities that leverage fifth-generation engineering and manufacturing,” Bridget Lauderdale, Lockheed Martin’s vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, said in a statement . “The production work will continue for more than 20 years, and the F-35 sustainment work will continue into the 2070s.” A final engine assembly project for Finnish aircraft is also being offered in Finland, as part of an industrial cooperation agreement to be signed between the Finnish Ministry of Defense, Lockheed Martin, and engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. The Air Force also pointed to the benefits of commonality that will come from F-35 fleets in Denmark and neighboring Norway, as well as the wider Joint Strike Fighter operating community. The Air Force noted that “it has been possible to agree on several special security of supply requirements that are crucial from Finland’s point of view.” Finnish F/A-18s share ramps space with a Norwegian F-16 at Bodø Main Air Station, Norway, during the Arctic Challenge Exercise in 2015., Forsvaret Under current plans, the Finnish Air Force will begin to dispose of its current Hornet fleet in 2025, at the same time that it receives its first F-35s, as part of the training of Finnish personnel in the United States. The goals are for the first F-35 to arrive in Finland in 2026 and for the type to have fully replaced the Hornet by 2030. A Finnish F/A-18C takes fuel from a U.S. Air Force KC-135 during training in Finland., PUBLIC DOMAIN As well as the planned 64 F-35As, in the latest Block 4 configuration , Finland will pick from an assortment of weaponry, based on what is considered best suited to the operating environment. The F-35 offers included the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile ( AMRAAM ), AIM-9X Sidewinder , Small Diameter Bomb I and II (SDB I and II, the latter also known as Stormbreaker ), Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) family, Joint Strike Missile ( JSM ), and the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range cruise missile, or JASSM-ER . So what will it all cost? Finland has earmarked total funds of 10 billion Euros or around $11.3 billion for the HX project. So far, the Finnish parliament has approved an order for 9.4 billion Euros ($10.6 billion) for the project and a five-year transfer appropriation of 579 million Euros ($653 million). So far, the acquisition is worth around 8.378 billion Euros ($9.4 billion), of which the jets themselves account for fighters account for 4.703 billion Euros ($5.3 billion) — providing an equivalent cost-per-jet of around $82 million. On top of this, 754.6 million Euros ($852 million) has been allocated for AMRAAM and Sidewinder missiles. The remaining 2.92 billion Euros ($3.3 billion) covers maintenance equipment, spare parts, training equipment, and other systems and services between 2025 and 2030. F-35 maintainers from both the U.S. Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force work together at Orland Air Base, Norway, to turn two American jets after a sortie in 2019., U.S. Air Force/ Master Sgt. Austin M. May The cost of infrastructure to operate the jets in Finland, including runways, hangarage, management systems, and staff, is put at 777 million Euros ($878 million), while 823.8 million Euros ($930 million) has been set aside for subsequent contracts and contract amendments. That is expected to include the remaining weapons and future contract changes. Whether all those figures will stand the test of time remains to be seen, of course, but the fact they have been published by the Finnish Ministry of Defense speaks to the openness of the HX competition. They will no doubt be of great encouragement to Lockheed Martin and the F-35 Joint Program Office, especially as they show — on paper, at least — that, based on the Finnish metrics, the jet comes out more cost-effective than rival fourth-generation fighters. The result, and the numbers, will be especially galling to Saab, perhaps, which has long campaigned its Gripen E — pitched to Finland in a package with the GlobalEye radar plane — on the basis of its affordability. With only the F-35 and the Gripen E now left in the running for the Canadian fighter competition , the Swedish manufacturer will have a lot of work to do to turn the tables on its American rival.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 3, 2022",Stratolaunch To Build Aerial Target For U.S. Hypersonic Defense Testing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Stratolaunch, the owner and operator of the massive Roc , the largest plane ever flown , has received a contract from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to supply a target that mimics certain hypersonic threats to support the development of new defensive capabilities. Hypersonic weapons present significant challenges for defenders in terms of detecting and tracking incoming threats, as well as attempting to intercept them . Being able to test new sensors and interceptors against real representative targets will be essential going forward. Stratolaunch announced its deal with Missile Defense Agency (MDA) yesterday, but provided only limited details about the expected work. An artist’s conception of the Talon-A, a resuable, air-launched hypersonic vehicle that Stratolaunch is developing., Stratolaunch “We’re excited to provide MDA with a threat-representative and threat-replicating target that allows them to understand how to engage and intercept hypersonic threats,” Dr. Daniel Millman, Chief Technology Officer of Stratolaunch, said in a statement contained in a company press release. “The company plans to augment existing Department of Defense flight test resources through affordable, commercially contracted, rapid-turnaround hypersonic flight testing for the Department of Defense and its prime contractor partners,” that same release added. This MDA contract is exactly the kind of work that Stratolaunch had said publicly back in December 2019 that it would start to seek out . That had represented a change in direction away from the firm’s original focus on space launch services , with the Roc serving as a mothership for air-launching various expendable and reusable vehicles to put payloads into space. The shift to high-speed flight testing services had come after the company was sold to Cerberus Capital Management following the death of the company’s founder, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, in 2018. It’s not clear from Stratolaunch’s press release whether the target it will provide to MDA will be an entirely new development or one based on an existing design the company has been working on. The firm did announce the completion of a Critical Design Review of its Talon-A hypersonic test vehicle design in September and said that the goal was to conduct the first flight test of one of those vehicles next year. Separate testing is also ongoing to prepare the Roc, which was developed and built for Stratolaunch by Scaled Composites, a Northrop Grumman company, for its role as the launch platform. Talon-A is a resuable, unmanned vehicle with various modular payload spaces to support various flight test activities. It is expected to be able to reach speeds of at least Mach 6, with hypersonic speed being defined as anything above Mach 5. The Talon-A, which is 28 feet long and has a wingspan of just over 11 feet, is a powered glider-type vehicle that uses a liquid fuel rocket motor to help propel it to the desired speed after launch. After completing its mission, it is designed to land on a conventional runway using its tricycle landing gear. A rendering of Talon-A with its landing gear down., Stratolaunch A graphic depicting, in very broad strokes, the basic profile of launches of Talon-A vehicles from the Roc., Stratolaunch Stratolaunch is also working on a similar, but larger vehicle called Talon-Z, as well as a spaceplane called Black Ice that could be configured to carry cargo, and even possibly passengers. The Talon-A design, or a derivative thereof, could be viable for use as a surrogate for hypersonic weapons that use unpowered boost-glide vehicles, such as Russia’s Avangard or China’s DF-17 . North Korea also claimed to have tested a weapon of this type earlier this year. The mysterious fractional orbital bombardment system-like weapon that China has been testing recently appears to use some kind of hypersonic glider, as well. These are, of course, only some of the hypersonic weapons currently known to be in development in Russia , China , and other countries around the world , including the United States , reflecting a growing arms race in this regard. This has, in turn, prompted the U.S. military, among others, to initial work on systems to defend against these threats. Hypersonic boost-glide vehicles present particular obstacles for defenders due to their combination of high speed and maneuverability while traveling along an atmospheric flight trajectory. This is a general flight pattern that is dramatically different from the ones that most missile defense systems, which have been focused for years primarily on detecting, tracking, and intercepting more conventional ballistic missiles, are optimized to protect against. A graphic offering a very rudimentary depiction of a notional hypersonic boost-glide vehicle flight profile as compared to that of a typical ballistic missile. The flight path of a low-flying air-breathing hypersonic cruise missile is also shown., GAO In response, the U.S. military has been looking to expand and improve its missile defense sensor networks . This includes plans for new space-based systems , as well as terrestrial ones. Just this week, the Pentagon announced that the construction of its first new Long-Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) array, at Clear Space Force Station in Alaska, had been completed. Another LRDR array is eventually set to be built in Hawaii . LRDR has “the ability to search, track and discriminate multiple, small objects in space, including all classes of ballistic missiles,” according to the Pentagon . “Future iterations of the radar’s software will allow it to also track hypersonic missiles.” There is separate work being done on the development of new interceptors to actually try to shoot down incoming hypersonic weapons. MDA, together with the U.S. Navy, has previously announced plans to test a missile defense-specific version of the highly capable SM-6 missile against a surrogate for an “advanced maneuvering threat,” a term that has been used to refer to hypersonic boost-glide vehicles. In November, MDA had announced that it had hired Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman to provide competing designs for an all-new Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI). The goal of the GPI program is to acquire an interceptor capable of knocking down a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle in the midcourse portion of its flight. Artwork Raytheon released in relation to its Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) proposal., Raytheon Any new sensors or interceptors will need to be tested against representative threats and the U.S. military’s need to expand testing capacity to support its growing work on hypersonic defense, as well as actual hypersonic weapons, has been increasingly clear . MDA has leveraged previous U.S. military hypersonic weapon tests as one way to help gather relevant data for hypersonic defense work. However, having its own surrogate targets to test against, which could be built to be more representative of potential threats, would be a valuable addition to MDA’s overall testing architecture. If the vehicle that Stratolaunch will now provide is designed to be reusable, it could introduce new economies to future testing regimens. Stratolaunch’s goal is for the Roc, which only flew for the second time ever in April, to be eventually able to carry up to three Talon-A-sized vehicles at once. “This unique capability enables multiple hypersonic flight opportunities on a single day or the near-simultaneous launch of three Talon vehicles, which may support specific operational scenarios,” according to the company’s website. This might point, potentially, to Roc’s future ability to support testing representing multiple incoming hypersonic threats at once depending on the size of the target design. In addition, a reusable vehicle combined with the Roc mothership would offer a very flexible system to support a high testing tempo at multiple locations. This could all be especially valuable given that the vast majority of U.S. hypersonic and missile defense-related flight and live-fire testing takes place at various locations across the Pacific . For Stratolaunch itself, the new deal with MDA points to a more secure future for the company and for the Roc. After Paul Allen died, there were concerns that the entire enterprise might fold . As it stands now, the world’s largest airplane looks set to become an important addition to the test assets supporting future U.S. military hypersonic defense developments.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 5, 2021",Saudi Arabia Is Running Out Of Patriot Missiles In Its Conflict With The Houthis,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia is requesting “hundreds more” missile rounds for its U.S.-supplied Patriot air-defense systems as it continues to wage a war against drones (as well as rudimentary cruise missiles) and ballistic missile attacks launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi forces based in neighboring Yemen. The diminishing Saudi missile stocks reflect the extent of the challenge facing The Kingdom, which recently sought to buy additional AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs , to arm its fighter jets against some of the same threats. Writing today in the Wall Street Journal , Gordon Lubold reported that the United States is “poised to formally approve” a Saudi request for additional Patriot missile rounds. This comes amid fears within The Kingdom that the scale of drone and missile attacks “could result in significant loss of life or damage to critical oil infrastructure.” Saudi Patriot launchers during Exercise Ramah al-Nasr 1 that took place in the country earlier this year., Saudi Press Agency Unnamed U.S. officials confirmed to the same publication that the U.S. State Department was now considering the sale, although the Saudis were also looking to Gulf and European allies to resupply its Patriot missile stocks. In these cases, however, U.S. approval would still be required to transfer hardware to the Saudis. “The United States is fully committed to supporting Saudi Arabia’s territorial defense, including against missiles and drones launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen,” a senior official from the Biden administration told the Wall Street Journal . “We are working closely with the Saudis and other partner countries to ensure there is no gap in coverage.” Unnamed U.S. and Saudi officials pointed out that the scale of the Houthi drone and missile onslaught is such that almost a dozen ballistic missile and drone strikes are now recorded on Saudi territory each week, a tempo that’s remained more or less constant for several months now and which is markedly greater than in 2020. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6b5esH459o8 According to one unnamed Saudi government official speaking to the WSJ , there were 29 drone strikes on Saudi Arabia last month and 25 times in October. At the same time, there were 11 ballistic-missile attacks last month and 10 in October. A series of videos showing ballistic missiles being intercepted over Riyadh in 2018: Cross-border attacks of all types launched by the Houthis into Saudi Arabia this year amount to around 375 so far, according to Timothy Lenderking, the U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen. With some of the best-equipped armed forces in the region, Saudi Arabia has been employing Patriot systems to intercept ballistic missiles and, in some cases, drones. Drones have also been downed repeatedly by air-to-air missiles launched from F-15s and other fighter jets. Each of those scenarios pits sophisticated defensive weapons costing up to $1 million apiece against targets which, at the lowest end, may cost only a few thousand dollars to produce. So, while the Saudi defenses may achieve a success rate of almost 90 percent against these targets, according to U.S. officials, the result is not only costly in financial terms but also takes a heavy toll on missile stocks. At the same time, the wider problem of defending Saudi airspace has been compounded by the departure of U.S. military assets from the country as part of a wider drawdown of American forces in the Middle East. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, then the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, meets with troops at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, in Jan. 2019, after America deployed fighter jets, Patriot missile batteries, troops, and other systems., AP/Lolita Baldor However, under President Joe Biden, the issue of supplying arms to Saudi Arabia has also become more complicated, with the administration concerned by The Kingdom’s conduct in the war in Yemen as well as human rights abuses conducted inside the country and externally . Last month the U.S. State Department approved the sale of the 280 AMRAAMs to Saudi Arabia, comprising a mixture of AIM-120C-7 and C-8 models, to be sold via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process, pending approval by the U.S. Congress. At the time, the U.S. State Department stated on Twitter: “We’ve seen an increase in cross-border attacks against Saudi Arabia over the past year. Saudi AIM-120C missiles, deployed from Saudi aircraft, have been instrumental in intercepting these attacks that also [place] U.S. forces at risk and over 70,000 U.S. citizens in The Kingdom at risk.” In response, eight senators have now come together up to propose a joint resolution that would block the proposed AMRAAM sale. The AIM-120s are not capable of attacking land targets and can only be considered defensive weaponry in regards to the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Regardless, resistance to providing AMRAAMs is likely to apply also to the requested Patriot missiles, as well. However, there is U.S. self-interest involved, too, chiefly in protecting critical oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia against the relentless Houthi attacks. Among the most notorious examples are the dramatic strikes on Saudi oil infrastructure in the northeastern portion of the country in September 2019, which the Houthis claimed responsibility for, although the U.S. government subsequently blamed Iran directly for that particularly complex operation. A Saudi military display of what it claimed were Iranian cruise missiles and drones used in attacks on its oil industry at the Aramco facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, during a press conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in September 2019., AP/Amr Nabil It could well be the case that Washington decides to supply Patriot missiles and/or AMRAAMs while also continuing to push for an end to the war in Yemen and to highlight human rights abuses by the Saudi regime. Without the delivery of more Patriot missiles and AMRAAMs, the Saudis could be left with a serious and worsening problem. After all, the alternative means of destroying or disabling these kinds of ballistic missile and drone attacks are few. A Saudi F-15 shoots down a low-flying Houthi drone, in a video that emerged earlier this year: For example, other types of ground-based air defense systems , as well as soft-kill systems , are normally only effective against drones at shorter ranges and lack the ability to provide coverage over a wide area. In the future, a directed-energy weapon might provide a more cost-effective option for destroying drones, but the vast majority of such weapons are still in development and are considered less proven than existing, but very expensive, hard-kill systems like missiles. Defeating ballistic missiles is a harder proposition still and can only really be achieved by an advanced missile-based air-defense system. Alternatives to the Patriot are available, and, in the past, Russia has offered its S-400 system to Saudi Arabia. Still, even an order placed for Russian systems wouldn’t address the huge cost gap between defender and aggressor and those systems are not nearly as proven as the Patriot from this challenge mission set. There is also the reality that the U.S. would not likely allow it due to security concerns and sanctions are already imposed on allies that buy such Russian-made systems, which could send a fissure through the deep military relationship between The Kingdom and the United States. There is also a larger strategic issue involving Iran. Armed with many advanced ballistic missiles that would be used in large numbers during the opening hours of a conflict in the region, countering an Iranian barrage is the central mission of Saudi Arabia’s Patriot system. Without fresh stocks of missiles in place, The Kingdom’s own forces would be far more vulnerable. These forces could be key in an allied operation against Iran should hostilities break out. There is also a significant portion of the global oil supply that would be put at greater risk without Saudi Arabia’s Patriot system being active and well-stocked. Clearly, the threats that Saudi Arabia now faces are multiple, and there is no single solution that will be able to deal with ballistic missiles and drones effectively and affordably. For the time being, replenishing stocks of Patriot missiles and AMRAAMs would seem to be the most relevant approach, providing that the U.S. government allows such a deal to be executed.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian military hardware, including medium-range surface-to-air missile systems, continues to pour into areas of the country adjacent to Ukraine, as concerns grow that Moscow could be preparing some kind of new invasion of Ukrainian territory. Videos that recently emerged on social media appear to show an extensive array of Buk-M1 air defense systems and related equipment, together with tanks and artillery, at a rail marshaling yard relatively close to the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, Chief of the Defense Staff in the United Kingdom, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, has warned that a full-scale invasion of Ukraine “would be on a scale not seen in Europe since World War Two.” The videos in question were posted to the Russian Telegram messaging site yesterday and have been assessed by the Conflict Intelligence Team, or CIT, an open-source information analysis group.

In the past, these identification features have been removed from Russian vehicles as standard practice for participation in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Earlier video, which appeared on social media on October 29, had also shown elements of a Buk system, reportedly underway by rail somewhere in the Smolensk Oblast, further to the north, but also in a region bordering Ukraine: This was reportedly filmed in #Smolensk region, western #Russia , with the Russian army weaponry being moved on a train: pic.twitter.com/cu5g5Bfxm4 — Alexander Kokcharov (@alex_kokcharov) October 30, 2021 Most notoriously, it was a Russian Buk system that a Dutch-led joint investigation team concluded had shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, after launching a missile from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine in July 2014. All 298 passengers and crew aboard the airliner were killed. CIT says it has received information indicating that the various military equipment now at Maslovka has arrived in the last few days by train. These have reportedly come from Naro-Fominsk in the Moscow Oblast, Ilyin in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, and Krasny Bor in the Smolensk Oblast, all of which lie further northwest from the border with Ukraine. Using this information, CIT has said that the military units involved are most likely the 4th Guards Tank Division, 288th Artillery Brigade, and 49th Air Defense Missile Brigade, all of which are part of the 1st Guards Tank Army. Notably, the analysts have previously identified other elements of the 1st Guards Tank Army, including the 4th Tank Division at Maslovka. A previous movement of T-80U tanks from the 4th Tank Division: These are by no means the first such movements of Russian military equipment close to the country’s borders with Ukraine, but it is significant that air defense systems are now also present in such strength. Previously, Western intelligence and open-source analysts have tracked Russia’s positioning of heavy armor , artillery, and even long-range missiles in these areas. For them to operate in a potential conflict, they would require a protective ‘umbrella’ provided by the highly mobile Buk-M1 system, as well as other air defense systems. Meanwhile, Russia already possesses a considerable airpower advantage over Ukraine, and each additional air defense system in the region further erodes Ukraine’s ability to conduct any kind of meaningful air operations in a future conflict.

Official Ukrainian reports suggest that there are now approximately 100,000 Russian troops in the areas adjacent to the borders with Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Washington Post published a story stating that U.S. intelligence assesses the figure to be smaller, at around 70,000 Russian troops, but that Moscow is planning a large-scale intervention into Ukraine involving at least 175,000 personnel on the ground. That could happen by early 2022, an unnamed official from President Joe Biden’s administration has said, according to The Washington Post . VIA WASHINGTON POST A Ukrainian military intelligence map showing Russian military dispositions as of November 15, with around 40 “battalion tactical groups,” or BTGs, each with between 700 and 900 personnel., UKRAINIAN MOD VIA MILITARY TIMES Fears of a potential new Russian invasion of Ukraine surfaced back in January and have been building for weeks now , although the two countries have been engaged in conflict since 2014 when Russia launched an operation to seize the Crimean peninsula before deploying capabilities to support separatists in eastern Ukraine fighting the government in Kyiv. With the crisis seemingly escalating in recent days, Western leaders and military officials have waded in with stark warnings to Russia about the high stakes involved in any potential military action against Ukraine. While Ukraine is not a NATO member, officials from the alliance have voiced their concerns about the situation, especially after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that an expansion of NATO’s presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Moscow, would signify a “ red line ” for the Kremlin. In the United Kingdom, Admiral Radakin, the head of the British Armed Forces, has described the continuing Russian military buildup as “deeply worrying” and that another invasion could trigger the biggest conflict in Europe since 1945. Admiral Tony Radakin, who was the United Kingdom’s most senior sailor as the First Sea Lord, until he became the new Chief of Defense Staff in November., Crown Copyright In response to the potential threat of an invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom has come up with what Defense Secretary Ben Wallace describes as a “range of measures,” including “defense capabilities” that would be coordinated with NATO. Few concrete details have been provided, but the U.K. Ministry of Defense has sent a reconnaissance team to Lithuania, with a view to the potential deployment of British troops to the Baltic country, which also shares a border with Russia’s heavily militarized Kaliningrad exclave.

The United States already has troops in Ukraine now and only recently deployed a new rotation to support the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U). “The idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia from invading Ukraine is not in the cards right now,” Biden said . Instead, Biden has stressed that Washington is preparing “strong economic and other measures,” although Pentagon officials have also said there are no plans to arrange for Ukraine to receive additional defense equipment at this point. The U.S. government is still sending materiel as part of previous agreements, recent arms deliveries to Kyiv having included Javelin anti-tank missiles, a pair of refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats , and small arms. Consideration had been given to supplying Mi-17 Hip transport helicopters that had been previously operated by Afghanistan . With a growing war of words that’s now seemingly paralleling the buildup of Russian military equipment close to Ukraine’s borders, the situation is a delicate one. The appearance of a Russian Buk-M1 air defense system in battalion strength is further evidence that buildup but, by the same token, U.S. and Ukrainian officials continue to stress in public that there’s no firm evidence right now that Russia is fully committed to an invasion. With more Russian troops still being required in the region for a full-scale offensive, there is still time for de-escalation too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 24, 2021",General Atomics’ Rough Field-Capable Mojave Drone Breaks Cover,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has offered the first official details about a new unmanned aircraft it has been developing internally called the Mojave. Derived from the MQ-1C Gray Eagle that the company developed for the U.S. Army, it is optimized for short takeoffs and landings from semi-improved surfaces with an emphasis on supporting various kinds of expeditionary and distributed operations . Its new wing gives it a look that is reminiscent in some ways of the OV-10 Bronco . The company says that its improved short-field performance would also make it suitable for carrier-based operations without any need for a catapult to launch it or arresting gear during recovery. David Alexander, President of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), together with C. Mark Brinkley, GA-ASI’s Senior Director of Marketing & Strategic Communications, provided details about Mojave to The War Zone during a call with reporters yesterday. The Mojave, only one of which currently exists, took its first flight this past Summer and has conducted a number of flight tests since then. Alexander said that the company first began laying the groundwork for this drone around two and half years ago and that active work on it has been going on over the past two years. “This idea started back when we were thinking about how to be runway independent,” he explained. The decision to go with a short takeoff and landing (STOL) design came after the company determined it would be too difficult to meet its performance targets using a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) configuration. “It’s just fighting the physics all the time,” Alexander said, something that has certainly been noted over the years in the development of advanced VTOL aircraft . “We think this is a very efficient way to get you persistence and get it somewhat runway independent.” Mojave’s fuselage shares a similar mold line with the Gray Eagle, which was itself derived in part from the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper . However, it ditches the MQ-1C’s tail in favor of one that is more like that of the MQ-9. There are other significant differences toward the rear of the fuselage to accommodate a Rolls-Royce M250 turboshaft engine. The M250, a popular design that is already used to power various manned fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, is rated at 450 horsepower. This gives Mojave significantly increased power over the MQ-1C and its 165-horsepower Thielert Centurion 1.7 diesel engine. Compared to the Gray Eagle, the drone’s entire tricycle landing gear has been redesigned for rough field performance, including the addition of wider flotation tires designed to help it traverse sandy and otherwise loose terrain. A good look at Mojave’s beefy landing gear., GA-ASI The design of the Mojave’s wing is new, being optimized for maximum lift with the help of leading-edge slats and double-slotted flaps. It has a wider chord and generally broader dimensions, which Alexander likened to that of a crop duster , compared to the wings on the Gray Eagle or the improved Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER). The new drone’s wingspan is 52 feet, compared to the 56-foot span on the standard MQ-1C and the 58-foot one on the GE-ER. A view of the Mojave showing off its wing design., GA-ASI A Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER) drone., GA-ASI During testing so far, Mojave has demonstrated the ability to take off and land in less than 500 feet. The goal is that the drone, in its lightest configuration, would be able to get airborne and touch down in as little as 300 to 400 feet, a capability that would be enabled, in part, by an extremely low stall speed. Flight testing so far has shown that this unmanned aircraft can safely land at speeds as low as 45 knots. It “doesn’t even look like it should be flying, it’s going so slow,” GA-ASI’s President Alexander said. Of course, things like the total distance necessary to take off and land, as well as the drone’s range and endurance, would vary depending on its configuration. To get the total takeoff and landing roll down to 300 to 400 feet would likely require a more limited payload package focused on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and with a fuel load offering less than five hours of endurance. Mojave could be capable of staying airborne for up to 25 hours or more, but this would require more fuel, and therefore a greater takeoff weight, resulting in at least the need for a longer stretch of runway to get airborne. GA-ASI provided the chart seen below, which shows the projected relationship between the length of the takeoff ground roll and total endurance. With all this in mind, Alexander highlighted the internal modularity of the design and the flexibility this offers. GA-ASI In addition to the sensor turret under its nose, Mojave can accommodate various sensors, such as radars with synthetic aperture imaging functionality and signals intelligence suites, and as other payloads, such as communications packages, internally. It is designed to carry a significant array of weapons and other stores externally. “You can shorten the endurance down and carry a big load when you need to and then when you don’t, you can offload it and have much longer persistence,” Alexander said. The Gray Eagle and GE-ER designs can currently be fitted with four underwing pylons and one the centerline. Mojave has six underwing hardpoints, which are also rated to carry heavier loads, and a centerline one. The company has put particular emphasis on the new drone’s ability to carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles under its wings, but has stressed that it could carry various other weapons and stores depending on a customer’s requirements. An artist’s conception of a Mojave drone armed with 16 Hellfire missiles., GA-ASI GA-ASI General Atomics has already developed a number of different podded systems for use on MQ-1C, as well as the company’s larger MQ-9 Reaper, that could potentially make their way onto Mojave. This includes a self-protection pod with radar warning receivers, missile approach warning sensors, and the ability to release decoy flares or chaff in response to threats that are detected. That particular pod is part of an overall push on the part of GA-ASI to ensure that its entire product line will continue to be relevant, even in higher-end conflicts, as you can read more about here . An older General Atomics infographic showing various podded payloads developed for the MQ-9 and its derivatives. The self-protection pod, among others, could be compatible with the Mojave., GA-ASI Beyond the basic performance benefits that Mojave offers when compared to Gray Eagle or other similarly-sized unmanned aircraft, its design makes it eminently deployable, even to remote and austere locations with limited existing infrastructure. “A dirt road” is all you might need to serve as a runway, according to GA-ASI President Alexander. The drone’s very name is a reference to “one of the harshest and most austere areas the world, where deadly rattlesnakes and horned lizards adapt to survive the extreme forces of nature,” according to a company press release. This all seems even more fitting since General Atomics’ two flight test facilities, El Mirage and Grey Butte, are situated along dirt roads in the Mojave. “Ground Support Equipment can be self-ferried or transported by single UH-60 helicopter,” according to a fact sheet that GA-ASI, which says the drone can fly up to 2,500 nautical miles in a ferry configuration. The unmanned aircraft is transportable via C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft, needing only “1.5 hours from rollout-to-takeoff with a four-person team.” The full Mojave product card., GA-ASI Takeoff and landing, and just moving Mojave around on the ground, are all highly automated processes. “What we call auto-taxi is really the operator taxiing the aircraft,” Alexander explained. “So, we have a closed-loop control, so he can’t over-speed, he can’t over-turn.” “It allows the flexibility of the operator to taxi to get to the launch and recovery bucket and once you’re in the bucket, you just push a button for launch, and off you go,” he continued. “We don’t believe fully automating the taxi piece is prudent because usually taxi conditions are really dynamic and can change. So we think it’s better to have the operator in the loop.” GA-ASI Landing is as simple as pressing a button, too. “We’ve got algorithms now that use the EO/IR payload [the electro-optical/infrared sensor suite] and they target each end of the points where you want to run and that loads into the autopilot and you swing around and come down and do an auto-land,” Alexander said. This is a capability the U.S. Air Force demonstrated earlier this year on the MQ-9. “Without a doubt, all this has to be automated,” Alexander added, underlining the importance of those capabilities for operations from remote and austere locations. “The autonomy piece is just a must-have going forward. So, this will be clearly automatic takeoff and landing.” “We’re just not going to put another airplane out in the future without it,” he continued, referring to automatic takeoff and landing capabilities. When it comes to actually controlling the drone, GA-ASI is leveraging its Scalable Command and Control (SC2) system, which it has been developing for the U.S. Army. This is a software-based ground control system that requires only limited hardware, such as a Toughbook-style ruggedized laptop tied into a line-of-sight datalink on the ground. Mojave will also have a beyond-line-of-sight control capability via satellite link. The Scalable Command and Control (SC2) system., GA-ASI Mojave might feature more autonomous capabilities in the future “on the mission side, as well,” Alexander said. He specifically highlighted GA-ASI’s participation in the Air Force’s Skyborg program as an example of the work the company is already doing in this field. Skyborg is focused on the development of an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” and an associated suite of systems that would be used to operate semi-autonomous loyal wingman-type unmanned aircraft, as well as potentially fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). Beyond all this, Mojave’s “STOL capability increases the number of employment options available … potentially including aircraft carrier-based options, unlocking naval missions or sea-based support for special operations forces,” GA-ASI’s press release says. Company simulations indicate that the drone, coupled with an automated landing system like Raytheon’s Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS), “could go off a flat deck carrier today,” according to Alexander. If the carrier was going at speed of at least 20 knots the unmanned aircraft, in an appropriate configuration, should be able to take off without the need of a catapult and, after a sortie, would be recovered without having to use any sort of arresting gear. The endurance versus takeoff roll chart seen earlier in this piece suggests that Mojave could have an endurance of between 10 and 12 hours when launched off a carrier-sized landing area with no weapons. This could be hugely valuable to carrier strike groups and expeditionary strike groups, providing everything from persistent armed overwatch for force protection missions in ‘brown water’ environments to airborne communications relay and surveillance functions in ‘blue water’ environments. The Marines could also use Mojave in an amphibious assault ship-based close air support and strike role. There is also the possibility of anti-submarine warfare applications , as well. As for who might be looking to buy examples of these drones already, GA-ASI has seen “a tremendous amount of interest in the concept and in the aircraft itself,” according to Senior Director of Marketing & Strategic Communications Brinkley. However, he and Alexander declined to say specifically who they have been talking to already about Mojave. They did say, broadly, that there have been discussions with representatives from multiple U.S. service branches and a number of potential foreign customers. Mojave’s thick wing is seen clearly in this flight test image. , GA-ASI “The original idea on this, again, was special ops, downrange, very expeditionary,” Alexander said, indicating that the design was being targeted, at least in part, at special operations units. He specifically referenced the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) Armed Overwatch program , but acknowledged that initiative is not currently considering unmanned platforms. “We were hoping there’d be an unmanned part to the Armed Overwatch [program], we haven’t given up on that,” he said. “I think it’s a mistake not to include an unmanned aspect to that program.” The U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, which is already a major user of MQ-1Cs, including the GE-ER subvariant, might be another potential special operations customer. It’s not hard to see how special operations forces, in the United States and elsewhere, would be interested in a readily deployable unmanned platform with a high degree of persistence, as well as payload capacity, especially to support small footprint missions, such as counter-terrorism operations, in relatively semi-permissive environments. An MQ-1C assigned to Company E, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment on display in 2013., US Army Mojave’s performance, together with its payload and flexible deployment capabilities, could make it an attractive and potentially lower-cost option to take the place of more conventional manned and unmanned aircraft typically used to support those kinds of missions. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, looks set to be blocked again from retiring the venerable A-10 Warthog ground-attack aircraft, but continues to advocate for doing so. Mojave would be capable of performing some of the same missions sets while operating from similar forward locations and could present a new path to replacing the A-10 , at least in part. In addition, the Air Force, among other branches of the U.S. military, as well companies like General Atomics, are exploring ways to employ their existing slower, non-stealthy drones, such as the MQ-1C and the MQ-9, in support of higher-end conflicts. These proposed concepts of operation typically envision drones in this general category conducting various kinds of stand-off missions on edge of more contested airspace, including air-launching smaller drones into those higher-risk zones. An artist’s conception of a Gray Eagle Extended Range carrying various payloads including smaller air-launched drones and a self-protection pod., GA-ASI These same kinds of unmanned aircraft could provide useful persistent surveillance and force protection capabilities in rear areas, as well. Mojave offers potential additional benefits to support those missions via its increased suitability for expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations as a result of its small logistical footprint and short takeoff and landing capabilities. The Air Force demonstrated its increasing ability to automatically land MQ-9 Reapers at more austere airstrips without the need for a pre-survey earlier this year, a capability that could be valuable in various contexts going forward. That service, among others, is increasingly concerned about how vulnerable known bases with established runways might be during future high-end conflicts, which has prompted renewed interest in ideas for how to distribute forces and project power from austere locations with limited infrastructure. The U.S. Marine Corps, which officially began operating its own Reapers this year, is refining its own new core operating concept, known as Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO). At its most basic, EABO revolves around the idea of being able to rapidly deploy and reposition relatively small, but still highly capable Marine task forces to establish bases in forward areas, including on remote islands. These flexible responsive forces would then be able to help exert control over surrounding littoral areas and “seaspaces” to deter opponents and, failing that, be in an ideal position to engage them. Among its many parts, EABO envisions new unmanned aircraft , including the Marine Corps’ burgeoning MQ-9 fleet, as being key components of these future task forces. Mojave would seem to be much better suited to this concept of operations than the Reaper. Brinkley, GA-ASI’s Senior Director of Marketing & Strategic Communications, seemed to allude to this, at least to a degree, when he mentioned that company has seen “people’s eyes start to light up with sort of understanding, especially as you start to think about INDOPACOM, start to think about the possibility of landing on a hard-packed beach somewhere, or some of the really truly expeditionary possibilities.” INDOPACOM refers to the Indo-Pacific region and is the acronym for the U.S. military’s top command overseeing operations in that part of the world. A US Marine Corps MQ-9 Reaper., USMC Other American allies and partners around the world, but especially in the Pacific and in Europe, are presented with many of the same challenges and have similar requirements in support of new or otherwise evolving concepts of operations. Smaller countries elsewhere around the world with more limited infrastructure, to begin with, could have their own interests in a very capable unmanned platform to support counter-terrorism and other lower-intensity missions. Mojave’s Predator/Reaper/Gray Eagle pedigree would only make it more attractive compared to competing designs . Though the U.S. government has sought to make it easier to export unmanned aircraft technology under the Trump administration , GA-ASI’s Brinkley still stressed that it remained easiest to pitch the company’s products to countries that are part of NATO or are otherwise key U.S. allies. The company has established relationships with a number of NATO members through the sale of MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reapers, as well as improved derivatives of the latter design. “When you consider a lot of the posture of NATO, certainly a lot of their naval posture would be a good fit for this aircraft,” Brinkley said. “You see a lot of ramped carriers and things that operate across NATO allies, which … could be useful to them perhaps.” Mojave on the runway during a recent flight test., GA-ASI NATO members in Europe, especially those along the alliance’s eastern flank , face the very real prospect of not having assured access to their established runways on land during a major conflict, particularly one with Russia. Mojave with its impressive STOL capabilities and a large payload could be very useful in that context, where roads might become more readily available runways . All told, Mojave, though derived from an existing General Atomics design, represents a very interesting new direction for the company. “We think there’s a mission out there for this aircraft,” Brinkley said. It will certainly be interesting to see how Mojave evolves as testing continues and who might publicly emerge as potential customers for the hardy drone going forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 9, 2021",Navy’s Newest Destroyer Was Just Commissioned Flying A Giant “Go For Broke” Flag,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Daniel Inouye (DDG-118) was commissioned today, December 8th, 2021, in its new homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The ship is named after the late Daniel Inouye, a Medal of Honor recipient, World War II veteran, and long-serving Senator from Hawaii. Inouye’s incredible lifetime of public service, passing away in 2012 while still representing Hawaii in the Senate after nearly 50 years, made him one of the most well-known native-born sons of that state. But his valor in combat was near super-human and DDG-118’s giant blue flag reflects that. Here is how the Medal of Honor citation reads for the ship’s namesake: Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action on 21 April 1945, in the vicinity of San Terenzo, Italy. While attacking a defended ridge guarding an important road junction, Second Lieutenant Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail of automatic weapon and small arms fire, in a swift enveloping movement that resulted in the capture of an artillery and mortar post and brought his men to within 40 yards of the hostile force. Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the enemy halted the advance with crossfire from three machine guns. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun nest. Although wounded by a sniper’s bullet, he continued to engage other hostile positions at close range until an exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were again deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 enemy soldiers were killed and eight others captured. By his gallant, aggressive tactics and by his indomitable leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to advance through formidable resistance, and was instrumental in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye’s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army. Daniel Inouye as a First Lieutenant and received the Medal of Honor from President Bill Clinton. , US Army/US Gov Inouye’s service during World War II is even more notable as he served with the highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team , a unit made up entirely of soldiers of Japanese descent. And that is where the motto “Go For Broke” on the giant blue flag DDG-118 was seen flying at its commissioning came from, it’s the same as the 442nd Regimental Combat Team’s motto. The torch is also from the 442nd’s insignia . DDG-118’s flag. , USN USN According to the Daniel K. Inouye Institute’s website , the unique aspects of the ship’s flag include: A strong circular seal designed to be the focal point. The 442nd’s torch and “GO FOR BROKE“ motto from preliminary concepts were kept as central elements in the seal. Other design elements in the seal were similar to those in the ship’s crest to create continuity in meaning and a cohesive look. A background that incorporates authentic ‘ohe kapala (bamboo stamping pattern) that was designed by a Native Hawaiian artist. USN Ships’ flags serve as a source of pride and morale for the crew, but also as a way to honor the namesake of the ship itself, as we have seen time and again . Still, DDG-118’s triumphant commissioning in Daniel Inouye’s home state, and the vessel’s historic homeport, is really a special thing. Add in that it happened the day after the 80th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack , an event that changed the course of human history and especially the course of Inouye’s life, adds all that much more significance to an already significant moment. DDG-118 gets a Hawaiian blessing prior to it entering service. , USN We wish the crew of DDG-118 only the best as they execute mastery of their domain on the high seas in their brand new destroyer with a very special name.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",Enlisted Pilots Operating Global Hawk Drones Could Soon Be A Thing Of The Past,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is poised to make a dramatic about-turn on its decision to have enlisted pilots ‘fly’ (it’s a semi-autonomous system) RQ-4 Global Hawk reconnaissance drones. Four years into a much-heralded experiment to have noncommissioned ranks operate the high-flying unmanned aircraft systems, the service is now looking to return those enlisted pilots to other roles. Rachel S. Cohen of Air Force Times reported yesterday that Chief of Staff Gen. Charles ‘CQ’ Brown, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force JoAnne Bass jointly wrote a letter last week calling for the change. That decision, if taken, will affect the careers of around 75 enlisted airmen currently operating the RQ-4. That number of some way short of the original target of 100 enlisted drone pilots by 2020. A crew chief from the 380th Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron pulls a set of chocks while escorting an RQ-4 Global Hawk back to a hangar during ground operations at an undisclosed location in Southwest Asia in 2015., U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Christopher Boitz Once again, it needs to be emphasized that the plan is not yet set in stone, but the fact the Air Force boss and its highest noncommissioned officer are pushing for the change is highly significant and it’s a message clearly aimed at enlisted pilots to provide some indication of what might come next. “Enlisted [drone] pilots deserve to hear directly from their leaders on the current status of the program so they can make informed decisions regarding future service options,” Master Sgt. Jarad Denton, a spokesman for Bass, told Air Force Times . Under the Brown-Bass proposal, at least some of the enlisted airmen from the RQ-4 community would have the chance to continue operating the drones, but only after going through the officer training pipeline and receiving their wings. For those who want to continue enlisted careers, new posting options will include flight engineer, aircraft loadmaster, refueling specialist, and others. Another option would be to return to the job they did before becoming drone pilots. The latest move is a major turnaround compared to the Air Force’s previous official position. As recently as August, Bass was talking about expanding the community of enlisted drone pilots. Master Sgt. Alex, a 12th Reconnaissance Squadron RQ-4 Global Hawk student pilot, stands in front of an RQ-4, June 21, 2017, at Beale Air Force Base, California. Alex was one of the service’s first airmen to graduate from the Enlisted Pilot Initial Class. Alex was previously stationed at Beale as a sensor operator before graduating from the EPIC program to become an RQ-4 pilot., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Tristan D. Viglianco “Enlisted pilots have proven themselves to be masterful in piloting [drones],” Bass said at the time. “I think if given the opportunity, they can continue to do that and more. We are shaping out what that looks like.” Originally, the enlisted pilots had been introduced to the RQ-4 enterprise in 2017 as a way of helping meet the growing demand for the intelligence-gathering asset from combat commanders, not only in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, but also in the Asia Pacific region, in Europe, and elsewhere. For the Air Force, it was the first time since World War II that its aircraft were flown by pilots that were not commissioned officers. With the outbreak of that conflict, to meet an urgent demand for qualified pilots, enlisted airmen were allowed to earn their wings. That opportunity was only brief, coming to an end with the Flight Officer Act in 1942. A milestone RQ-4 mission flown out of Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates in September 2019 demonstrated the practicality of the experiment, as an all-enlisted crew operated the aircraft downrange. “Enlisted or officer, the responsibilities of the pilot are the exact same — safe and legal operation of the RQ-4 in international and national airspace,” said Master Sgt. Michael in an Air Force news release at the time. “We are all trained and expected to demonstrate proficiency at all times. There’s no difference between ‘us and them.’ We are pilots, plain and simple.” Enlisted RQ-4 Global Hawk crew members pose for a photo in October 12019, at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, a month after an all-enlisted crew launched and recovered an RQ-4 to perform operations from the base for the first time., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Chris Thornbury Since then, however, the Global Hawk’s fortunes have changed, with another attempt by the Air Force to do away with at least a significant portion of the drones. The service’s current plans call for the removal of 24 Global Hawks from the current inventory of 31 during the 2022 fiscal year. The drones in question are the older Block 20 and 30 models, which would leave just the RQ-4 Block 40s to conduct the high-altitude surveillance mission. Rather than retiring the Block 20 and 30 drones, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends they should instead be adapted for other non-frontline missions, including as surveillance platforms to monitor hypersonic missile tests. You can read here about how the first of the drones are being reworked as Range Hawks.

Whatever the Air Force has waiting in the wings to conduct these missions, in conjunction with satellites as well as other ‘distributed’ sensors, the fact is the Global Hawk is edging toward the exit. Under current plans, the Air Force will be left with just seven of the more capable RQ-4 Block 40s by the end of 2022. Master Sgt.

Viglianco Since having enlisted pilots operating the RQ-4 was always billed as an experiment, despite its apparent success, it was always a likely candidate for the ax, if the situation regarding the platform it is based around changed. Clearly, a smaller RQ-4 fleet reduces the requirement for airmen to operate them, making the enlisted pilot experiment essentially redundant. With the service now apparently set on scrapping this crew concept alongside a downsizing of the Global Hawk fleet, it’s unclear whether we will see enlisted airmen fly Air Force drones again in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 1, 2021",Secret Space Force Capabilities Could Be Declassified If New Bill Becomes Law,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest draft of the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act, for the 2022 Fiscal Year includes a provision that would require the Pentagon to conduct a declassification review of every classified program that the U.S. Space Force is presently managing. Much of the U.S. military’s space-related activities are highly classified , which has often made it difficult for officials to publicly discuss what they are doing now and advocate for increased funding and other support for new and improved capabilities. The disclosure of certain capabilities , even in part, could also help deter attacks on American assets in orbit, which a senior Space Force officer recently revealed are happening “every single day.” The House and Senate Armed Services Committees announced they had finished work on the latest version of the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) yesterday. The proposed bill includes various compromises that those Committees are hopeful will finally lead to its passage in the Senate, after which it would head to President Joe Biden’s desk where he would decide to either sign it into law or veto it. Section 1609 of this new draft NDAA calls for the Secretary of Defense to, “not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, conduct a review of each classified program managed under the authority of the Space Force” to see if the classification level of any of those programs could be lower or if they could be declassified entirely. Then, “not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary completes such review, commence the change to the classification level or the declassification as determined in such review.” US Congress US Congress The Secretary of Defense, currently Lloyd Austin, would be instructed to conduct those reviews together with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy and any other elements of the Department of Defense he deems appropriate. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees would also receive reports on the Pentagon’s proposed actions, its timeline for actually carrying out any changes to the levels of the classification of any Space Force programs, and a discussion of the potential security risks resulting from those decisions. It is, of course, important to note that there is no requirement here to actually declassify anything. However, U.S. military officials and members of Congress have been increasingly pushing for reducing the level of classification surrounding American space-based and related capabilities in recent years for a number of reasons. One immediate benefit from reducing the levels of classification surrounding U.S. military activities in or related to space would simply be the ability of the Space Force to just be more open about what it does. While there is certainly a need for operational security to help the U.S. military maintain its competitive edge in space, classified programs typically cover higher-end, often expensive capabilities where extreme secrecy can just as often limit their impact as help it depending on the exact circumstances. Beyond that, less classification would allow the Space Force to better promote its mission and otherwise advocate for itself publicly, which could help with recruitment and securing funding for priority projects. Even before Space Force was formally established last year, U.S. Air Force officials had lamented how the many layers of secrecy made it difficult to just talk publicly about space-related activities and the ever-growing national security issues facing the United States outside the Earth’s atmosphere. “The lack of an understanding really does hurt us in doing things that we need to do in space,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett said back in December 2019 . “There isn’t a constituency for space even though almost everyone uses space before their first cup of coffee in the morning.” Then-Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, at center in red, walks with Air Force personnel in the Pentagon in December 2020., USAF The U.S. military today is heavily reliant on space-based platforms for early warning , intelligence-gathering , navigation and weapon guidance , communications and data-sharing, and more. “As members of the Armed Services Committee and the defense appropriators, we get it. But we have to have our other colleagues in the Congress to be supportive of us making the changes we need and the resources we need into this,” Representative Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and one of the Space Force’s most outspoken advocates , had said while speaking alongside Barrett two years ago. “It’s not going to happen until they understand the threat and the dependence we have. And I don’t think that can happen until we see significant declassification of what we’re doing in space and what China and Russia are doing, and how space is in their day-to-day lives.” How the high degree of classification surrounding space-based and related capabilities impact public discussions of the potential threats assets in orbit is an important issue at play here. Russia and China in particular have fielded various anti-satellite capabilities and are in the process of developing more . These include, but are not limited to terrestrial anti-satellite interceptors , directed energy weapons that can at least disrupt the functioning of certain kinds of satellites, and on-orbit systems . The latter category consists of so-called “ killer satellites ,” which are small types capable of maneuvering close to their targets in space and then attacking them in various ways, such as firing projectiles or even just simply trying to smash into them. A graphic depicting the various ways one satellite might attack another in orbit, including by simply acting as a kinetic kill vehicle and smashing into the target., DIA These threats are not only real – Russia just destroyed a defunct spy satellite with a ground-based interceptor in a test in November – at least some of them are being regularly employed against American assets in space already. U.S. Space Force Gen. David Thompson, who is Vice Chief of Space Operations, the service’s second in command, revealed that U.S. government satellites are facing “reversible attacks” from Russia and China on a daily basis in an interview with The Washington Post ‘s Josh Rogin in November. Reversible attacks are not intended to permanently damage a satellite and include things using lasers to blind optics or electronic warfare jamming. US Space Force Gen. David Thompson, Vice Chief of Space Operations., DOD The inability of the Air Force in the past, and now the Space Force, to talk openly about its ability to detect and respond to those threats has long presented a challenge when it comes to deterring those kinds of malign activities. “It’s not enough to stand in the ring and take punches,” then-U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in 2019 at the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium. “You have to have the will and capability to punch back. “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had said at that same symposium. “They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.” As The War Zone has explored in-depth in the past, public information about the U.S. military’s so-called “counter-space” capabilities and its capacity to wage what has been more recently termed “orbital warfare” remains extremely limited. The Space Force officially acknowledges having only one counter-space capability in service now, a ground-based electronic warfare system called the Counter Communications System (CCS), but there are others in the classified realm. Trailer-mounted antenna dishes associated with the Counter Communications Systems Block 10.2., L3 HARRIS TECHNOLOGIES “The only two things you told me about the U.S. ability to fight in space, are the ability to maneuver your satellites and to jam other satellites. Is that it?” CBS News’ David Martin asked Air Force Gen. John Hyten, then head of Air Force Space Command, in 2015 in an interview for “60 Minutes.” “That’s not it, but that’s all I can tell you,” Hyten, who just recently retired from his last posting as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had responded. The issues of over-classification are not limited to the programs that Space Force manages, though they present particularly good examples, Officials have made clear in the past that this is a U.S. military-wide problem. “In many cases in the department [of Defense], we’re just so overclassified it’s ridiculous, just unbelievably ridiculous,” Gen. Hyten said last year . “We have got to push down the classification to where it makes sense.” If this new version of the 2022 Fiscal Year NDAA is ultimately signed into law, we may begin to learn a host of all-new details about the U.S. military’s space-based capabilities in the new year.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 17, 2021",Kuwait Has Received Its First Typhoon Fighter Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The modernization of Kuwait’s fighter fleet took its next step forward with the official handover of the first two Eurofighter Typhoon jets to the emirate at the manufacturing facility in Italy. The Kuwait Air Force, or KAF, is the initial customer for the latest multirole Tranche 3 (P3Eb) standard of the Typhoon, equipped with the new Captor-E active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and other upgrades, features that other customers also plan to adopt in the future. The handover took place yesterday at the Leonardo Group’s Caselle facility near Turin. The ceremony was attended by officials that included the KAF’s deputy commander Air Vice-Marshal Bandar Al-Mezyen, and Kuwait’s ambassador to Italy, Sheikh Azzam Mubarak Sabah Al-Sabah. The KAF’s second-in-command told the Kuwait News Agency the two jets will be delivered to Kuwait next week. An official photograph of the handover ceremony for the first Kuwaiti Typhoon jets at Caselle on Dec. 7., KNA “This is a milestone in our comprehensive strategy to bring about a quantum leap in the preparedness of the Kuwait Air Force and the fruit of a long history of the defense cooperation with Italy,” Al-Mezyen said. The first two Typhoons for the KAF were both twin-seat aircraft, which completed their maiden flights from Caselle on October 15. Based on a photo of the handover ceremony, they have since been joined by a single-seater, although it’s not clear if this jet has yet flown. The accompanying photos were captured by Alessandro Maggia, whose Instagram page is well worth a look. He shot the first two KAF Typhoons during their flight-test program at Caselle. The Kuwaiti government signed an acquisition valued at around $8.7 billion with Finmeccanica, now called Leonardo, in April 2016. This covered 28 Typhoons, comprising 22 single-seaters and six two-seaters. Also included were operational training, three years of operational support and logistics packages, plus dedicated infrastructure at Ali Al Salem Air Base, where the KAF Typhoons will be based. Since then, however, the program has been subject to serious delays. The first aircraft entered the final assembly phase in October 2018, and it had been planned to deliver an initial jet to the KAF in 2019. Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia Now, however, the KAF is poised to receive the most advanced Typhoons in service anywhere to date. As well as the Captor-E AESA radar, also known as the ECRS Mk 0, which you can read about in-depth here , the P3Eb package includes other advanced features. Kuwait’s Typhoons will also be the first to be fitted with the Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-33 Sniper advanced targeting pod (ATP). In terms of weapons, the jets will be supplied with the MBDA Brimstone air-to-ground missile and Storm Shadow standoff cruise missile . They will have provision for the Meteor long-range air-to-air missile but will initially be provided with the AIM-120C-7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia As part of the deal, pilots for the KAF Typhoons are undergoing operational training with the Italian Air Force, at Grosseto Air Base, home of the Italian operational conversion unit (OCU). The overseas training effort is of vital importance for the KAF. The service doesn’t operate its own training fleet, with both its Short Tucano turboprop trainers and Hawk Mk 64 jet trainers currently being grounded . While there have been abortive plans in the past to return at least the Hawks to airworthiness, both Tucanos and Hawks are previous-generation types that lack the advanced cockpits required to prepare pilots for the Typhoon or Super Hornet. Instead, KAF pilots complete basic and advanced training phases with the Italian Air Force at Lecce-Galatina Air Base, flying the Aermacchi MB-339 , before undergoing lead-in fighter training (LIFT) on the same service’s Leonardo M-346 at the same base. Overall, the Kuwaiti Typhoon order cements the jet’s reputation in the region, with four Middle Eastern nations having bought it; Oman, Qatar , and Saudi Arabia are the others. Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia Alessandro Maggia While the Typhoon will be a significant advance over the 30-year-old F/A-18C/Ds now in service, it’s just one part of a two-phase fighter revamp, for an eventual total of 56 new aircraft that will replace the 29 surviving ‘legacy’ Hornets. One of the original Kuwaiti F/A-18C jets, seen in the United States prior to delivery., U.S. Navy Under a government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deal worth around $10 billion and agreed to in June 2018, Kuwait is also receiving 28 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. These jets, the first of which broke cover in its service colors in September last year, are completed to a hybrid Block II/ Block III standard. They include advanced features such as an upgraded AN/APG-79 AESA radar, Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures, and an advanced targeting pod. The cockpit is equipped with Elbit Systems wide-area cockpit displays, while the airframe life is extended from 6,000 to 9,000 hours, among other improvements. A KAF F/A-18E Super Hornet during touch-and-goes at the Boeing facility at Lambert International Airport in September 2020., BRYAN BAISLEY The Super Hornets have all now been delivered to the U.S. Navy , pending handover to the KAF in the coming months, with the delivery schedule having been interrupted by the effects of the COVID pandemic. Fielding two separate fighter fleets, from different sources, is a new prospect for Kuwait, but it follows what’s becoming common practice among the Gulf states. As well as Saudi Arabia, with its long history of procuring American and British fighters, Qatar is now buying fighters from three different sources , while the United Arab Emirates may well add F-35 stealth jets to its recent Dassault Rafale order . This policy not only ensures political and military ties with the supplier nations but should help ensure long-term fighter availability if one source is cut off. While the KAF is fairly small, it has traditionally maintained high levels of capability and invested in good training. In addition, the KAF has gathered recent combat experience in support of the Saudi-led coalition’s military intervention in Yemen , conducting airstrikes against Houthi rebels. With both the Typhoon and Super Hornet close to delivery, the KAF will have one of the most modern and capable fighter fleets in the Middle East.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 22, 2021",Flying Boats Flew Japan’s Little-Known Follow-On Raid On Pearl Harbor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Eighty years ago today, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States headlong into World War II, and the event’s notoriety has ensured it has remained a profound touchstone in the public’s imagination ever since. The surprise raid of December 7, 1941, exacted a heavy toll on the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet battleships in particular, but it was not enough for Imperial Japan. That country staged a much less well-known follow-up attack less than three months later, this time using huge four-engine Kawanishi H8K flying boats, at the time a brand-new weapon, in what was one of the longest bombing missions flown up to that time. The effects of the December 7 raid were, at first sight, immense, with the Imperial Japanese Navy, or IJN, having scored hits on all eight of the Pacific Fleet battleships, destroying two of them and putting the remainder out of action for different lengths of time. On top of the materiel losses, more than 2,400 Americans had been killed. Although the United States had been dragged into the war, Japan now continued its imperial conquest of Asia, with hopes that a weakened U.S. Pacific Fleet would be unable to stop it. Very quickly, however, it became clear that the actual damage to the naval base at Pearl Harbor was limited. While 21 ships had been damaged to some degree, the vast majority could be repaired . And this process was made easier by the fact that the shipyards and maintenance facilities at the base had survived almost unscathed. Fuel reserves at the base had also been spared, and the Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers had not been in port when the IJN struck. The wrecked destroyers USS Downes (DD-375) and USS Cassin (DD-372) at Pearl Harbor in the wake of the December 7, 1941 attack. USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) is astern, occupying the rest of the drydock., NATIONAL ARCHIVES In March 1942, the IJN was ready to launch a follow-up surprise raid on Pearl Harbor, known as Operation K. The original December 7 mission had been planned as Operation Z. The aim of this attack was to put a stop to the recovery and maintenance work ongoing at the base, further blunting the Pacific Fleet’s ability to counter the IJN across the Asia Pacific theater. The mission was also intended to gather reconnaissance on the overall situation at Pearl Harbor. While Operation Z had been spearheaded by multiple aircraft carriers , as well as submarines large and small , Operation K would send a much smaller package of bomb-carrying flying boats. The chosen aircraft was the Kawanishi H8K, which was given the Allied reporting name Emily. Described by aviation historian René Francillon as “the most outstanding water-based combat aircraft of the Second World War,” the H8K was then one of the most recent types to enter IJN service — it had made its first flight in prototype form in January 1941, with production authorized later that year. It was judged the ideal platform for the second raid on Pearl Harbor thanks to its prodigious range — more than 4,400 miles in patrol configuration — and its useful internal bombload of up to 4,400 pounds. Other potential long-range bombing missions using the H8K against targets in California had apparently been discussed but were quickly shelved. The mighty H8K in a preserved state. , Max Smith/Wikimedia Commons Long range would be a prerequisite of the second raid on Pearl Harbor, which would involve a 4,800-mile round trip. Never before had a small number of aircraft attempted such a long bombing mission, and few, if any, had covered such a distance without any fighter escort. If successful, more similar raids were planned, with the aim of further degrading the U.S. Navy’s warfighting potential. In fact, despite its size, the H8K would later demonstrate an unusual ability to survive encounters with enemy fighters. It was surprisingly maneuverable in the air, and it was protected by a very heavy defensive armament, with up to five 20-mm cannons and four 0.303-inch machine guns mounted in various positions around the aircraft. Although initial plans called for five H8Ks to take part in Operation K, only two were ultimately available for the mission, both assigned to the Yokohama Naval Air Corps. The big flying boats took off from their base at Wotje Atoll in the Marshall Islands, in the western Pacific Ocean, on March 4, 1942. Lt. Hisao Hashizume commanded the first aircraft, with Ensign Shosuke Sasao in charge of the second one. Each flying boat was armed with four 550-pound bombs, which were to be dropped on the docks at Pearl Harbor. Remarkably, this was the first time the aircraft had even been deployed in combat. An H8K in flight in July 1944. Seconds later it was shot down by a U.S. Navy Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator of Bombing Squadron 115 (VB-115) from which the photo was taken., U.S. Navy The flying boats first touched down at French Frigate Shoals, around 1,900 miles from Wotje Atoll, 560 miles northwest of Honolulu. This was the largest atoll available in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, owned by the United States, but remote and unoccupied and used by the IJN as an anchorage. Here the flying boats rendezvoused with two submarines that were waiting to refuel them . Seen during initial sea trials, I-15 was one of the two designated refueling submarines at French Frigate Shoals., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS When darkness fell, the H8Ks took off and headed toward Oahu. In fact, as they had been ahead of the December 7 attack, U.S. codebreakers were aware that the Japanese were planning on some kind of operation involving refueling at French Frigate Shoals. As was the case in the lead-up to the Pearl Harbor raid, this intelligence was apparently ignored. The 4,800-mile round trip took the two H8Ks from the Marshall Islands to Hawaii and back., WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The Japanese, too, suffered from the vagaries of the intelligence available to them. They had been able to intercept and read U.S. weather reports that would have helped find a window with clear weather over Pearl Harbor. A change in the American codes cut them off from that information and meant the H8Ks were now going to be flying through clouds and rain. Regardless of the U.S. intel misstep, at a distance of around 200 miles from Hawaii, the flying boats were picked up by two U.S. radar stations in Hawaii, and P-40 fighters were scrambled from the island to intercept them. Though they had no airborne radar of their own to warn them of this response, the Japanese intruders were cloaked by darkness and thick clouds and managed to slip through the defenses, arriving over Oahu at around 15,000 feet early in the morning of March 4. Although the night and poor weather offered the IJN aircraft protection, the downside was that their crews now had to find their targets visually. With little in the way of moonlight to help them, and with a blackout over Hawaii since the December attack, it was left mainly to dead reckoning. Plans to have the IJN submarine I-23 off Pearl Harbor to help guide the flying boats to their target also fell through when it disappeared off Hawaii. I-23 was subsequently determined to have been lost, but the circumstances of its sinking are unknown to this day. Archival footage of the H8K: The crews of the IJN flying boats dropped their bombs, but under these conditions, they were relying on a good degree of luck to get anywhere near their naval targets. Instead, the weapons from Hashizume’s aircraft fell on the foothills of the extinct volcano outside Honolulu, blowing out the windows of a high school but not causing any injuries. It’s unclear what happened to Sasao’s bomb load, but it likely came down into the water, after he had lost contact with the bomber leader as they began their attack run. After dropping their weapons, the two flying boats flew southwest toward the Marshall Islands. Sasao managed to return to Wotje Atoll, but Hashizume’s aircraft had damaged its hull on departing French Frigate Shoals, so he instead flew to his home base at Jaluit Atoll, also in the Marshall Islands. The raid had been a success in terms of launching a very long-range bombing mission against Hawaii and arriving there unscathed. As such, the Japanese used it for propaganda value, reporting considerable damage to Pearl Harbor as well as multiple U.S. casualties. The actual military result had been negligible. In fact, the mission had the very opposite effect as what had been hoped. A second mission was flown on March 10 but ended in disaster. Hashizume’s H8K was shot down by Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo fighters from U.S. Marine Corps fighter squadron VMF-211 near Midway Atoll. An F2A-3 Buffalo from VMF-211 is loaded aboard the USS Curtiss at Pearl Harbor for shipment to Midway Islands, in March 1942., U.S. Navy Instead of putting a stop to the U.S. Navy’s recovery plans for its Pacific Fleet, the initial raid had alerted the Americans to the continued threat posed against Hawaii. While the IJN raiders had not been intercepted, the radar coverage insured at least that it could be determined that they had refueled at French Frigate Shoals. In response, a U.S. Navy destroyer was now tasked to patrol the area to watch for Japanese activity. An aerial view of the newly constructed East Island Coast Guard LORAN station at French Frigate Shoals in April 1945., U. S. Navy A little over a month later, the U.S. military launched a long-range bombing mission of its own, flying 16 B-25 bombers off the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to attack a string of Japanese cities on the Japanese mainland. The main value of the April 18, 1942 “ Doolittle Raid ” also lay in what it signaled to the enemy — namely, that the United States was willing and able to take the war to the heart of Japan. With the United States now demonstrably on the offensive, Japan was compelled to double down on its effort against Hawaii, convinced that it had to conquer these islands and destroy the U.S. Navy’s carrier fleet to blunt any future American aggression. The next step toward Hawaii was the Midway Islands, where the U.S. Navy and IJN would come to blows in a major battle of June 1942, in what was widely considered the turning point in the Pacific War. In an ironic twist to the story of the H8K in the Pacific campaign, as Wyatt Olson observed in his account for Stars and Stripes , the flying boats were to be tasked with reconnaissance of the U.S. Navy’s carriers ahead of the Battle of Midway . But ever since the two H8Ks had used French Frigate Shoals to attack Hawaii, the islets had been closely guarded by the U.S. Navy. With the shoals unavailable to launch scouting missions, the IJN was deprived of vital intelligence that would likely have warned them that American carriers were lying in wait for them at Midway. As it was, the U.S. Navy sent four Japanese flattops, among other enemy ships, to the bottom of the Pacific during that battle. An H8K on its beaching gear at a land base., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive While the second attack on Pearl Harbor ended up in many ways setting the stage for the ultimate defeat of the IJN at sea and for the unraveling of Japan’s imperial ambitions in Asia, the H8K would soldier on until the end of the war. Still, although it was never built in numbers that approached the American PBY Catalina or the British Short Sunderland , the H8K established a reputation for excellence. However, the 167 examples built were increasingly wasted on missions such as troop transport, as the tide of the war turned against the Japanese. Today, military flying boats have a much more limited presence in the Asia Pacific region. It’s notable that ShinMaywa Industries, which today builds US-2 amphibious aircraft for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, or JMSDF, is descended from the Kawanishi Aircraft Company that built the H8K. There has been revived interest in this kind of capability within the U.S. military more recently. In a turn of events that would have been unimaginable 80 years ago, a senior officer from the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command last month visited the JMSDF unit at Iwakuni, Japan, to learn more about its US-2s, as the command continues to look toward fielding an amphibious version of the MC-130 transport.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense says that the wreckage of a Royal Air Force F-35B Joint Strike Fighter that crashed into the Mediterranean Sea shortly after taking off from the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth last month has been recovered. Successfully locating the remains of the aircraft and retrieving them had been a top priority given the operational security risks that would have been posed if any part of the plane had fallen into the hands of a less than friendly country, such as Russia. “Operations to recover the UK F-35 in the Mediterranean Sea have successfully concluded” and “there is no danger or compromise to sensitive equipment on the aircraft,” a statement from the Ministry of Defense said, which was posted by The Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom. That outlet said that it had taken two weeks to locate the wreck on the seafloor and then another week to successfully bring it up to the surface. A Royal Air Force F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Crown Copyright The U.S. and Italian Navies had also been involved in the search and recovery effort, “which was hampered by rough seas,” The Sun reported, adding that “the wreckage was recovered to a chartered salvage ship.” The Royal Air Force (RAF) F-35B from No. 617 Squadron, the “Dambusters,” had plunged into the Mediterranean on Nov. 17, 2021, for still unknown reasons. The pilot ejected and was recovered safely. An earlier report suggested that the aircraft had ingested an air intake blocker and that the pilot had unsuccessfully attempted to abort the takeoff after it became clear that the aircraft would not reach sufficient speed to get airborne, but this remains unconfirmed. A video, seen in the Tweet below, had emerged on social media last week that appeared to show the crash as recorded by a video camera system on HMS Queen Elizabeth and was in line with that report.

Regardless of the cause of the accident, the aircraft, or at least the bulk of what is left of it, are now safely back in the hands of the U.K. government. As The War Zone previously reported , the remains of an F-35 of any type could have been an intelligence windfall for a potential adversary, especially if the aircraft could be recovered largely intact. Similar concerns had been raised after a Japanese F-35A crashed in the Pacific Ocean in 2019. At least some of the wreckage of that jet was left at the bottom of the sea. Russia, with its fleet of deep-diving special- mission submarines , as well as the deep-sea salvage ship Yantar , and with its very active presence in the Mediterranean, was the country most likely to have both the means and opportunity to try to get to the aircraft first. Those concerns were shared by British officials. “We are aware of Russian undersea capabilities, and you are quite right to identify them as being state of the art,” National Security Adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove had said before the U.K. House of Commons’ Defense Committee yesterday. “The kinds of precautions and operations that we are undertaking at the moment are designed at least in part to ensure that the technology of the F-35B remains as confidential as you would like it to be. Those security aspects are very much at the top of our mind. My understanding is that the experts know where the aircraft is.” “The recovery of the flight data recorder and the wreckage are really vital for an accurate investigation to determine the causes of the crash,” Lovegrove had also said. Now that the wreckage of the aircraft has been recovered, U.K. investigators may be able to fully determine the circumstances of the crash, though it remains to be seen when that information might become public. The remains of the aircraft are now at least secure and do not now pose any security risk.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2021",U.S. Military Steps Up Planning For Evacuation Operation In Ukraine As Crisis Deepens: Report (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has been conducting more immediate planning for potential evacuations of U.S. diplomatic personnel and other American nationals from Ukraine in the event of a new, large-scale Russian military intervention into that country, according to a report from CNN . At the same time, U.S. officials are warning that there may be limited options to deter the Kremlin from conducting such an operation. This news came ahead of a virtual summit between U.S. President Joe Biden’s with Russian President Vladimir Putin today over this brewing crisis, with intelligence assessments already warning for weeks that Russia could launch a new invasion of its neighbor as soon as January. Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, included details about U.S. military contingency planning in briefings to members of Congress on Dec. 6, 2021, according to CNN . The State Department would need to formally request support from the Department of Defense to carry out a so-called non-combatant evacuation operation, or NEO, before any such mission could be carried out. US President Joe Biden waves to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the beginning of their virtual summit on Dec. 7, 2021., Mikhail Metzel, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP “Right now, the Pentagon is planning for a number of different scenarios in the event that an evacuation is necessary, ranging from a smaller evacuation of just nonessential U.S. government employees to a larger one involving a broader swath of American citizens,” CNN reported. “The State Department would be responsible for ultimately determining whether an evacuation operation is necessary. Right now some planning is underway by the State Department’s diplomatic security for either an authorized or ordered departure of diplomats from the country should the situation warrant it.” The CNN story did not include any details about exactly what a Ukraine NEO might look like if the U.S. military were to be called in to conduct it. Planning for such an operation could include the forward deployment of various American special operations and conventional forces to the territory of NATO allies bordering Ukraine to the west. The U.S. military already has a significant forward presence in Poland , for instance, that includes access to established airbases in that country that could be used to stage aircraft, personnel, and equipment. Last month, online flight tracking software picked up an unusual flurry of U.S. Air Force transport aircraft flying to the country of Djibouti in East Africa in what looked to be pre-positioning of forces for a possible NEO in neighboring Ethiopia. A member of the U.S. Air Force, at left, and a Polish special operator, at right, watch a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft take off during contingency operations training in September 2021., USAF “The U.S. does not want to be caught ‘flat-footed’ in the event of an unexpected invasion, said one source familiar with the matter,” according to CNN, reflecting the continuing criticism that the Biden administration has faced over the chaotic evacuation of Americans and others from Afghanistan after the country fell to the Taliban in August. “Still, officials emphasized that any potential evacuation in Ukraine likely would not resemble the massive U.S. effort to evacuate all American citizens from Afghanistan earlier this year.” As already noted, the U.S. military has significant access to Ukraine’s western neighbors, something it did not have in the case of the Afghanistan evacuations. This would have immediate and significant impacts on the comparative size and scope of any future Ukrainian NEO. Publicly, the State Department continues to stress that there is no need for any such evacuations from Ukraine now. Publicly, U.S. officials, as well as their Ukrainian counterparts, say that there are no indications that the Kremlin has actually decided to launch a new, large-scale military operation into Ukraine, either. “We don’t know that Putin has made up his mind to use force,” Bill Burns, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), said at the Wall Street Journal ‘s CEO Council Summit yesterday , echoing sentiments that have previously emanated from the State Department and the Department of Defense. “What we do know is that he’s putting the Russian military, the Russian security forces in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way.” There have been U.S. travel advisories in place for Ukraine due to the potential for open conflict since 2014, when Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula and then began actively supporting ostensibly local “ separatists ” fighting the government in Kyiv. There is also a separate “Do Not Travel” advisory at present over a surge in COVID-19 cases in Ukraine. Of course, the U.S. military has standing plans for conducting various types of NEOs in Ukraine already, and it is only prudent to ensure they are up to date given the state of the current crisis. U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence assessments show that the Kremlin has deployed tens of thousands of troops near Russia’s borders with Ukraine and could have up to 175,000 personnel , at least, in place by early next year. This, coupled with the establishment of supply lines and the deployment of medical units, essential for sustaining major combat operations, make it clear that the threat of a new Russian invasion is real, whether or not it ultimately comes to pass. CNN’s suggests that the more active planning for potential evacuations is based on growing fears that a new Russian intervention in Ukraine may be increasingly inevitable, despite public statements downplaying those concerns. As part of her briefings to lawmakers, “Nuland … acknowledged that the US’ options to deter an invasion are fairly limited, a person familiar with the briefing said,” according to that outlet. Nuland had been primarily briefing legislators about Biden’s meeting today with Putin. Reports yesterday said that Biden was likely to threaten Putin with significant new sanctions, including against Russia’s banking sector , as well as the deployment of additional forces in NATO countries bordering Ukraine, among other actions, in the event of a new Russian invasion. The U.S. government would also appeal to its allies and partners to do the same, including asking Germany to at least review, if not cancel a major gas pipeline deal with Russia called Nord Stream 2. In addition, Biden was expected to tell Putin that the United States would step up support for Ukraine’s military, including increased deliveries of weapons and other equipment, if the crisis continues. Ukraine itself has been working to bolster its capabilities in the face of the increased threats from Russia, including ordering additional Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drones . So far, there does not appear to be any serious discussion about U.S. or other foreign troop deployments to Ukraine proper. However, Foreign Policy reported yesterday that officials in Ukraine had asked for U.S. National Guard personnel already in the country as part of an established American security assistance program to be allowed to travel closer to potential flashpoints. The obvious idea here would be that that they could present a deterrent for Kremlin, which have different views about the potential risks from killing American service members compared to Ukrainian troops. U.S. Army personnel in Ukraine assigned to the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U)., JMTG-U How the crisis will now evolve following Biden and Putin’s meeting today remains to be seen, but the U.S. government is clearly prudently preparing for a worst-case scenario. Updated 8:50 PM EST: The U.S. and Russian governments have now both issued formal readouts of today’s Biden-Putin meeting. “President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European Allies about Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine and made clear that the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation,” according to the White House. “President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy.” The White House’s readout also said that Biden and Putin talked about unrelated issues, including ransomware attacks linked to Russia and negotiations with Iran over that country’s controversial nuclear program. “The President of Russia, using specific examples, illustrated the destructive line of Kiev, aimed at the complete dismantling of the Minks agreements and agreements reached in the ‘Normandy format’, expressed serious concern about Kiev’s provocative actions against Donbass,” according to the Kremlin’s readout, referring to various multi-national agreements in place that are supposed to provide a framework for negotiations to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region. “Putin stressed that the responsibility [to de-escalate] should not be shifted onto the shoulders of Russia, since it is NATO that is making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory and building up its military potential at our borders.” Russian officials for weeks now have asserted that their troop movements in the region are simply in response to provocations from Ukraine, as well as NATO. Just last week, Putin laid out new “red lines” regarding the crisis that focused heavily on NATO expansion near its borders, especially the potential future deployment of longer-range ground-based missiles, such as the hypersonic and other types that the U.S. Army is currently developing. The U.S. government and NATO, of which Ukraine is not a member and is not currently on any sort of formal path to join, have pushed back against the assertions and red lines. The Kremlin has a history of these kinds of deflections when faced with criticism over malign or otherwise concerning behavior on the international stage. At the same time, Russia has made clear over the years that it sees NATO expansion as a threat to its national interests and that it views Ukraine as being firmly within its sphere of influence . U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has now held a press conference regarding the meeting, as well. He outlined many of the proposed courses of action that the U.S. government could take in the event of a new Russian intervention into Ukraine that have already been reported, including pressure to halt the Nord Stream 2 project. “Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,” Sullivan said when asked about what would be different now compared to the U.S. government’s response to the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “If Putin wants to see gas flow through that [Nord Stream 2] pipeline he may not want to invade Ukraine.” Sullivan also said that Biden had not offered any sort of concessions or other commitments to Putin regarding Ukraine potentially joining NATO in the future. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has released its own statement regarding potential evacuation planning, stating that “Contrary to news reports, U.S. gov’t is not currently considering evacuations of government personnel or American citizens from Ukraine. We conduct normal contingency planning, as we always do, in the event the security situation severely deteriorates.” CNN’s report, however, had not been the U.S. government was considering whether or not to actually conduct such an evacuation operation, but that planning had been stepped up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 27, 2020",Iran’s Newest Warship Has Fallen On Its Side In A Dry Dock (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A satellite image confirms that an Iranian naval vessel known as the Talayieh has rolled over in a dry dock in the port of Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. Video had earlier emerged on social media showing this ship lying on its port side in a partially flooded dry dock. Prior to this incident, the Talayieh , seemingly a derivative of the Moudge class corvette design about which there is little publicly available information, was reportedly either in the final stages of construction or fitting out and had been expected to enter service next year. Late yesterday, Chris Biggers, Mission Applications Director at HawkEye 360 , a company specializing in radio-frequency data analytics using a commercial satellite constellation, tweeted an image from Planetscope of Bandar Abbas, which is home to the Iranian Navy’s main base of operations, taken on Dec. 4, 2021. Though the resolution is low, it does show a ship in a dry dock that appears to have fallen over. The position of the ship and its general location aligns with what can be seen in the video reportedly showing Talayieh that appeared online on Dec. 4. From the imagery available, it is difficult to tell what the full extent of the damage to the Talayieh might be. There is yet to be any official word on the incident from Iranian officials. Simply sitting on its side in the water for an extended period of time could lead to a number of issues that, in turn, might require significant time and energy to rectify, especially if there is any internal flooding. As noted, the Iranian Navy had reportedly hoped to put this ship into service sometime next year. Otherwise, details about Talayieh , including just its basic design and intended mission, are extremely limited. Although the hull form is similar to the Moudge class corvette’s, its superstructure appears larger and boxier. Previous Iranian media reports , citing Iranian officials, have indicated that Talayieh could have improved intelligence-gathering and perhaps electronic warfare capabilities, compared to the Moudge class. An earlier picture of Talayieh under construction., ISNA Those reports, coupled with the substantial changes in the ship’s design, have led to suggestions that it could be intended as a dedicated spy ship rather than just an improved subvariant of the Moudge . That being said, the Sahand , the third Moudge class type to enter service, featured a revised, boxier superstructure. So, it is equally possible that Talayieh simply reflects a further evolution of the design. The Moudge class corvette Sahand ., AP The Moudge class corvette Jamaran ., Mohammad Sadegh Heydari via Wikimedia The Moudge class design itself is an enlarged derivative of the Alvand class , a type built in the United Kingdom that the current regime in Iran inherited from the government of the Shah after the revolution in 1979. The existing 1,500-ton-displacement Moudge class corvettes are armed with both anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, as well as torpedoes, a 76-mm main gun, and various smaller cannons and machine guns. What is clear is that Talayieh is part of a broader effort on the part of the Iranian Navy to modernize and otherwise expand its capabilities, with a particular eye toward conducting maritime operations well beyond the country’s immediate periphery. Earlier this year, Sahand , together with the Makran , a sea-base-like ship , became the first Iranian naval vessels to sail into the Atlantic Ocean . They subsequently sailed to the Russian port of St. Petersburg to take part in a naval parade in that country. Any substantial delay in Talayieh entering service, or worse, depending on how damaged the ship might be now, could be a major setback for the Iranian Navy. It is also the latest in a string of significant losses for the service in recent years due to accidents of various kinds. In 2018, Damavand , another Moudge class corvette, sank in the Caspian Sea after running aground during a storm. The following year, the Iranian Navy claimed the ship had been “ fully revived ,” but there were questions at the time, based on satellite imagery, about whether an entirely new ship was actually under construction to replace it. In May 2020, the Konarak , an Iranian Navy support ship, was destroyed in a friendly fire incident during an exercise, killing at least 19 sailors. An unpowered Iranian barge mocked up to look like a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier also sank while being towed back to Bandar Abbas after an exercise last year, creating a navigational hazard . Then, this year, the Kharg , a replenishment ship that was arguably one of the most important vessels in service in Iran, sank in the Gulf of Oman after suffering a major fire . The significance of Kharg to the Iranian Navy had prompted speculation that the ship might have been sabotaged, potentially by Israel. Iran has suffered a string of curious fires, including some at port facilities , as well as explosions at various important sites in the country, such as ones linked to the country’s controversial nuclear program , in recent years. Reports at the time indicated that Israel, or agents working on its behalf, carried out at least some of those attacks, possibly in coordination with the United States. Since at least 2019, Israel and Iran have been conducting a shadow war against each other’s commercial and military vessels , as well. There were new reports just this weekend about an explosion near Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, which authorities claimed was related to a drill that involved the shootdown of an unmanned aircraft. Separately, one of Iran’s knock-offs of the U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone crashed in the country under curious circumstances, as you can read more about here . However, there are no indications that what happened to Talayieh is related to any of this or is anything more than an accident. It remains to be seen what, if anything, the regime in Iran will say about the incident. Update 12/7/2021: There are now unconfirmed reports that a person may have died in this dockyard accident involving Talayieh .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 8, 2022",Two New Secret Drone Programs Could Emerge In The Air Force’s Next Budget Proposal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall says he wants to get two new classified unmanned aircraft programs into the defense budget for the 2023 fiscal year. Kendall did not offer specific details about either of these projects but said they both would involve designs intended to work together with manned fighter jets and bombers . Kendall talked briefly about these unmanned aircraft programs and his desire to get them into the fiscal year 2023 budget in an interview with Politico on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. This event, which a number of senior U.S. military officials spoke at or otherwise attended, took place at the Reagan Library in California this past weekend. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall., USAF “I’ve got two that I’m going to have in the ’23 budget in some form,” Kendall told Politico . “They’re both unmanned air combat vehicles, unmanned platforms that are designed to work in conjunction with fighter aircraft like [the one under development under Next Generation Air Dominance program] or F-22 or the F-35 . On the other hand, they work in conjunction with bombers like the B-21 .” “These will be acknowledged classified programs, but I am going to try to get them started in ‘23,” the Air Force Secretary continued. The 2023 fiscal year will begin on Oct. 1, 2022. Typically, the Pentagon releases a public version of its budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year in the spring as part of a larger proposed spending plan from the incumbent presidential administration. While Kendall did not elaborate on what these programs might entail, his basic description of what the drones in question would be expected to do sounds very much in line with the concept of a “loyal wingman.” This refers to unmanned aircraft that are designed to operate networked together with manned platforms. It seems very likely that Skyborg, or an outgrowth of it, is one of the programs that Kendall was referring to. Skyborg is focused on developing an artificial intelligence-driven “computer brain” and a suite of associated systems that will be able to fly semi-autonomous loyal wingman-type drones and could also take control of future fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). The Air Force is now flight testing Skyborg components and has hired Boeing, General Atomics, and Kratos to build drones to carry the full array of systems. The service has said in the past that it hopes to have a loyal wingman-type unmanned aircraft using this technology in service by 2023. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), which is managing Skyborg together with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), has also been exploring the Defender concept put forward by General Atomics. That company’s Defender proposal envisions an unmanned aircraft derived from its somewhat stealthy Avenger design that would act as a loyal wingman focused on the defense of increasingly vulnerable, but still critical, support aircraft, such as aerial refueling tankers. The Air Force has already begun conducting tests of how tankers , in particular, would work together with loyal wingman-type drones. A model depicting a Defender drone at the Air Force Research Laboratory’s booth at the Air Force Association’s 2021 Air Space & Cyber Conference., Joseph Trevithick The Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program will include manned and unmanned components as well, which are designed to work together. The service has previously disclosed that at least one NGAD demonstrator of some kind has been flying already. There has been separate talk in the past about using future B-21 bombers networked together with unmanned aircraft in an air-to-air combat role . The most recent official rendering of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber., U.S. Air Force Beyond all this, the Air Force is publicly working on a number of other advanced unmanned aircraft projects , such as MQ-Next that is looking for a stealthier successor to the MQ-9 Reaper , and other tangential efforts, including the development of advanced communication gateway nodes , that could, at least in part, inform future loyal wingman designs. In recent years, the Air Force has utilized Kratos’ stealthy XQ-58A Valkyrie design , in particular, to support various advanced unmanned testing. These are also just the programs and initiatives we know about and it is well established that there is other relevant work being done in the classified realm . In addition, there’s the possibility that the two planned programs Kendall mentioned could include a higher-end, fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that could function as a loyal wingman, but also operate more independently of manned platforms. For instance, as already noted, the Air Force has discussed using systems developed as part of Skyborg to support future UCAV development. Regardless, it would not be at all surprising for the Air Force to want to transition any number of these projects, secret or otherwise, into one or more formal programs of record with the hope of fielding actual operational capabilities in the near term. This is all in line with Kendall, along with other senior officials from the service, becoming increasingly outspoken about the need to acquire new types of advanced manned and unmanned aircraft to maintain America’s military edge against potential adversaries, particularly China , and to a lesser extent Russia . “If it doesn’t threaten China, why are we doing it?” Kendall said during a panel discussion at the Reagan National Defense Forum. At the same time, Kendall’s remark that he intends “to try to get” these two new programs into the fiscal year 2023 budget indicates that he is not entirely convinced that this will happen. That, in turn, brings up long-standing questions about why the Air Force continues to lag behind in actually fielding advanced stealthy semi-autonomous and fully autonomous unmanned aircraft, despite decades of known work developing the necessary technology to do so. The War Zone has highlighted this troubling reality in great detail , including the history of UCAV development and how it all suddenly disappeared when it was proving to be what some would claim the most disruptive air combat technology since the jet engine. What Kendall is talking about now could reflect the possibility that more substantive work in this regard has been going on in the classified realm, which is more or less a given, but doing small-scale secret testing does not provide the critical mass needed to actually impact the trajectory of a major conflict. Kendall’s desire to “get them started” in the 2023 fiscal year budget would seem to suggest that he is not simply outlining a plan to publicly acknowledge some collection of existing secret efforts that are actively working toward producing operational capabilities. The two Boeing X-45A experimental unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) demonstrators that the Air Force, together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, tested extensively in the 2000s. These drones are among a number of publicly acknowledged advanced unmanned platforms with high degrees of autonomy that the US military has tested to great success, but that curiously didn’t lead to actual operational capabilities of any meaningful scale., PHOTO BY DAVID MCNEW/GETTY IMAGES Of course, he did say that “the existence of the programs will be disclosed formally in the budget request, which will go to Congress early next year, but the details will be secret,” according to Politico . All told, it remains to be seen if Kendall will be successful in getting these new publicly acknowledged advanced unmanned aircraft programs into his service’s next budget proposal and, if he does, what details about them and their relationship to existing or past projects might be disclosed at that point. No matter what, if the programs Kendall mentioned to Politico , or similar initiatives, don’t make it into the 2023 Fiscal Year budget request, it will be hard not to see how America’s near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, are the ones actually moving ahead openly on multiple fronts in this space.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 29, 2018",The British Army’s Got Its Hands On Its New Sky Sabre Air Defense Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Army is now protecting objectives against aerial threats with the new-generation Sky Sabre air defense system , leveraging surface-to-air missile technology already in use on Royal Navy warships. The system, combining surveillance radar, tactical datalink, and missiles, provides a much-needed replacement for the Cold War-era Rapier low-level air-defense system. The U.K. Ministry of Defence announced today that the Sky Sabre has now begun to enter service with the British Army’s 16 Regiment Royal Artillery and subsequent deliveries will “be configured to operate in all parts of the globe.” The different components of the Sky Sabre system are mounted on 8×8 MAN trucks., Crown Copyright The regiment, which is part of the 7th Air Defence Group , based at Baker Barracks on Thorney Island, West Sussex, has now embarked on an “extensive training package” to complete the transition from the Rapier, which will gradually be phased out of service. “Sky Sabre’s spearheading technology has significantly upgraded the protection of our forces from threats from the air,” said U.K. Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin. “This cutting-edge … defense system is a clear demonstration of our warfighting capabilities to those who wish to do us harm.” “We will be able to compete with our peers and take on some of the toughest adversaries,” added Lt. Col. Chris Lane, Commanding Officer of 16 Regiment Royal Artillery. Sky Sabre ”gives us a capability we have not had before; this new missile system with its new launcher and world-class radar will absolutely put us at the forefront of ground-based air defense.” The major components of the Sky Sabre include a Saab Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam (AMB) 3D medium-range surveillance radar mounted on an extending mast and with a range of up to 75 miles. Prior to being integrated within Sky Sabre, the same radar was already in use with the British Army for roles including air surveillance and counter rocket, artillery, and mortar. Once detected, threats are processed using the Surface-to-Air Missile Operations Center (SAMOC) that handles command and control and also shares information with other land, sea, and air assets via the NATO-compatible Link 16 tactical datalink. The SAMOC’s fire-control computer can guide 24 missiles to individual targets simultaneously. This part of the system is supplied by Israel’s Rafael company. CAMM test firing demonstrating the soft vertical launch technology., MBDA The cutting edge of Sky Sabre is MBDA’s Common Anti-Air Modular Missile, or CAMM, also known as the Land Ceptor. The same CAMM missile is also used in naval applications — including aboard U.K. Royal Navy warships — as the Sea Ceptor. Fitted with an active-radar seeker, the CAMM is derived from the infrared-guided Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air-Missile (ASRAAM) that’s in service on Royal Air Force Typhoon jet fighters, among others . The ASRAAM’s rocket motor, warhead, and proximity fuse are all ported into the CAMM. Launch cells for the Sea Ceptor missiles aboard the Type 23 frigate HMS Lancaster , transitting along the coast of Norway in March 2021., Crown Copyright Weighing over 200 pounds, each CAMM is twice as heavy as a Rapier missile and has three times the range: MBDA claims a range of more than 15 miles for the CAMM, while the British Army attributes its latest Rapier FSC version with a range of just over 5 miles. A Rapier FSC system from the British Army’s 16th Regiment Royal Artillery, deployed to Estonia., Crown Copyright As well as improved performance, the CAMM is able to tackle a wider range of threats more applicable to the modern battlefield, including low-observable targets, high-speed missiles, drones, and precision-guided air-to-ground weapons. Like the Rapier FSC, each launcher carries eight missiles. Survivability is enhanced by having the missile launcher, radar, and command-and-control elements located over nine miles apart. The Sky Sabre launcher can also be reloaded in less than half the time that was needed to replenish missiles on the Rapier, using soft vertical launch canister rounds. A solider from the 16th Regiment, The Royal Regiment of Artillery, deploying the Agile Multi-Beam surveillance radar, with the Land Ceptor missile launch vehicle in the background., Crown Copyright Although regularly updated, the original Rapier entered service with the British Army in the early 1970s and went on to see operational service in the Falklands campaign , during Operation Desert Storm, and, more recently in defense of London airspace during the 2012 Olympic Games. That latter assignment also reflects the likelihood that the Sky Sabre will also be deployed to protect domestic critical infrastructure when necessary. As defense analysis website Navy Lookout explains: “Sky Sabre will typically be employed to protect Army formations or forward airbases and the 24 sets being purchased are a fraction of what would be required to establish a protective umbrella over the many vulnerable military and civilian sites in the U.K. To provide comprehensive in-depth defense, particularly at high-value sites or where radar range is constrained by the environment, Sky Sabre might need to be backed with additional short-range systems such as radar-directed cannons or Starstreak HVM batteries.” Introducing the Sky Sabre is clearly a huge advance over the older system, essentially extending air defense cover beyond the short-range domain to help bridge the gap with longer-range systems. Soldiers in the SAMOC command-and-control vehicle of the new Sky Sabre air defense missile system. , Crown Copyright In fact, in its latest defense review , published earlier this year, the U.K. Ministry of Defence describes Sky Sabre as a medium-range capability, intended to supplement a new short-range system , based on the Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile, or LMM , which has a range of less than five miles: “Investment in ground-based air defense will deliver a system of survivable and digitally connected platforms with a new short-range capability, including small drones, and a new deployable medium-range capability. These will give the Army an air defense capability to defeat modern airborne threats.” In particular, the same document outlines the threats posed by China’s development of a “full spectrum of air capabilities including fourth and fifth-generation fighters , multiple Intelligence Surveillance Targeting Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) aircraft, the Y-20 heavy transport aircraft, [and] armed stealth Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).” Attention was also brought to the ability of even smaller state or non-state actors to threaten existing air defenses through “the imaginative employment of relatively low-cost capabilities,” with Libya offered as an example. Here, Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have proven vulnerable to attack by armed drones and other weapons. Video showing the destruction of Pantsir-S1 systems in Libya by various Turkish drone strikes: https://youtube.com/watch?v=-2eErnb3Jpk Beyond these scenarios, there is also a growing requirement for high-end air defense in the European context , an issue that’s only becoming more pressing as Russia continues to build up its defenses on its western borders as well as challenging NATO’s resolve in the Baltic region , the Black Sea , and elsewhere . MBDA is meanwhile working on an extended-range version of the missile, the CAMM-ER, primarily to meet an Italian requirement. This missile is expected to have its range increased to around 30 miles, thanks to a new motor, making it much more of a medium-range system, although there is so far no sign that the British Army is currently looking at acquiring it. A computer-generated image of the CAMM-ER showing its enlarged motor section at the rear., MBDA Whatever happens with CAMM-ER, the British Army still lacks a ground-based long-range air-defense capability, in the class of the Patriot PAC-3 . While the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers , with their Sea Viper missiles, have the range, there are only limited scenarios in which the warship’s defensive umbrella could actually be integrated with the land-based Sky Sabre. Realistically, however, the British Army would be working closely with allies, primarily the United States, in most potential large-scale conflicts that would require extended air defense coverage. No doubt with this in mind, the CAMM became the first foreign missile to be integrated within the U.S. Army’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IAMD IBCS). This is the service’s new missile defense network , and the integration work was completed back in 2019 by MBDA and Northrop Grumman. On the other hand, there are already not enough Patriot batteries available, so it might not always be possible for the United States or another ally to simply plug the gap when required. While the U.K. Ministry of Defence says the Sky Sabre is “expected to see service worldwide, much like [its] predecessor Rapier,” there remains the fact that the new system is less mobile, with three separate and bulky, truck-mounted components. In comparison, the Rapier FSC was a towed unit with integrated radar that could be towed by a light all-terrain vehicle or transported as a slung load by a single helicopter. The three different trucks that constitute Sky Sabre. From left to right: radar, SAMOC, and missile launcher., Crown Copyright Meanwhile, outside the British Army, Poland is the next customer for the ground-based CAMM, with an agreement signed last month between the defense ministries of the two countries. Under this Statement of Intent, the United Kingdom will collaborate with Poland on NAREW, Poland’s future ground-based air defense system, which will use the CAMM missile. NAREW will provide a lower-tier complement to Poland’s forthcoming Patriot air defense systems, due to be delivered from next year in PAC-3+ configuration together with the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IAMD IBCS) architecture that will allow Patriot and CAMM to be integrated within the country’s missile defense network. The Polish version of CAMM chosen for the NAREW program will be based on this Jelcz vehicle., MBDA The resurgence of the short-range air defense, or SHORAD role, is something we have discussed at The War Zone in the past, notably in relation to the U.S. Army’s gaps in this regard. Moreover, the growing threat from peer and near-peer opponents means that, once again, more traditional threats like low-flying fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, and cruise missiles are also making a resurgence. After many years of operations in mainly uncontested environments, the challenge of guaranteeing air superiority, especially over large areas, has come back into focus. While the British Army may lack the ground-based long-range air defense systems of many of its allies and potential opponents, the Sky Sabre will offer enhanced protection across lower tiers as the U.K. Armed Forces at large continue to recalibrate toward tackling more sophisticated aerial threats.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",Finland Chooses F-35 As Its Next Fighter: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-35A stealth jet looks to have secured Finland’s highly anticipated tender for a new multirole fighter , according to initial media reports from the country. While the Finnish Ministry of Defense has yet to comment, an official decision on the roughly $12 billion competition is due before the end of the year, with signs already pointing to another victory for the Joint Strike Fighter, which was selected by Switzerland earlier this year. The Finnish newspaper Iltalehti reported yesterday that “several foreign and security policy sources” had confirmed the Finnish Defense Forces’ recommendation of the F-35 as Finland’s next fighter. Apparently, the same sources pointed to the F-35’s “capability and expected long lifespan” as key reasons for it winning through in favor of the rival Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , Dassault Aviation Rafale , Eurofighter Typhoon , and the Saab Gripen E . Final quotes from each of these manufacturers were received in April. While there is no fixed figure on the number of jets to be acquired, it seems this will be in the region of 64 aircraft. Two U.S. Air Force F-35As, from Hill Air Force Base, Utah, right, fly in formation with two Finnish F/A-18C Hornets, left, while en route to Turku, Finland, in June 2019, in support of a Theater Security Package., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Jovante Johnson The reports suggest that, now that the Finnish Defense Forces have made their decision, the country’s Ministry of Defense will prepare a procurement proposal for the government to approve. This is expected to be a formality, although lawmakers could theoretically still try and push for an alternative. Nevertheless, sources have told Iltalehti that the government is set to formally confirm the F-35 decision within the next 10 days, after having informed the U.S. government. Lt. Gen. Eric Fick, Program Executive Officer for the F-35 Joint Program Office, confirmed that the Finnish government had not yet notified its U.S. counterpart about the decision but said he would contact the Finnish government today. I asked the Pentagon's F-35 program head Lt. Gen. Eric Fick whether the Finnish government has notified the US government of the F-35's selection. Fick laughed and said not yet. He wasn't tracking these reports but says he's going to reach out to the Finnish government today. https://t.co/ZeJ3ZG6bE9 — Valerie Insinna (@ValerieInsinna) December 6, 2021 Last month, a senior representative from the Swiss Ministry of Defense visited Finland, apparently to discuss F-35 costs with the head of the Resource Policy Department at the Finnish Ministry of Defense, Raimo Jyväsjärvi. In both countries, the new aircraft would replace existing F/A-18C/D fighter fleets. The Iltalehti report states that annual operating costs “are within the framework set by the tender, according to which operating costs should not exceed 10 percent of the Defense Forces’ peacetime budget. In that case, they should not exceed 250 million Euros,” or just under $282 million at the present rate of conversion. But at this stage, it’s not clear how Finnish officials assessed the operating costs. Compared to similar figures from Norway and Switzerland, however, there would appear to be some question marks about the calculation, which may have involved buying a smaller number of jets or reducing flying hours in favor of in-simulator training. The operating cost issue has long been a matter of intense discussion for Finland and a growing concern for existing Joint Strike Fighter operators, including the United States and other new customers . @CorporalFrisk @iltalehti_fi Re your overall points that a) F-35 cost data is all over the shop, b) that Finnish justification of costs might be insanely optimistic, bordering naive, have a look at this: pic.twitter.com/WF3tI0z2Jk — Francis Tusa (@FTusa284) December 6, 2021 Finland’s tender to acquire a new fighter, to replace the current fleet of upgraded F/A-18C/D “legacy” Hornets — 55 single-seaters and seven two-seaters — is known as HX. Launched in 2015, it has been characterized by efforts to make it transparent and fair. The apparent leak that revealed the selection of the F-35 is therefore somewhat surprising. The timing is interesting as well, coming on Sunday, ahead of Finland’s December 6 Independence Day, when government and Ministry of Defense officials will not be in their offices. Arguably, the F-35 was always the most likely candidate for Finland’s new fighter. Finnish Air Force ‘legacy’ Hornets are prepared for flight during the Frisian Flag exercise at Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands, in April 2012., U.S. AIR FORCE The Super Hornet, while making sense from the point of view of commonality with the current legacy Hornet, is perhaps hamstrung by the fact the U.S. Navy, as its largest customer, is already looking to cease ordering the jets . The Navy’s fiscal year 2021 budget submission called for Super Hornet purchases to end after that budget year, overturning previous plans to continue with multi-year procurement from FY 2022 to FY 2024. Instead, the Navy is looking to direct funds to the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, among others. The Super Hornet had also included the option of the EA-18G Growler , which would have provided Finland with a new dedicated electronic attack capability. In its favor, the Super Hornet has a growing export base, with deliveries to Kuwait due shortly, and the possibility of a German order in the coming months. The Rafale and Typhoon, despite recent lucrative orders in the Middle East , represent previous-generation types and, despite their undoubted qualities, like the Super Hornet, they lack some of the high-end capabilities of the fifth-generation F-35. Perhaps the contender with the most to be disappointed about is Saab. The Swedish firm’s Gripen E was seen as having a good chance to win in Finland, the two countries sharing a border, a neutral position outside of NATO, and their air forces undertaking regular joint exercises, sharing each other’s facilities and airspaces. The Saab offer also included the same company’s GlobalEye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft. The Gripen E fighter and GlobalEye radar plane that comprised the Saab offer for HX., Saab “We have handed a very strong and competitive offer to Finland consisting of 64 Gripen E aircraft, two GlobalEyes, an extensive weapons package, and an industrial participation program that will ensure a security of supply for Finland over time,” Jonas Hjelm, Saab’s Senior Vice President and head of Saab Business Area, Aeronautics, said earlier this year . Should Finland move forward with its reported F-35 plans, it will be buying into a multinational military and industrial effort that’s gearing up to ensure the aircraft remains in service and viable well beyond the middle of this century. The Finnish Air Force, despite being outside NATO, already trains alongside the alliance and, with the Hornet, has an established industrial relationship with the United States. The then U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, General David L. Goldfein (left), after an F/A-18D training flight with Finnish Air Chief Major General Pasi Jokinen in May 2019., U.S. Air Force/Charles Pope While the legacy Hornet was originally procured by Finland as a pure air-defense fighter, the fleet has been successively upgraded to include a potent long-range air-to-ground capability. This is seen as vital to defending the country’s extensive territory against any possible aggression, from peacetime aerial incursion all the way up to a large-scale invasion, especially considering the small size of Finland’s standing army compared to Russia’s, for example. A decision in favor of the F-35 also points to wider strategic concerns within Finland, a country that borders Russia, with its own fast-developing military capabilities and growing geopolitical interests in the Nordic and Arctic regions, and in the Baltic . Due to its geography, parts of Finland fall within, or could fall within, Russian anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) ‘bubbles,’ providing another argument for the procurement of a stealthy fighter. Expanding these capabilities has very likely been a key factor in the HX decision-making. One of two armed Russian Su-27 Flankers that supposedly ventured into Finland’s airspace in October 2016, photographed from a Finnish F/A-18 were scrambled to intercept them., Finnish Government With that in mind, the F-35 package prepared for Finland by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) includes, among others, 100 AGM-154C-1 Joint Standoff Weapons ( JSOW ), 200 AGM-158B-2 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles — Extended Range ( JASSM-ER ), plus 120 guidance kits for the GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ). While these same weapons are already available to the Finnish legacy Hornet and were also included in the Super Hornet offer, the ability to launch all of them but the JASSM-ER from a stealth jet adds a significant new dimension, one that’s unique to the F-35 among types currently on the market. For Finland in particular, the combination of stealthy long-range weapons and a low-observable platform with which to deliver them arguably provides a more robust potential means to break down, or at least seriously degrade a hostile A2/AD network. This can be done without a high degree of low-observability as well, especially with the help of high-end electronic warfare support, but the proximities to Russia at play could still put fourth-generation fighters at greater risk. F-35As from Hill Air Force make the first visit to Finland by any stealth fighter, during the Turku Airshow in 2019: The same package outlined the sale of up to 64 conventional take-off and landing F-35A variants, with a total estimated cost of $12.5 billion. While this figure is above the limit imposed on the total cost of the program, such DSCA packages often include additional products or services that aren’t ultimately procured. With the HX decision looming, the Finnish government in September approved an increase to its 2022 defense procurement budget to cover preliminary costs associated with buying the new fighters. Officially speaking, key criteria for the HX decision comprise the following: military capability, security of supply, industrial cooperation, procurement and life-cycle costs, and security and defense policy implications. Considering that the F-35 apparently met the life-cycle cost requirement, it’s perhaps not surprising that the Lockheed Martin product seems to have won the backing of the Finnish Defense Forces. Apparent success for the Joint Strike Fighter in the Finnish tender comes just days after Canada’s future fighter competition became a two-horse race between the F-35A and the Gripen E after the Super Hornet was knocked out of the running to find a replacement for the existing CF-18 Hornet fleet. While we await confirmation from the Finnish authorities as to the outcome of the HX competition, there are strong indications at this stage that indeed the F-35 will be the jet that replaces Finland’s legacy Hornet, the last examples of which are scheduled to be retired by 2030.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 4, 2021",NATO Pushes Back Against Russian President Putin’s ‘Red Lines’ Over Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary-General of NATO, has categorically rejected Russia’s right to dictate how Ukraine does or doesn’t interact with the alliance. This comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that an expansion of NATO’s presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Moscow, would be a “red line” issue for the Kremlin. All of this follows major Russian troop movements that have prompted concerns that a new, larger-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, may come in a matter of weeks . Stoltenberg made his remarks to reporters earlier today in Riga, Latvia, where the top diplomats from all of NATO’s 30 members have been meeting to discuss the situation surrounding Ukraine, as well as the current Belarusian border crisis and arms control issues, among other matters. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who attended this gathering, has raised concerns in the past, as have others, that what is happening along Belarus’ western borders with NATO member states, which you can read more about here , appears to be a deliberate distraction from Russian moves around Ukraine. The NATO chief says the whole idea of Russia having a sphere of influence ""is not acceptable"". @jensstoltenberg says: ""They try to re-establish some kind of acceptance that Russia has a right to control what neighbours do or not do. 1/ — Deborah Haynes (@haynesdeborah) December 1, 2021 "".., trying to establish what Norway, as a small, independent country can do or not do – and that is exactly the same for Ukraine"" 2/2 — Deborah Haynes (@haynesdeborah) December 1, 2021 ""So this idea that NATO support to a sovereign nation is a provocation is just wrong. It is to respect the sovereignty of the will of the Ukrainian people. So I think that tells more about Russia than about NATO. NATO is a defensive alliance. NATO is not a threat to anyone. 3/ — Deborah Haynes (@haynesdeborah) December 1, 2021 “It’s only Ukraine and 30 NATO allies that decides when Ukraine is ready to join NATO. Russia has no veto, Russia has no say and Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors,” Stoltenberg said. “They try to re-establish some kind of acceptance that Russia has a right to control what neighbors do or not do.” “I myself come from a small country bordering Russia, and I’m very glad that our NATO allies have never respected that Russia has the kind of right to establish a sphere of influence in the north, trying to decide what Norway as a small independent country can do or not do,” the Secretary-General, who is Norwegian, continued. “And that’s exactly the same for Ukraine.” “So this idea that NATO support to a sovereign nation is a provocation is just wrong,” he added. “It’s to respect the sovereignty of the will of the Ukrainian people. So I think that tells more about Russia than about NATO.” This is not the first time Stoltenberg has spoken out against countries establishing spheres of influence over smaller nations, nor is this the first time Russia has criticized NATO’s involvement in Ukraine and the Ukrainian government’s interest in joining the alliance. However, his comments today follow remarks from Russian President Putin yesterday during an online investment forum in which he declared that any new deployments of NATO forces and materiel to Ukraine would be crossing a “red line” for his country. He specifically highlighted concerns about the potential arrival of long-range hypersonic missiles with the ability to hit Moscow in “five minutes.” Putin says his ""red line"" in Ukraine would be Nato weapons, like the missile defense in Romania & Poland: ""If missile strike systems appear in Ukraine, the flight time to Moscow will be 7-10 minutes, or 5 with hypersonic weapons"" pic.twitter.com/5HoixjAPhu — Alec Luhn (@AlecLuhn) November 30, 2021 “The emergence of such threats represents a ‘red line’ for us,” Putin said . “I hope that it will not get to that and common sense and responsibility for their own countries and the global community will eventually prevail.” He also reiterated criticisms about NATO exercises and other movements near Russia’s borders. For weeks now, Putin and other Russian officials have rejected concerns about Russia’s military movements near Ukraine and have sought to frame the alliance’s actions as being the real source of provocations in the region. This is a common rhetorical tack that the Kremlin has taken on many issues in the past to deflect from its own malign activities. Various NATO members, including the United States and Canada , do have established security assistance missions in Ukraine that include rotating troop deployments. Exercises involving Ukraine and NATO nations are not uncommon , either. Though ties between the Ukrainian military and the alliance go back decades, this cooperation grew in the aftermath of Russia’s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Since then, the Kremlin has also been actively supporting ostensibly local “separatist” groups , which have strong ties to Russian intelligence agencies, in their fight against Ukrainian government forces in that country’s eastern Donbass region. A U.S. Army paratrooper, at left, together with a Ukrainian soldier assigned to a combined Ukrainian-Lithuanian-Polish unit during Exercise Rapid Trident 21 in Ukraine in September 2021., U.S. Army There have certainly been calls for NATO to send forces to Ukraine to help deter Russia from taking any new military action, but, despite reported deliberations , there have been no indications yet that any member states are actually preparing to do so. There have also been reported discussions among NATO members, including the United States , about increasing deliveries of weapons and other equipment to the Ukrainian military. However, there does not appear to be any discussion about a NATO deployment to Ukraine of ground-based surface-to-surface missiles able to strike Moscow. The American-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is the only ground-based weapon anywhere in service within the alliance that would even have the capability to hit the Russian capital from Ukrainian territory, and, even then, the launches would have to occur very close to Ukraine’s northern border with Russia for that to work. ATACMS’ maximum range is around 310 miles, while the shortest distance between Moscow and the Ukrainian border is around 280 miles. For its part, Ukraine has threatened to use its own short-range ballistic missiles against targets in Russia in the event of a full-scale open conflict between the two countries. With all this in mind, Putin’s comments about this notional missile deployment are extremely curious, and there is the distinct possibility that he might have been making references to other current or future NATO capabilities. The Russian president might be trying to leverage the situation to secure commitments from NATO to limit the deployment anywhere in Europe of ground-based hypersonic missiles or other long-range missiles that the United States now has in development. He has already threatened in the past to adopt a standing posture targeting the United States with hypersonic weapons if the U.S. military deploys missiles that had been prohibited under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, in Europe. The U.S. Army expects to field a variety of new missiles , including hypersonic types , that would have previously been banned under the INF in the coming years and just recently re-activated an artillery command in Europe to, among other things, manage the future deployment of such weapons to the region. U.S. Army soldiers uncase the colors of the 56th Artillery Command during a ceremony in Germany marking the re-activation of the unit in November 2021., U.S. Army Putin could be trying to similarly force NATO’s hand in some way on the matter of new air and missile defenses in or around Ukraine. A new U.S. military Aegis Ashore missile defense site is slated to become operational next year , joining another Aegis Ashore facility already in Romania . The Russian government has long alleged that Aegis Ashore could be used to launch surface-to-surface missiles, as well as anti-missile interceptors, something the U.S. government has categorically denied . Last year, Putin put forward an offer to limit his country’s deployment of 9M729 ground-launched cruise missiles , which violated the terms of the INF and led to the collapse of that treaty, in exchange for the ability to inspect Aegis Ashore sites in Europe. Regardless, there has been no talk of establishing an Aegis Ashore site in Ukraine. There have been calls, including from members of Congress in the United States, to bolster the Ukrainian military’s own air and missile defense capabilities. Separately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said yesterday, seemingly unprompted, that he might ask Putin to deploy nuclear weapons to his country if similar systems appeared in neighboring Poland. There had been talk last year about the possibility of relocating U.S. B61 nuclear bombs from Germany to Poland if the German government decided to drop out of a NATO nuclear sharing agreement . Of course, Putin’s red lines could simply be designed to muddy the waters around his intentions regarding Ukraine. As The War Zone has explored in the past , the Kremlin certainly has reasons why it might be considering a new military intervention, chiefly a need to secure a ready source of fresh water for Crimea.

So despite uncertainty about intention, and timing, we must prepare for all contingencies while working to see to it that Russia reverses course.” “We’ve made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we’ve refrained from using in the past,” he added. NATO is “prepared to impose severe costs for further Russian aggression in Ukraine” and “prepared to reinforce its defenses on the eastern flank.” Small handful of House lawmakers just emerged from a classified briefing on Ukraine. Still lots of concern about potential military action by Russia, but it doesn’t appear that the U.S. has seen any substantial changes to Russian posture in the last week or so. — Katie Bo Lillis (@KatieBoLillis) December 1, 2021 The Kremlin might be content to try to bring down Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, including by leveraging internal discontent . Zelensky just recently accused Russia of attempting to launch a coup against him but has provided limited evidence of this so far. Questions have been raised about whether or not these allegations might be, at least in part, an effort to neuter Zelensky’s domestic political opponents, including oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Zelensky has said that Akhmetov’s name came up in relation to the apparent plot, but he has said he doesn’t believe that Ukraine’s richest man was involved directly. There was a protest in Kyiv today, the organizers of which accused Zelensky of making up the coup claims, but also saw speakers call out Russia’s aggression against the country.

This came after it emerged that Zelensky had fired Oleksandr Rusnak, the head of the SBU’s counterintelligence department, which officials in Ukraine insist is unrelated . Another possibility is that Putin’s red line comments might just be an appeal to the nationalist sentiments of domestic audiences. In an example of the often highly provocative rhetoric being pushed internally in Russia, Dmitry Kiselyov, a prominent host on the state-run Russia-1 television network, declared last week that the country could destroy the GPS satellite navigation constellation with anti-satellite weapons if NATO refused to respect the Kremlin’s previous red lines regarding Ukraine. This followed a widely condemned Russian test of a ground-launched anti-satellite interceptor on Nov. 15, which destroyed a defunct Soviet-era electronic intelligence satellite and created a dangerous cloud of debris. There is no indication whatsoever that this reflects actual Russian policy at present, and Kiselyov is well known for making these kinds of inflammatory, but unsubstantiated, pronouncements. He was previously responsible for an equally provocative segment back in 2019 in which he outlined various bases that Russian submarines could strike in the United States with Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in a future conflict. U.S. military facilities that had been closed for years at that point were bizarrely listed among the potential targets. All told, it remains to be seen how Putin’s newly declared “red lines” and the reaction from NATO will actually impact the still-evolving crisis in and around Ukraine.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At first glance, in what seems like something of a hugely ironic flashback to the headline-making loss of a secretive American RQ-170 Sentinel in Iranian territory exactly a decade ago to the day , one of Iran’s rather crude sub-scale knock-offs of the basic Sentinel airframe (we can’t stress basic enough here) appears to have crashed in the Iranian province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari. The province is located just to the southwest of Isfahan, which is largely understood to be an epicenter of Iran’s nuclear program and a key area of interest for U.S. intelligence. In fact, it is just the kind of nuclear installation that American RQ-170s were tasked with spying on when the one fell into Iranian hands ten years ago. The December 5th, 2011, RQ-170 ‘capture’ remains a huge source of pride and propaganda for the Iranian military. As such, one has to ask if this incident could be some sort of elaborate reenaction for propaganda purposes? Otherwise, it is an outright bizarre coincidence of almost unbelievable proportions. The actual RQ-170 Sentinel Iran recovered, seen above, still gets put on display for various events, especially those that celebrate the technological capabilities and prowess of Iran’s military and IRGC. As you can see, the aircraft has been through a lot of probing and prodding since we first saw it 10 years ago., Iranian State Media The drone at the scene of the supposed crash looks to be a Shahed-191. Iran has various RQ-170-influenced flying-wing drone variants of different sizes, of which this type is the second-largest at about 2/3rds scale. By our estimation, its wingspan is around 24 feet, compared to the RQ-170’s roughly 38-foot span. “A provincial official has confirmed the emergency landing of the drone due to bad weather conditions in the region,” according to a report from the quasi-official Mehr news agency.

As in the 2011 incident, they loaded it onto a truck and at least tried to airlift it via an Mi-17 helicopter. The RQ-170 is built for its wings to be detached at prominent fuselage joints. Footage from the decade-old crash involving the actual RQ-170 showed an Iranian Mi-17 airlifting just the fuselage. In this case, the aircraft is totally intact, including its wings, which makes for a less than stable sling-load. Images from Iran’s recovery of the U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel 10 years ago., Iran State Media While none of Iran’s RQ-170-inspired creations come close to matching its actual capabilities, they have become a major threat due to their somewhat reduced radar signature and long-range . Israel has already identified these aircraft as a real issue it will likely continue to deal with and has already shot at least one down in its airspace. In addition, while Iran’s attempts to make these far less complex aircraft look like RQ-170 to an almost absurd degree, it is noteworthy that they have gotten the larger models to fly. Truly tailless flying-wing aircraft are notoriously unstable and the larger they get the more challenging it can be for them to reliably fly throughout their operating envelope. Iran appears to have overcome these historical hurdles, at least to some degree. There was also a strange report of an explosion near Natanz , another key Iranian nuclear facility that isn’t that far to the north of Isfahan, this weekend. Iran claims this was an air defense exercise that included the shoot-down of a drone. While the official line is that this was not related to the Shahed-191 ’emergency landing,’ it does seem a bit odd. Once again, the question is what actually happening here? Did a test or training flight of one of Iran’s RQ-170-inspired drones go terribly wrong on the most ironic of dates? Or is this some sort of spectacle recreating the loss of the American RQ-170 on the 10th anniversary of that historic event? We are leaning towards the latter. Iran does these kinds of things for major calendar milestones, especially recreating or reminding its citizens of significant military victories, or emulating ones it aspires to in the future, on key dates. Regardless, it is very suspect seeing these freakishly familiar images pop up on the tenth anniversary of the RQ-170 falling into Iranian hands.Â We will report back when we find out more about this strange incident.Â Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Up to 12 F-16s acquired from Norway will form part of an impressive private tactical jet air force, already one of the world’s largest, which also includes a dozen ex-South African Atlas Cheetahs , and 22 ex-Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms , plus assorted other subsonic jets, as well as a deep backstock of MiG-21s. Draken took to Facebook yesterday to announce it was buying the F-16s plus “supporting assets” in a deal signed with the government of Norway but which still requires approval from U.S. and Norwegian authorities. The value of the contract has not been revealed. A neat stacked formation of Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16AM/BM jets., Luftforsvaret “We are thrilled to have built a superb and lasting relationship with the people of Norway,” said Bill Tart, COO of Draken, in the statement. “The inclusion of the F-16s into the Draken fleet is transformational,” added Joe Ford, Draken’s CEO. Today, the Norwegian Defense Materiel Agency provided more details of the sale, noting that the jets could be delivered to Draken as early as next year and they will support training “against American fighter aircraft.” Headquartered at Lakeland Linder International Airport, in Lakeland, Florida, the company also provides contractor adversary services within Europe . “The F-16 has been a formidable capacity for the [Royal Norwegian Air Force, or RNoAF] and the defense of Norway,” the Defense Materiel Agency said in a statement on its website. “The F-16 has claimed sovereignty in Norwegian airspace, as well as participated in a number of national and international operations and exercises. In September 2019, Defense Materiel was commissioned by the Ministry of Defense to dispose of the aircraft after they were taken out of service at the end of 2021.” In fact, the last of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) F-16s are due to be withdrawn before the end of this year, after over 40 years of service, so technically they still have a few more weeks of operations ahead of them. From the beginning of next year, they will be replaced entirely by the F-35A stealth fighter , Norway being one of the biggest European customers for this type with 52 examples on order. A Royal Norwegian Air Force F-35A. , Luftforsvaret The Norwegian Ministry of Defense had already decided that it would try and sell its F-16s to allies after they completed their service. As well as the dozen or so jets for Draken, the Norwegian Minister of Defense Odd-Roger Enoksen confirmed that “there is a dialogue with NATO allies about the sale of several Norwegian F-16s.” “We are now continuing the work of selling as many of the remaining aircraft as possible and have expectations that this can be realized in the coming months,” said director Mette Sørfonden, director of the Defense Materiel Agency. Although old — the Norwegian Vipers were originally delivered from 1980, initially in Block 1 form — the fleet has been notably well looked after and has been successively upgraded. “The fighter aircraft are among the best maintained in the world and have a consistently high standard,” Sørfonden claims. RNoAF F-16s over Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom., Luftforsvaret Like the Dutch F-16s that Draken previously acquired, the RNoAF jets underwent the Mid-Life Update (MLU), bringing them from the original F-16A/B standard to what’s unofficially known as F-16AM/BM. This means the aircraft are broadly comparable to the U.S. Air Force’s F-16C/D Block 50/52 fleet. They have been fitted with a new modular mission computer, targeting pods, datalinks, GPS, night-vision goggle compatibility, and new precision-guided weapons. Improvements have continued to be introduced via successive software upgrades. By adding another batch of F-16s to its adversary fleet, Draken will keep pace with rival red air provider Top Aces , which is now operating the first of the 29 ex-Israeli F-16A/Bs acquired from Israel. One of the former Israeli F-16s now flown by Top Aces., KYLER NOE The move reflects the popularity of the Viper as a platform with which to meet the U.S. military’s growing demand for contract aggressor services, especially to fulfill the U.S. Air Force’s mammoth adversary air contract . As well as the former Norwegian F-16s, and the 12 already acquired from the Netherlands, Draken could expand its fleet still further, with the Dutch government having announced an option for the firm to acquire another 28 examples, which are planned to be retired from service by the end of 2024. As it stands, Draken’s fleet currently includes two supersonic fighter jets for adversary work: a dozen ex-South African Atlas Cheetahs , and 22 ex-Spanish Air Force Mirage F1Ms . One of the latter jets was lost in a fatal crash near Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, earlier this year. In addition, Draken operates subsonic A-4 Skyhawks , L-159 Honey Badgers, L-39s , and MB339s . The company also owns dozens of MiG-21s, although they are currently in storage. While the Cheetahs and Mirage F1s provide a high level of performance and are equipped with radars, the F-16 is the aggressor of choice for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy and its performance is legendary. It remains an ideal platform for training pilots of advanced U.S. fighters like the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor . The various advantages the F-16 offers in the red air environment are clear, especially when it comes to being able to ‘run down’ blue force fighters and other performance and capabilities advantages. With this in mind, there’s what seems like the growing realization that a place for a true fourth-generation fighter like the Viper exists for the most demanding of contracted aggressor work. Prior to the arrival of the F-16 on the private aggressor scene, ‘warmed over’ third-generation types fulfilled the most advanced contracted training missions. A U.S. Air Force F-16C aggressor jet from Eielson Air Force Base flies over the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, in 2019., U.S. Air Force Still, especially once upgrades have been made to these aging jets, engaging the services of these F-16s won’t come cheap. The acquisition and direct operating costs alone are significantly higher than their less complex third-generation fighter stablemates. However, if the U.S. military needs to properly push its pilots to the limits, and wants to increasingly rely more heavily on contractors to help it do so, then a platform of this type makes some sense — an A-4 or L-159, or even a Mirage F1, while cheaper in nearly every aspect, simply cannot replicate the same kinds of high-end threats. Clearly, the appetite for contractor adversary support is there, and the Draken fleet is set to be busy, not least with the U.S. Air Force’s $6.4-billion program that is providing red air support at 12 different airbases throughout the United States. Draken is among the companies to have received a share of this contract, together with Air USA , Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , Tactical Air Support , and Top Aces . The contract runs until October 2024 and is expected to involve between 40,000 to 50,000 flying hours per year. Barring any hurdles with U.S. government approvals, Draken now looks set to receive F-16s, from former Dutch and Norwegian stocks in 2022, suggesting that they could soon be plying their trade as bad guys during training and exercises before too long.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2020",Delivery Of The U.S. Coast Guard’s New Heavy Icebreaker Has Been Delayed Yet Again,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Coast Guard has quietly pushed back when it expects to receive its first new heavy icebreaker, also known as the Polar Security Cutter , or PSC, from 2024 to 2025. This raises questions about whether the ship will be ready before the USCGC Polar Star , the only operational heavy icebreaker the service has now, reaches the end of its viable service life, even after a planned major overhaul. The Coast Guard’s overall icebreaking capacity has become an increasingly pressing national security issue in recent years in large part due to the growing strategic significance of the Arctic region and the potential for conflict there. It’s unclear when the PSC delivery schedule got delayed. A review of archived copies of the Coast Guard’s official website for the program shows that the date was updated there sometime between Sept. 27 and Sept. 29. Admiral Karl Schultz, Commandant of the Coast Guard, had not included a projected date of any kind for when he expected the first of these to be delivered in his prepared remarks at a hearing on the readiness of his service in April. The year before, he had said that the first of these icebreakers could potentially be ready in 2023 . A rendering of VT Halter’s Polar Security Cutter design., Technology Associated, Inc., via VT Halter Marine The U.S. Navy, which is managing the program together with the Coast Guard, awarded the first contract for the lead PSC to VT Halter Marine in 2019, at which time the goal was to take delivery of the ship in 2024. This was already a one-year delay in the original timeline, which envisioned the arrival of three PSCs in 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively. There were at that time and continue to be “financial incentives for earlier delivery” included in that deal, according to the Navy and the Coast Guard. There were already hints of a new delay earlier this year, based on the apparent slipping in the schedule for when the first steel would be cut for the ship. That milestone marks the very start of the actual construction of a vessel. As of this week, however, the first PSC is “still in the design phase” and VT Halter Marine “is working toward completing the necessary work to begin construction,” according to a statement that the Coast Guard gave to ArcticToday . That outlet was among the first to note that the service had started saying 2025, rather than 2024, was now the expected delivery date. It’s unclear what issue or issues may have been responsible for the new delay. The Coast Guard and the Navy had sought to keep costs and schedule risk low by considering PSCs based on relatively mature parent designs. VT Halter Marine’s offer was derived from a planned ship, the Polarstern II , a planned ice-capable research vessel for the German government. However, that program was thrown into uncertainty last year, with German authorities canceling the tender over legal issues. “To what degree was Polarstern II ’s design developed at the time it was used as the parent design for developing the PSC design? How much of Polarstern II ’s detail design and construction plan was completed at that time?” the Congressional Research Service posed as potential questions for American legislators to consider in its latest report on the PSC program, released in October , which did not include any mention of the latest delay. “How closely related is the PSC’s design to Polarstern II ’s design? How many changes were made to Polarstern II ’s design to develop the PSC design? What were these changes, and what technical, schedule, and cost risks, if any, might arise from them?” It was reported in January that VT Halter Marine was still getting things ready to begin construction of the first PSC. It is set to be one of the heaviest ships that its yard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, has ever built, which has required new infrastructure capable of handling that weight. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, had raised concerns about the potential for delays in the PSC program, including simply as a result of the general complexities of shipbuilding, in its own report back in 2018. GAO had also warned that any such schedule slips would raise the risk of the Coast Guard being left without any operational heavy icebreakers. At that time, USCGC Polar Star was set to be retired in 2020 absent plans for a major life-extension effort. A graphic GAO included in its 2018 report, underscoring concerns about a potential heavy icebreaker gap in the event of any schedule delays in the Polar Security Cutter program., GAO In January, the Coast Guard announced it had awarded a contract , worth up to  $119.6 million, to Mare Island Dry Dock, LLC, of Vallejo, California, to conduct a Sevice Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul of the Polar Star . The expectation, based on requirements Congress set in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year, is that this will keep the ship in service through at least the end of 2025. The USCGC Polar Star ., USCG The issue here is that Polar Star , which first entered service in 1976 and has become very hard to operate and maintain , will still have to be out of service for at least some amount of time while the SLEP work is performed and there is no heavy icebreaker to take its place. Her sister ship, USCGC Polar Sea , remains in inventory, but has not been operational since 2010 and is nothing more than a source of spare parts today. The Coast Guard does also have a single medium icebreaker, the USCGC Healy , but it has more limited capabilities compared to the Polar Star . The USCGC Healy helps free a Russian-flagged tanker from the ice near Alaska in 2012., USCG Another Coast Guard icebreaker, USCGC Mackinaw , is limited to operations on the Great Lakes and is not included in the service’s own accounting of “major icebreakers” in service around the world. Various agencies elsewhere within the U.S. government have utilized contractor-owned and operated ice-capable ships in the past, as well. “By replacing obsolete, unsupportable, or maintenance-intensive equipment, the Coast Guard will mitigate the risk of lost operational days due to unplanned maintenance or system failures,” the service said when it announced the SLEP contract earlier this year. “The contracted SLEP work items and recurring maintenance will take place within a five-year, annually phased production schedule running from 2021 through 2025. Each phase will be coordinated so that operational commitments such as Operation Deep Freeze will still be met.” Operation Deep Freeze is the nickname for U.S. military support for U.S. government activities in Antarctica. In June 2020, then-President Donald Trump ordered the Coast Guard to explore the possibility of buying nuclear-powered icebreakers , a type of ship that only Russia currently operates . The next month, Trump suggested there were new plans to acquire 10 additional icebreakers from an unspecified source. Whether or not that was true, nothing has emerged since then to indicate that anyone seriously pursued such a proposal. The video below shows the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker Arktika, which is currently the largest icebreaker of any kind in the world. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lCrRtVyY9Xo The United States was already in desperate need of new icebreakers two years ago when VT Halter Marine got the contract for the first PSC. That demand is likely to grow in the coming years. Increased military, as well as commercial competition in the highly strategic Arctic region alone will increase requirements for icebreaking support. For years now, receding ice in the Arctic due to global climate change has opened up new potential shipping routes , as well as access to resources that could be exploited, ranging from oil to fish . This in turn has prompted concerns that subsequent competition in the region could lead to conflict . Many other Arctic nations, even ones smaller than the United States, operate larger fleets of icebreakers. Russia, in particular, has dozens of icebreakers in service now and is in the process of expanding and modernizing its ice-capable fleets, including the addition of new nuclear-powered and missile-armed types . A US Coast Guard graphic showing major icebreakers in service around the world, as well as those expected to enter service in the near term, circa 2017., USCG Russia is in the process of a dramatic expansion of its overall presence in this region. This could ultimately include the establishment of a network of new anti-access and area-denial capabilities in the High North. China also wants to expand its presence in the Arctic and is looking to build new icebreakers to support those ambitions. Right now, it should still hopefully be possible for the Coast Guard to get its first PSC before the USCGC Polar Star needs to be retired. However, if the delivery schedule gets pushed back any further, the service could find itself without any heavy icebreakers at a time when it already needs more capacity in this regard.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 7, 2021","Russia Bolsters Supply Lines, Deploys Medical Units Near Ukraine As Invasion Fears Grow: Report (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. intelligence shows that the Russian military has established significant supply lines for fuel and other support, which now also include various medical units, for its forces arrayed around the country’s borders with Ukraine, according to a report today from CNN . Though much attention has been paid to the Kremlin’s positioning of heavy armor , artillery, and even long-range missiles in these same areas, logistical and medical support would be essential for sustaining any new major military intervention into Ukrainian territory. Fears that Russia could be preparing to stage a new invasion of Ukraine as early as January have been building for weeks now . NATO, of which Ukraine is not a member, pushed back against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s setting of new “red lines” over the alliance’s potential involvement in the brewing crisis earlier this week. Russia and Ukraine have already been deeply embroiled in a conflict since 2014, when the Kremlin launched an operation to seize the Crimean Peninsula and then subsequently deployed troops to actively support ostensibly local “separatists” fighting the government in Kyiv. “The current levels of equipment stationed in the area could supply front-line forces for seven to 10 days and other support units for as long as a month, according to one source familiar with the matter,” according to CNN . The outlet said that a senior official in President Joe Biden’s administration had also disclosed that the U.S. government had “seen additional Russia troops added to the border region in recent days,” but did not provide any additional details. “Russia’s capabilities would be equivalent to a modern-day blitzkrieg,” Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat who is on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN, adding that the Russians have positioned themselves to attack Ukraine “when they want.” There has been at least one classified briefing regarding the situation in and around Ukraine this week given to some members of the U.S. House of Representatives, which took place on Dec. 1. “It doesn’t appear that the U.S. has seen any substantial changes to Russian posture in the last week or so,” C NN ‘s Katie Bo Lillis Tweeted afterward based on comments from the lawmakers who were present. This would indicate that the newly reported arrival of logistical and medical elements in the region either occurred prior to that or that it happened very recently. Regardless of the exact timeline, that those supporting elements are now near Russia’s borders with Ukraine is a significant development. It is a notable difference between publicly available reports about the situation now as compared to the deployment of large numbers of Russian forces to the same general region earlier this year . Those previous troop movements had also prompted concerns that the Kremlin was preparing to launch a new large-scale military operation against its neighbor. “Pentagon officials say the current intelligence does not indicate that this land force is prepared for offensive operations in the next few days, because there is no evidence of the logistics, spare parts, fuel, and medical capability that would need to be pre-positioned,” CNN had reported on April 14 , amid that previous spike in tensions. “But the concern remains that there are also no indicators of Russia reducing its forces or signaling a de-escalation. And events on the ground can change quickly, officials caution, noting that the intelligence assessments typically project out for only a few days at a time.” Though there ultimately ended up not being any major confrontation in the spring, the Russian military left significant stockpiles of armor and other heavy weapons and equipment in place in the region, and not all the units that had flooded into the area went back to their normal garrisons. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared that Russia had arrayed units with almost 100,000 troops in total around its borders. Ukrainian authorities, as well as American officials, among others, continue to stress that there are no clear indications that the Russian government is firmly committed to a new major military operation in Ukraine. At the same time, the U.S. government and NATO have been outspoken in warning the Kremlin against doing so and that there would be serious repercussions. The United States is putting together “the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” President Biden said today. He did not elaborate on what these initiatives might include, but there have been reports already that the U.S. government has threatened to hit the Kremlin with more sanctions in the event it launches a new invasion of Ukraine. There is talk of a potential meeting of some kind between Biden and Putin as early as next week about the crisis. “Despite a massive Russian disinformation campaign, Ukraine in no way poses a threat to Russia,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said yesterday while attending the 28th Ministerial Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Stockholm, Sweden. “The only threat is that of renewed Russian aggression towards Ukraine.” For some time now, Russian officials have been actively seeking to present Ukraine, as well as NATO, as being the real source of the latest tensions in the region. This is a common rhetorical tactic on the part of the Kremlin to deflect questions and criticism from the international community about worrying military movements and other malign activities it is engaged in. Blinken also met directly with Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the OSCE gathering to discuss the situation in and around Ukraine, but nothing of substance emerged from those talks. “We’ve made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we’ve refrained from using in the past,” Blinken said the day before during a meeting of top NATO diplomats in Latvia. He added the alliance was “prepared to impose severe costs for further Russian aggression in Ukraine” and “prepared to reinforce its defenses on the eastern flank.” All of this follows Putin declaring his country’s lastest red lines in relation to Ukraine earlier this week, warning in particular against major NATO deployments to Ukraine. While NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg pushed back forcefully against these statements, there is no actual indication that any NATO members are actively considering expanding their military presence inside Ukraine proper. There are reports that members of NATO — the United States, in particular — are looking to step up other kinds of assistance to Ukraine’s military, including the delivery of weapons, ammunition, and other equipment. The United States just recently delivered two ex-U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats that are set to enter Ukrainian Navy service and has continued to deliver ammunition and other supplies as part of pre-existing agreements. “The U.S. is planning to send more anti-tank weapons like Javelin missiles,” CNN reported today. Ukraine already has some stockpiles of Javelin anti-tank missiles. Officials in that country say they have started employing them against Russian-supported forces in the eastern part of the country following the lifting of earlier U.S. government prohibitions against doing so last year. These are very capable modern guided anti-tank weapons that have long been touted as significantly bolstering Ukraine’s ability to challenge future Russian aggression. However, the United States “has for now backed off of providing Ukraine with surface-to-air missiles, like [shoulder-fired, man-portable] Stingers , which Russia would view as provocative,” according to CNN . It is well known that Ukraine has limited air and missile defense capabilities, which would present major vulnerabilities during any future conflict with Russia. There have been recent calls in the United States to provide Ukrainian forces with new surface-to-air missiles to help address these concerns. What kind of deterrent effect, if any, additional military assistance, threats of sanctions, and other initiatives emanating from the United States and other NATO members might have in the end very much remains to be seen. As The War Zone has explored in its past reporting of this crisis, a number of geopolitical factors, together with domestic considerations, are likely combining to push the Kremlin increasingly toward some kind of action no matter what the consequences. At the same time, Russia has non-military options to try to destabilize the government in Kyiv, with the hope that its collapse could lead to a more pro-Russian regime. A realistic threat of a new invasion, even if it never comes, puts its own pressure on Ukrainian authorities and their international partners. Continually conducting maneuvers that suggest such an operation might be imminent, but not following through could have a desensitizing effect, as well. What is increasingly clear, as underscored by this latest report that logistical and medical capabilities have been deployed near Ukraine, is that the Kremlin is posturing itself to keep the invasion option wide open. Updated 8:50 PM EST: The Washington Post has published a story late today that offers details about a U.S. intelligence assessment that indicates Russia is putting the pieces into place to launch a large-scale intervention into Ukraine involving at least 175,000 personnel on the ground. It also says that American officials believe that there are around 70,000 Russian troops positioned near the country’s borders with Ukraine now, a lower estimate than the ones that have been given out publicly by the Ukrainian government. However, some of the discrepancies may be due to the Kremlin’s regular movement of forces in the region in order “to obfuscate intentions and to create uncertainty,” according to the report. “The Russian plans call for a military offensive against Ukraine as soon as early 2022 with a scale of forces twice what we saw this past spring during Russia’s snap exercise near Ukraine’s borders,” an official from President Joe Biden’s administration said, according to The Washington Post . “The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery, and equipment.” Earlier this year, “the Russian troops worked out the issues of creating strike groups near the borders of our state, mobilization measures, logistical support of groups, [and] transfer of significant military contingents, including by air,” a Ukrainian official said separately, the Washington Post reported. “Additionally, in the past month, our information indicates Russian influence proxies and media outlets have started to increase content denigrating Ukraine and NATO, in part to pin the blame for a potential Russian military escalation on Ukraine.” “Recent information also indicates that Russian officials proposed adjusting Russia’s information operations against Ukraine to emphasize the narrative that Ukrainian leaders had been installed by the West, harbored a hatred for the ‘Russian world,’ and were acting against the interests of the Ukrainian people,” they continued. All this being said, U.S. and Ukrainian officials continue to state publicly that it is unclear if Russian President Vladimir Putin has fully committed to executing this operation. If the Kremlin does truly intend to launch this invasion, it would still need to deploy around 100,000 additional personnel, per the U.S. government’s assessment. Exactly what kinds of units are being discussed here is unclear, and there have also been reports of significant mobilizations of reserve units in Russia. All told, the 175,000 number likely does not reflect all of the forces that the Russians would bring to bear in an actual conflict. Again, whatever Putin’s plans may actually be and what his policy objectives actually are, it does seem clear that moves are being made to keep the option of major military action open and viable.

Bush (CVN-77) sometime this week. The unmanned aircraft will not undergo flight testing from the carrier quite yet, but the Navy will begin to explore how the drones will be integrated onboard the ship, including moving them around on the elevators and in the hangar deck. USS George H.W. Bush is the first of four Navy flattops set to be modified with the Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control System, or UMCS, necessary to operate the MQ-25. The Stingray demonstrator has also undergone modifications ahead of these trials, including a new system integrated to enable personnel to remotely move it around the deck. On Nov. 22, the Navy had announced that it, in cooperation with Boeing, was wrapping up various deck handling tests on the ground at Chambers Field, which is part of Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. George H.W. Bush is homeported in Norfolk.

As of mid-September, 36 test sorties had been completed, plus many more hours achieved with simulations using MQ-25 digital models. The MQ-25 T1 conducts aerial refueling trials with a Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet in summer 2021., U.S. Navy As well as the hard-working T1, production has begun on the first batch of four Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) aircraft that are being completed under a 2018 contract award , to which another three MQ-25s have since been added. The EMD aircraft will conduct more experimental work at the Boeing facility in St. Louis, Missouri before moving to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, where the flight test program will commence. It will also include testing periods spent at Lakehurst in New Jersey and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida . A deck-handling demonstration of the MQ-25 T1 back in January 2018 at the Boeing facility in St. Louis, Missouri., Boeing The first of these EMD aircraft is expected to be delivered in the fall of next year, a timeline that’s been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as technical issues that have emerged with drone itself. Boeing paused work in the past to optimize the weight and strength of the drone, as well as to address an unspecified quality issue. Despite these hiccups, the Navy is looking forward to fielding its first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, with plans calling for a total of  72 MQ-25s, and an initial operating capacity slated for Fiscal Year 2025. MQ-25 T1 below decks in the USS George H.W. Bush ., NAVAIR As well as the pioneering introduction of a carrier-based drone, the Navy will also be getting its hands on an organic dedicated tanker capability for the first time in years, allowing tanker-tasked F/A-18E/F jets to return to their core missions. That will not only expand the combat capabilities of Strike Fighter Squadrons but also reduce fatigue across the Super Hornet fleet. As the Pentagon continues to focus on the possibility of future conflict in the Asia Pacific region, the requirement for aerial tanking will only become more urgent, to extend the reach of carrier-based assets. For the Super Hornet, that requirement is even more critical now that plans to install conformal fuel tanks on the jets have been abandoned . On top of the core refueling mission, the MQ-25 is ultimately expected to take on additional roles as well, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) duties. While seeing a drone craned onto a supercarrier is a novelty as of today, if all goes as expected in the MQ-25 program, these aircraft are set to play a central role in the carrier air wings of the future. Indeed, the Navy expects to eventually shift to a 40-60 unmanned-manned split, before achieving a longer-term goal of 60-40 in favor of drones. Those scenarios paint a very different picture to previous concepts of how a carrier air wing might appear around 2030: U.S. Navy With this in mind, beyond its key mission set, the MQ-25 is acting as a critical stepping stone towards fulfilling other air combat roles with carrier-based drones. So, it might not be set to fly from a carrier deck quite yet, but with an MQ-25 demonstrator now embarked in a carrier for the first time, we have a glimpse into the future of the carrier air wing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 16, 2021",The U.S. Military Has A Missing Explosives Problem,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report details how at least hundreds of pounds of U.S. military explosives and other ordnance, including bricks of C4 , artillery shells, grenades, and rockets, as well as ancillary items like blasting caps and detonating cord, have been stolen, lost, or otherwise ended up unaccounted for over the last decade or so. Officials have downplayed these losses, but inherent issues in keeping track of stockpiles of explosives combined with spotty recordkeeping can only raise questions about the accuracy of that accounting and the effectiveness of existing security procedures. The Associated Press today published the results of an investigation it conducted into explosives that have gone unaccounted for across all branches of U.S. military, with the exception of the U.S. Space Force, between 2010 and 2020. Space Force was only formally established as a separate branch within the Department of the Air Force in December 2019. This new story, which is well worth reading in full, follows a report the AP put out earlier this year about theft and other losses of firearms and other weapons throughout the U.S. military in the same timeframe. A US Marine prepares blocks of TNT explosives during a training exercise at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia., USMC The Army provided data to the AP in the form of a chart listing almost 1,900 separate instances of lost explosives, 1,066 involved C4 or TNT. “Other categories included artillery, mortars, land mines, grenades, rockets and armor-piercing 40 mm grenades shot from a launcher,” according to the report. “In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Marine Corps released data that was too unclear to calculate a precise tally,” the piece added. “ AP ’s rough analysis showed that thousands of armor-piercing grenades and hundreds of pounds of plastic explosives were reported lost or stolen.” Data from the Air Force said that the service had lost track of approximately 50 pounds of C4, as well as 800 feet of detonating cord and “several” 40mm grenades. The Navy responded to the AP ‘s requests for information by saying that the service had only had 20 hand grenades stolen between 2010 and 2020. On the face of it, these losses seem negligible and significant amounts of what is known to have gone missing has ultimately been recovered. The Army “has maintained proper accountability of 99.999984% of munitions,” Lieutenant Colonel Brandon Kelley, a spokesperson for the service, told AP , adding that around half of the items reported as missing between 2010 and 2020 had been recovered. “The Air Force does very well regarding accountability of explosives,” Sarah Fiocco, another spokesperson, said in a separate statement when asked about that service’s losses. The Navy said that all but two of its missing grenades had been found. At the same time, the AP investigation found that the very nature of how the U.S. military stores and issues explosives, especially for training and other non-combat uses, such as the disposal of unexploded ordnance, presents major recordkeeping challenges. “While troops check guns in and out of armories, explosives are distributed from ammunition supply points with the presumption they will be detonated,” the report explains. “Although at least two people are supposed to sign consumption reports, it’s an honor system. If explosives are not used and vanish, only the thief might know.” Marines work with blocks of TNT during training., USMC In response to the AP ‘s questions, the Marine Corps said that “lost” explosives are often determined to actually be the result of discrepancies in inventory data that are in turn “attributed to human error, such as miscounts or improper documentation.” The data the Army provided was “a painstaking, manual records review” and “even with that review, researchers couldn’t always determine amounts, so for example it was not possible to know exactly how many pounds of C4/TNT were represented in the 1,066 entries,” according to the story. When presented with documents showing that the Navy had lost track of 24 more grenades than they said, that service’s spokesperson said that information was “beyond the 2-year local records retention requirement” and was unknown to them. All of this only raises more questions about the reliability of the information at hand. The obvious concern is that stolen or otherwise lost explosives and other ordnance could end up being used for a host of malign purposes by terrorists or criminals. However, AP ‘s investigation strongly suggests that stealing these items presents itself as something so easy to do and get away with that people will do so for almost any reason. One individual said they had stolen C4 because of fears that the United States would descend into a failed state if Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and a desire to protect their family. Another person took five feet of Deta Sheet, one brand of relatively thin plastic explosive that comes in rolls, along with fuzes, blasting caps, and even parts of land mine “to have some fun, maybe blow up some tree stumps.” In 2016, federal authorities declined to prosecute a retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel who was found to be in possession of C4, blasting caps, and detonating cord “citing the statute of limitations and the apparent lack of criminal intent.” Members of the US Air Force prepare Deta Sheet explosives as part of a test., USAF The difficulty in ensuring that ordnance and other explosives that are supposed to be expended actually get detonated creates other issues. The AP reported that there have been at least two instances in Mississippi that appear to involve enterprising individuals scouring military training ranges for scrap metal to sell and ending up with dangerous unexploded ordnance. In August, an artillery shell exploded in a recycling yard in that state, killing a worker there. Afterward, another round was discovered at the same site. Local law enforcement suggests that they might have come from a nearby Mississippi Army National Guard facility, Camp Shelby, but officials there told the AP that there is no clear evidence of this. Back in 2012, a man was injured in his home in Gulfport, Mississippi, after attempting to break apart an unexploded round that had been fired from a shoulder-fired AT4 anti-tank weapon . Authorities subsequently said that he had scrounged 51 of these projectiles from a range associated with Camp Shelby. Personnel assigned to the U.S.-led task force fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria prepare to destroy AT4 launchers using C4 explosives., CJTF-OIR All of this feeds back into fears that these explosives could ultimately end up in the wrong hands, including through secondary and tertiary thefts. Authorities only found out about the person who just wanted to “have some fun,” Marine Sergeant Alex Krasovec, after investigating teenagers who had burglarized an abandoned house. Krasovec had hidden a backpack there containing the items he had stolen. That investigation led the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) to Sergeant Travis Glosser, the Marine who had been worried about an impending societal collapse. Both Krasovec and Glosser were demolition trainers at the Marine Corps’ base at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Absent that break-in, there is no indication that anyone would have known about these thefts. “Both Krasovec and Glosser pleaded guilty to theft of military property. Each was sentenced to less than two years of confinement in military prison, and both were knocked down in rank,” according to the AP . “Krasovec was booted from the service with a bad conduct discharge; Glosser is appealing his case.” It remains to be seen what the U.S. military, as a whole, may do going forward to help improve the basic accounting of its stocks of explosives and various ordnance and work toward further reducing theft and other kinds of losses. Members of Congress have been pushing to include provisions in the annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2022 Fiscal Year that would demand the entire Department of Defense adopt new and improved policies for keeping track of weapons and explosive ordnance. What the AP has uncovered already certainly points to a need for better accounting to fully understand the seriousness of the situation.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 25, 2019",T-38 Jets In Recent Fatal Crash Were Executing A Formation Approach: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two T-38 Talon jet trainers that were involved in a fatal accident last month at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas were performing a formation approach at the time, according to a report from the San Antonio Express-News newspaper. The Air Force has also now confirmed to The War Zone that Colonel Nathan Thompson, the second in command of the 47th Flying Training Wing, the main unit at Laughlin, was in one of the jets at the time. T-38 pilots assigned to Air Education and Training Command units, such as the 47th, have been banned from conducting formation landings, a similar maneuver, in virtually all situations in the wake of a different deadly mishap two years ago. The Air Force has released only limited information about this accident, which occurred on Nov. 19, 2021, so far, as can be found in The War Zone ‘s own initial reporting . The San Antonio Express-News reported that the service would not even officially confirm whether or not the jets were taking off or landing at the time of the incident. Images that emerged on social media afterward showed both jets had departed the runway, with one coming to rest upside down. The other was right side up, but had clearly suffered extensive damage, including having most of its nose torn off, as well the loss of parts of its right wing and tail. “Three sources familiar with the incident said Col. Nathan A. Thompson, vice commander of the 47th Flying Training Wing, walked away from the crash,” according to the San Antonio Express-News . “Two of them said the jets were making a risky but permitted maneuver called a formation approach when they went down.” “Regarding confirming specific aspects of the mishap, we will provide additional information after the accident investigation is completed,” Air Force Colonel Todd Vician, a spokesperson for Air Education and Training Command (AETC), told The War Zone when asked about the reported formation approach. A formation approach involves two aircraft flying close together as they head back to base at the end of a mission, but only one aircraft lands at a time. This is different from a formation landing in which both planes touch down almost simultaneously, which is an important distinction. “Formation landings have been prohibited except in emergency situations in Air Education and Training Command since March 5, 2020,” Vician did confirm to The War Zone . “Formation approaches are still conducted.” That prohibition came in the course of the Air Force’s investigation into a mishap involving two T-38s at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma back in 2019. The service announced in May 2020 that it had concluded that the accident, which left two individuals dead, was the result of pilot error. Two T-38s from the 80th Flying Training Wing perform a formation landing at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas in 2014., USAF The pilot error determination notwithstanding, AETC banned future formation landings involving T-38s. In a statement in May 2020 , the family of 2nd Lieutenant Travis Wilkie, one of the pilots who was killed, had said that the maneuver was “dangerous and wholly unnecessary” and offered “no continuing practical benefit to combat pilot proficiency or survivability.” With regards to formation approaches, “a commonly accepted practice is for flight leads to maintain an airspeed slightly faster than the calculated final approach speed until transition to landing,” the Air Force’s publicly released report on the 2019 accident had said. “This reduces the risk the wingman will become dangerously slow while making corrections to maintain formation position.” As already noted, Colonel Vician, the AETC spokesperson, did also tell The War Zone that Colonel Nathan Thompson was involved in this mishap, something that the San Antonio Express-News had reported that it had been unable to confirm. The Air Force, like the rest of the U.S. military, does not typically release the names of individuals involved in mishaps, but who survive, as a matter of policy. As such, the service had previously publicly identified 2nd Lieutenant Anthony Wentz, who died in the accident, but not the other two people who were involved. The third person, reportedly another instructor pilot, who remains in critical condition, has yet to be identified, officially or otherwise. The Air Force’s flight training community , and the T-38 portion of it in particular , has suffered a number of other accidents, many of which have been fatal , in recent years, in general. All of this also comes as the service is in the midst of exploring significant potential changes to its flight training regimens , which could involve less time in the cockpit in favor of simulated training environments , something that has been controversial . Though the Air Force is still investigating last month’s accident, if it does turn out that the two aircraft were conducting a formation approach at the time, it could, if nothing else, put that maneuver under new scrutiny.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2021",The U.S. Wants South Korea To Help Take On The Chinese Military As Well As North Korea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea and the United States are working on a new joint war plan as the two allies seek to keep pace with North Korea’s rapidly developing military capabilities . The new operational planning will also respond to the growing military threat presented by China , with the aim of increasingly including South Korea within a broader regional posture, as Seoul also looks to its own security challenges beyond the peninsula. Details of the war plan have been announced this week as part of the 53rd U.S.-Republic of Korea Security Consultative Meeting, or SCM, which included today’s meeting between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Suh Wook. In the first such meeting since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, the two officials confirmed they would together look at new ways to deter an increasingly assertive North Korea, amid Pyongyang’s spate of new strategic weapons developments. South Korean Hyunmoo-2 missiles are among the deep strike capabilities that the South Korean-U.S. alliance employs to neutralize threats and aggression against South Korea, the U.S. and other allies., SIPA VIA AP The evolving war plans for the Korean peninsula come against a backdrop of U.S. overtures toward Pyongyang with a view to resuming talks, so far without success. Defense Secretary Austin again stated that diplomacy was the best approach to dealing with North Korea but at the same time the U.S. military is reinforcing its presence in the South by stationing more units there. “This is the right thing to do,” an unnamed senior defense official told Voice of America . “The DPRK has advanced its capabilities,” the official added. “The strategic environment has changed over the past few years.” The same source noted that there is no deadline currently set for completing the updates to the war plans. New military capabilities showcased by North Korea in recent months include tests of a cruise missile , a short-range ballistic missile, a submarine-launched ballistic missile , and a claimed hypersonic glide vehicle . At the same time, South Korea has also been working on advanced military development as well, and their ability to contribute new capabilities to the overall plan is considered an important part of the update. The Pentagon had previously announced its intention to permanently base a U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter squadron and artillery division headquarters in South Korea, while troop numbers in the country will remain stable at around 28,500. This is despite the latest defense authorization bill having removed a lower limit clause on numbers of U.S. troops on the peninsula, which had led some to predict the figure may come down. A U.S. Army AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter prepares to take off from Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, after rearming and topping off on fuel, June 2013., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Tong Duong The United States has reinforced its commitment to providing extended deterrence to South Korea, including nuclear and conventional weapons as well as missile defense capabilities . However, with an upcoming review of nuclear weapons policy, it’s possible that the role of nuclear weapons in a conflict on the peninsula could be subject to change, with reports of the possible introduction of a ‘no first use’ policy in this scenario. At the same time, there has been pressure from some hawkish elements in the United States and South Korea to reinstate U.S. tactical nuclear weapons , or nuclear sharing, in the South as a counterweight to the North’s nuclear program. The U.S. and South Korean governments have so far proven resistant to these calls, Washington ruling out the idea in September. Kim Jong Un inspects what was supposed to be a miniaturized nuclear weapon., IMAGE CREDIT- NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA In terms of U.S.-South Korea cooperation, the two countries have agreed to update the Strategic Planning Guidance underpinning their strategy for a potential conflict on the peninsula. This was last done in 2010 when the primary threat posed by Pyongyang was its artillery and other conventional weapons. At the same time, the combined military command is being reviewed, heralding a potentially highly significant change for South Korea. Currently, during wartime, South Korean troops would fall under U.S. command, but Seoul has been increasingly pushing for operational control (OPCON) of its own forces. An M1 Abrams tank driver from 3rd Infantry Division’s 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, on the right, and a South Korean private, a KATUSA or Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army, perform maintenance on a tank after an exercise at the Dagmar North Training Area, South Korea, June 2018., U.S. Army/Sean Kimmons South Korean President Moon Jae-in had previously stated the goal of achieving OPCON before he leaves office next year, but this three-stage program has been postponed due to both the COVID pandemic and North Korean missile developments. However, the topic of OPCON transfer feasibility will be reviewed again in 2022, with a view to declaring this concept fully operational sometime in the middle of this decade. As well as pointing to the need for a revised military strategy to address North Korea’s capabilities, the joint statement from the two defense chiefs identified “the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” a reference to the body of water between Taiwan and mainland China in which the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been notably active in recent months .

U.S. President Joe Biden listens as South Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks during a joint news conference in the White House in Washington on May 27, 2021., AP Photo/Alex Brandon This is in line with the Pentagon’s Global Posture Review that makes the case for working alongside allies and partners to deter potential “military aggression from China and threats from North Korea” as part of a focus on the Asia Pacific region. Indeed, it’s been confirmed that the Pentagon consulted with South Korea as it drew up the still-classified review. Under the revised posture, South Korea will be expected to contribute to efforts to ensure security and stability across the region as a bulwark against perceived Chinese aggression and its extensive maritime claims. This also tallies with certain developments within Seoul’s military, including plans to field true aircraft carriers , in addition to amphibious assault ships , and the recent establishment of a rotary-wing aircraft group within the ROK Marine Corps, or ROKMC, as that service develops its amphibious capabilities. South Korean Marines during a training exercise., ROK MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE “We see [South Korea] now as a net provider of security not just on the peninsula but across the region,” the unnamed senior defense official told Voice of America . This means the two countries will be “looking at ways where we can coordinate our defense cooperation in the region, and specifically capacity building throughout the region.” “The ROK-U.S. alliance is evolving,” South Korean Minister of Defense Suh Wook said. “The strength of such a great alliance will backstop the efforts towards denuclearization of and establishment of permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and also contribute to a stable security environment in northeast Asia.” F-16s from the U.S. Air Force and from the Republic of Korea Air Force, demonstrate an “Elephant Walk” as they taxi down a runway during an exercise at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, March 2012., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Brittany Y. Auld In fact, the kinds of high-end but relatively small and highly mobile forces typically fielded by South Korea could lend themselves particularly well to the new types of U.S. warfighting doctrine being prepared for a potential future conflict in the Asia Pacific. In particular, the U.S. Marine Corps recently unveiled its “ stand-in forces ” concept that envisages small forces that would respond to Chinese “gray zone” aggression, actions that fall below the threshold of all-out combat but which could encompass a range of activities, including cyberattacks , assassinations, or occupation by unofficial militias. U.S. Marine Corps, Republic of Korea Marines Corps, New Zealand Army, and Australian Army conduct amphibious assault training at Doksukri Beach, South Korea, March 12, 2016, during Exercise Ssang Yong 16., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Briauna Birl The U.S. Marine Corps describes “stand-in forces” as “low signature, mobile, relatively simple to maintain and sustain forces designed to operate across the competition continuum within a contested area as the leading edge of a maritime defense-in-depth in order to intentionally disrupt the plans of a potential or actual adversary.” The South Korean military is already very familiar with some of the kinds of “gray zone” tactics that might be deployed by China while remaining just below the level of a full-scale conflict. For its part, Seoul has long faced the threat of North Korea’s huge special operations component that would be expected to perform unconventional warfare, including being inserted covertly into South Korean territory by An-2 biplane transports , miniature submarines and other covert watercraft, and other means. North Korean paratroopers jump from An-2 biplane transports during an exercise., NORTH KOREA STATE MEDIA The U.S.-South Korean statement on China comes in the same week that Suh Hoon, director of South Korea’s National Security Office, visits China to discuss regional issues. This reflects the difficult balancing act that Seoul has traditionally played as it seeks to continue a working diplomatic relationship with Beijing while cooperating closely with the United States on defense matters. It also remains to be seen how Beijing responds to this new South Korean posture and whether it seeks to engage with Seoul. However, the signs from today’s meeting of defense ministers, as well as the wider ramifications of the SCM, clearly point to an ambition to have South Korea play a much-expanded military role not only to face off the threat from the North but to support U.S. policy across the wider Asia Pacific.

Kevin Noonan,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",An S-3 Viking Once Flew A Captured Terrorist On A Record-Breaking Flight To The United States,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In every field of endeavor, there are always legendary individuals who captivate that innate part of us in need of the heroic. In military aviation, it is almost always the fighter and attack pilots who are the headline-grabbers, the origin and focus of the stories we love to hear. The personal exploits and missions flown by fighter pilots such as Robin Olds, “Butch” O’Hare, John Glenn, “Gabby” Gabreski, and “Pappy” Boyington, serve to remind us that the mystery and seduction of flight can be harnessed, but only by a seeming few. It is extremely rare, then, that an S-3 Viking pilot — Commander Philip Voss — and the mission he flew would garner an Associated Press (AP) headline like this one: Transatlantic Escort of Terrorist an Aviation Feat Capt. Phillip Voss, U.S. Navy, from his contribution to the National POW/MIA Memorial’s Conversation Series. , National POW/MIA Memorial The January 28, 1988, AP story brought to the public’s attention an FBI operation that had been conducted three months before in the waters of the eastern Mediterranean — Operation Goldenrod . Fawaz Younis boarded a sailing yacht anchored in international waters with “Joseph,” a drug dealer with whom he had partied the night before on the island of Crete. Younis had been identified as one of the five terrorists who hijacked Royal Jordanian Airlines Flight 402 at Beirut International Airport in 1985. Unsuccessful at getting the aircraft to Tunisia, the Boeing 727 ended up returning to Beirut, where the terrorists let the hostages go, but placed explosive charges and destroyed the aircraft. Looking for a new career in the international illegal drug trade, Younis arrived on the yacht’s deck only to discover that Joseph was an FBI agent. Younis was arrested and quickly transferred to the Kilauea class ammunition ship USS Butte (AE-27) . USS Butte (foreground) doing an underway replenishment with the battleship USS Iowa in 1984. The Butte held Fawaz Younis after his capture until his transfer to the USS Saratoga and Commander Philip Voss’s S-3 Viking., National Archives The Skipper Of VS-30 Just prior to the capture of the terrorist, Commander Philip Voss’s tour as the commanding officer of Air Anti-submarine Squadron Thirty (VS-30) , known as the Diamond Cutters, was coming to an end. The squadron of 10 S-3A Vikings was deployed aboard the USS Saratoga (CV-60) during its 1987 Mediterranean cruise. Instead of heading back to the United States for his next assignment, however, Voss was called into the office of the air wing commander (CAG), where he was told to pick some of his best pilots to fly a highly classified mission. During an interview conducted by Lyn Corley as part of The Conversation Series for the POW/MIA Memorial, Voss described the mission, including a curious question the CAG asked him: “How far has the S-3 ever flown in history?” Voss was about to accomplish a feat that no other airplane flying from an aircraft carrier had achieved. In the Viking community , Philip Voss was already a legend. As a new naval aviator back in the early 1970s, he established himself as an outstanding pilot, flying the S-2 Tracker with the VS-31 Top Cats. After transitioning to the S-3A Viking, he confidently rose through the ranks and was chosen to attend the Naval War College in 1979, a rare appointment for a lieutenant. He then completed a tour with the anti-submarine test and evaluation squadron, VX-1, where he gained extensive knowledge of the Viking aircraft. An S-3A Viking from VS-30 about to land on board the USS Saratoga (CV-30) in 1986., National Archives As one of the strongest advocates for the S-3 at a time when the aircraft’s mission reliability was undergoing increasing scrutiny , Voss wrote a persuasive argument for arming the Viking with the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile in 1980. After a department head tour with the VS-22 Checkmates, this no-nonsense leader was selected for an 18-month tour as executive officer and then another 18 months as commanding officer of VS-30, during which he reached more than 3,000 hours flying the S-3. The Mission Clearly, the Navy thought the best choice to fly this mysterious mission was Commander Voss, as the 1988 AP article explains: After his entire squadron practiced refueling from Air Force tankers for days, he nominated several of his senior aviators for the yet-secret mission, only to be ordered to make the flight himself because of his overriding experience, he said. He added that he had to fly the plane without a co-pilot or navigator over his objections, to make room for a doctor and the government agents . That’s right. He would be the only soul aboard the four-ejection-seat antisubmarine warfare aircraft who knew how to start the engines, power-up the electronic systems, launch from an aircraft carrier , land again in an emergency, and navigate the aircraft from the western Mediterranean to a base on the East Coast of the United States. Keep in mind, the S-3 Viking had an unrefueled endurance between six and seven hours. Six or seven hours would have been a very long time in a relatively small aircraft with four crewmembers sitting on increasingly uncomfortable, almost cushion-less seats as each hour passed, never mind the long haul to the United States. The crew rarely got up out of those seats, and most flights from the aircraft carrier lasted two to four hours. S-3A Vikings from VS-30 in 1981, when the squadron was serving on board USS Forrestal ., U.S. Navy via Wikimedia Perhaps the most important question was: Where, in that relatively small aircraft crammed with electronics, would the accused terrorist sit? It appeared the only option was to sedate Mr. Younis for the long trip, placing him in a Stokes litter “clamshell” (a design suggested by Voss) that would be securely strapped to the interior racks of the avionics tunnel located behind the rear seats. The flight surgeon would monitor his “patient” and spend most of the flight in the co-pilot seat. The two FBI agents, sitting in the tactical coordinator and sensor operator seats, would ensure the potentially unruly passenger remained “seated” at all times. After the four-day journey from the eastern Mediterranean aboard the Butte , Younis was transferred to the Saratoga , where he was placed aboard the Diamond Cutter aircraft. Then, Voss and his “crew” entered the aircraft. With two other S-3s standing by as spares in case the mission aircraft had some type of issue, the Viking was launched, and Voss immediately joined up with a KA-6D Intruder tanker to ensure his air-refueling probe worked properly. He then topped off his fuel tanks. Voss described how a KC-10 Extender tanker from Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina had flown out the day before and was now orbiting overhead the aircraft carrier. After separating from the Intruder, Voss joined on the wing of the KC-10, and the journey began. A U.S Air Force KC-10 Extender with the 76th Air Refueling Squadron, 514th Air Mobility Wing, is refueled by a KC-10 crewed by Reserve Citizen Airmen with the 78th Air Refueling Squadron, 514th Air Mobility Wing, over the Atlantic Ocean, Feb. 14, 2018., U.S. Air Force / Master Sgt. Mark C. Olsen Voss, his unusual crew, and their remarkable S-3 would refuel three times from the KC-10 as the two aircraft navigated over the Gibraltar Strait, then across the Atlantic Ocean, passing off the Azores then crossing to Nova Scotia. Another KC-10 from Seymour-Jonson joined them mid-way to refuel the mission tanker, ensuring everyone had enough fuel to complete the historic journey. As the tanker and the Viking made their way down the Atlantic coast, Voss explained to Corley that flight controllers were having a hard time with a KC-10 that had filed a single-aircraft flight plan from Seymour-Johnson for a round trip to the Mediterranean and was now coming back on the final leg of the flight “with a wingman,” dropping that wingman off, and ending its mission in North Carolina. The KC-10 mission commander asked Voss what his response should be. The tired S-3 pilot told him: “You figure it out.” After a flight that lasted 13 hours and 10 minutes and covered 4,002 miles, a feat never previously accomplished by an aircraft launching from an aircraft carrier, the Viking Rendition mission ended at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. An F-14 from VF-74 lands on the Saratoga in 1985. That year, aircraft from this squadron intercepted an Egypt Air flight that was reportedly carrying some of the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, resulting in an international incident between the United States and Italy. , U.S. Defense Imagery via Wikimedia In his interview with Lyn Corley, Voss explained that, in 1985, F-14 Tomcats from the Saratoga had chased down an Egypt Air plane carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro . But when the Tomcats forced the plane to land in Sigonella, Italy, the Italian authorities were so outraged, they declined to arrest the hijackers and extradite them to the United States. It appears that U.S. authorities did not want to risk another extradition confrontation, so they chose not to let Younis come under any European country’s jurisdiction, even just long enough to put him on a government civilian jet. The FBI notes that Fawaz Younis was convicted in U.S. federal court “of conspiracy, aircraft piracy, and hostage-taking. In October 1989, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.” In 2005, after serving 16 years, he was released and deported. You can watch a dramatization of the capture and flight from the TV show the FBI Files here. The segment dealing with the flight begins around minute 46:30: Postscript: A Brush With A Legend Before he retired, then-Captain Voss was one of my wing commanders, serving as Commodore, Sea Control Wing One — Atlantic while I was an instructor with the S-3B training squadron at NAS Cecil Field. Though I had run across him a few times, I had never personally interacted with him. However, one fateful day, I was ordered to give the commodore his annual ejection-seat evaluation lecture. I prepared a detailed, overhead-projector lecture with many slides, complete with a full-size, static ESCAPAC 1E1 ejection seat training device . I was nervous, but excited to present my work to Voss. Proudly dressed in my finest twill summer whites, I began describing for the no-nonsense commander of all the Atlantic Fleet S-3 squadrons how to eject from his disabled aircraft, properly land, and survive if necessary. I was certain that one of my final slides depicting a pilot hanging by his entangled parachute in electrical power lines, shooting his .38-caliber flare gun at a helpful farmer trying to get him down, would have the wing commander falling out of his classroom chair in laughter. After only a few introductory words from my presentation had made their way out of my eager mouth, he forced his more-than-3000-hours-in-the-Viking hand, palm out, toward me, interrupted, and said, “Noonan! Just let me sit in the goddamned seat and pull the goddamned ejection handle, so I can get the hell out of here for a goddamned meeting!” Yes, sir. He was a legend! Kevin Noonan served in the US Navy from 1984–94 as a sensor operator (SENSO), briefly, in the P-3B Orion with VP-94 and for the remainder of his service as a SENSO in the S-3A/B with VS-41, VS-24, and VS-27.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 30, 2022",The Air Force Wants A New Generation Of Affordable Air-To-Ground Munitions With Swappable Warheads,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. Air Force official has outlined their vision of the kinds of air-to-ground weapons that the service will use in the future, with less expensive munitions and “swappable” payloads marking a significant shift away from the specialized munitions commonly used today. When it comes to destroying targets on the ground, the Air Force of the future should rely on a new generation of more versatile weapons for most of such tasks, with a smaller number of high-speed and bunker-busting munitions to take out particular high-priority objectives. Major General Jason R. Armagost, the Director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, at Air Force Global Strike Command, was speaking at a webinar hosted by the AFA Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a video of which you can find here . Airmen prepare two Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or LJDAMs, for loading onto a B-52 from the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Barksdale Air Force Base, Lousiana., Boeing Discussing a Mitchell Policy Paper, Affordable Mass: The Need for a Cost-Effective PGM Mix for Great Power Conflict, written by Mark A. Gunzinger and published online yesterday, Armagost described the Air Force’s aim to shift from what he termed weapons “exquisitely” tailored to fit a particular purpose to “generic weapons with selectable effects.” That goal should be achieved by introducing new kinds of “low-cost, swappable” payloads, allowing the same basic weapon to be adapted for a range of different targets and flight profiles. Advanced submunition payloads would also potentially allow a single weapon to attack multiple targets. “Everything has got to be multi-domain,” Armagost said. “We can’t think in strict terms of, ‘This weapon is designed for this specific target.’ It’s inherently multi-mission, it has to have that flexibility built-in.” Major General Jason R. Armagost, the Director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, Headquarters Air Force Global Strike Command. , U.S. AIR FORCE As well as munitions with swappable payloads, new air-to-ground weapons will likely be made out of lighter materials and should be optimized for either stealth or high speed, according to Armagost. If the Air Force’s plans are realized, aircraft or drones would be expected to fly into battle carrying cheaper weapons that are able to destroy a wider range of targets. Lower costs should also mean larger munitions stockpiles, to help remove the risk of running out of weapons in a full-blown conflict. Even fighting against a low-tech enemy like ISIS, the Air Force began to experience a weapons shortfall . The problem of munitions stockpiles becoming exhausted in scenarios involving a peer or near-peer adversary is one that has concerned Air Force planners for a while. The Mitchell Policy Paper includes the following chart that shows how the Air Force could run out of standoff munitions after a little over a week of high-intensity fighting against a peer aggressor: Mitchell Institute This challenge is compounded by the increasing ability of adversary air defense systems to shoot down individual munitions. That simple equation means that platforms will, in the future, have to carry more munitions for the same number of targets. Modified munitions carriage now allows a single F-15E Strike Eagle to haul up to 15 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) of various types simultaneously., U.S. AIR FORCE The exceptions to this vision of future Air Force munitions would be specialized weapons that are intended for destroying “hardened, deeply-buried” targets like enemy command bunkers, or mobile targets. The latter target set would be dealt with using long-range high-speed missiles, perhaps a reference to the various air-launched hypersonic weapons programs now under development. Bunker-busting weapons are another are of munitions on which the Air Force is already well-focused, including a new 5,000-pound-class weapon, the GBU-72/B, which is now in testing . A 96th Test Wing F-15E Strike Eagle releases a GBU-72/B while cruising over the Eglin Air Force Base range., U.S. Air Force Not mentioned by Armagost were nuclear weapons, development of which also continues, with major programs underway to provide the Air Force with new freefall nuclear bombs and nuclear-armed cruise missiles . However, the promised versatility of “multi-domain” munitions should mean that these make up the bulk of the air-to-ground weapons inventory, suggesting that it might be possible to procure smaller numbers of highly expensive hypersonic weapons, as well as bunker-busters. All this could spell the end of well-established Air Force weapons like the Joint Direct Attack Munition , or JDAM, which has frequently been the go-to choice for precision attacks in recent campaigns . A 500-pound GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or LJDAM, loaded on a U.S. Air Force F-16 at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Christopher Boitz While Gunzinger’s paper argues that the Air Force should have fielded a successor to JDAM “five years ago,” Armagost talked about a “series of ongoing decisions and tradeoffs” to determine when and how to replace it and other precision munitions now in service. Part of that calculation will involve the Air Force’s developing ‘kill chain’ concept, in which a wider array of assets is potentially involved in launching strikes more quickly, at longer range, with greater accuracy, and more survivability. “You don’t want to get into a situation where you’re having to get creative with legacy weapons that don’t really answer the mail in a high-end fight,” Armagost said. As for the technical details or specifications of the new kinds of weapons envisaged, Armagost didn’t provide too many specifics, but he did note that one option might be to add an additional motor to existing munitions. Using a motor that is “additively manufactured” — better known as 3D printed — would be one way of achieving the required long-range, he added. Armagost also outlined the possibility of using a “low observable, lifting-body” type design for a stealthy long-range munition. A lifting-body design is one in which the body, in this case the missile itself, produces lift, rather than relying on wings or other flying surfaces, suggesting a break from traditional “tube-and-fins” designs. He also pointed to developments taking place in multimode seeker technology , which could perhaps see common seekers used across multiple munitions. Open-systems architecture is another factor that Armagost thinks will help achieve these ambitions, including a price tag of $300,000 or less per round. That figure compares with $186,000 for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), also known as Stormbreaker ; $698,150 for an AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles , or JASSM; and $1,358,787 for a Tomahawk cruise missile . A comparison of the average procurement costs of various different munitions, including selected hypersonic weapons, together with their respective ranges., Mitchell Institute These weapons should also be suitable for all types of Air Force platforms, fighters and bombers, fifth-generation and legacy, manned aircraft and drones, and especially long-range assets that may very likely have to respond to a fast-changing list of target locations, and even types of targets. That implies that the weapons would need to have at least some ability to be programmed for specific targets while aboard the aircraft and potentially after they have been launched. The idea of air-launched weapons using some kind of modularity is not entirely new. In the past, the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon , or JSOW, was developed with different modular warheads, with cluster bomb dispenser, submunitions, and unitary options, although only the latter remains in service. More recently, the Stand In Attack Weapon , or SiAW, has leveraged the modular nature of the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range, or AARGM-ER , design, which features a modular payload section. An artist’s conception of the Stand In Attack Weapon, or SiAW, in the weapons bay of an F-35., ORBITAL ATK Meanwhile, the Air Force is exploring a host of low-cost standoff munitions concepts, as well as the Golden Horde swarming munitions concept, which is being similarly driven by concerns about having the best types of munitions for specific targets. An F-16D carrying the specially configured Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDB) used in the Golden Horde trials., 40TH FLIGHT TEST SQUADRON / PUBLIC DOMAIN In a future scenario, the kind of technology outlined by Armagost for air-launched munitions could also become more achievable thanks to the advantages offered by networking weapons. These include the technologies pursued under the Pentagon’s emerging Joint All-Domain Command and Control architecture, or JADC2, which aims to connect sensors from all U.S. military services into a single network . Among the advantages of networked weapons are the ability to be dynamically retargeted , to use offboard sensors for targeting throughout their flight, and even operate in swarms to enhance effectiveness and survivability. Then there is the growing activity relating to air-launched missile-toting drones, like in the LongShot program and the Flying Missile Rail concept. While these envisage an air-to-air combat drone, rather than an air-to-ground solution, they are similarly intended to extend the range of the launch platform and reduce its vulnerability to hostile aircraft or air defenses, among other benefits. An artist’s conception of the DARPA LongShot concept., DARPA According to Armagost, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall is already on board with his ideas and, in response, has agreed to buy fewer legacy weapons and instead invest in the development of new ones that are more flexible and cheaper. Currently, the Air Force is involved in major efforts to field new-generation combat airpower, including an eventual successor to the F-22 air dominance fighter and the new B-21 stealth bomber . At the same time, it’s embarking on programs to provide these aircraft, and others, with hypersonic weapons , a nuclear-tipped cruise missile , and other advanced munitions . Now, it’s also tackling the challenge of how to supersede the JDAM and other less glamorous munitions, increasing air-to-ground effectiveness while ensuring that such weapons are available in the kinds of numbers that would be required in future combat scenarios.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 28, 2022","It’s Official, Canada Has Rejected The F/A-18 Super Hornet As Its Next Fighter","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Canadian government has confirmed reports that the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Block III has been knocked out of its Future Fighter Capability Project that seeks to find a replacement for the existing CF-18 Hornet fleet. This development is the latest twist in an increasingly protracted competition that was launched in its current form in 2017. The Canadian government issued a statement today outlining what it called a “key milestone in the process to replace Canada’s fighter jets,” saying that the two remaining candidates in the competition were the Saab Gripen E and the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II . The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) hopes to eventually receive a total of 88 fighters, with deliveries beginning “as early as 2025.” The RCAF presently has some 75 CF-18A/B+ jets and is planning to add 18 former Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) F/A-18A/B Hornets to that fleet in the near term. An artist’s conception of the Boeing F/A-18E/F in Royal Canadian Air Force service., Boeing “Today, the Government of Canada announced that following evaluation of the proposals submitted, two bidders remain eligible under the Future Fighter Capability Project competitive procurement process,” the statement from Public Services and Procurement Canada reads. There is no official explanation as yet as to why the Super Hornet has disappeared from the running, although the Canadian government’s statement went on to explain that the “proposals were rigorously assessed on elements of capability, cost, and economic benefits. The evaluation also included an assessment of economic impact.” In response to a request for comment from The War Zone , Boeing provided the following statement: “We are disappointed and deeply concerned by Canada’s announcement that the U.S. Government-Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet proposal will not be included in the next phase of Canada’s Future Fighter Capability procurement process. The F/A-18 Super Hornet Block III offers proven capability and interoperability to the U.S. and its allies, as well as brings unmatched capability and lifecycle value to the Royal Canadian Air Force and a robust industrial/economic package that would deliver 250,000 jobs and CAD $61 billion to Canada’s economy [around US$47.6 billion at the current rate of conversion]. We are working with the U.S. and Canadian governments to better understand the decision and looking for the earliest date to request a debrief to then determine our path forward.” The Canadian Press had first reported the elimination of the Super Hornet last week , citing anonymous representatives from the Future Fighter Capability Project, or FFCP. Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 Hornet fighters prepare to refuel with a CC-130 Hercules over Cold Lake, Alberta., Cpl Manuela Berger, 4 Wing Imaging With a strong emphasis on the economic benefits that the FFCP deal will provide to Canada, this would seem the most likely factor behind the omission of the Super Hornet, although we can’t be sure of that at this stage. For its part, Boeing had made much of the industrial offsets that Ottawa’s selection of its jet could bring. As the company reiterated in its statement in response to the Canadian government’s decision, its proposal had been crafted to inject billions into the Canadian economy and provide hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next four decades. Earlier this month, Boeing hosted a media event that further made the financial case for the Super Hornet for Canada. This included a comparison of cost per flight hour for the Super Hornet and the rival F-35A. According to Boeing, the figure for the Super Hornet was approximately $18,000 U.S. Dollars for fiscal year 2020, compared to $33,600 U.S. Dollars for the F-35A. Footage of the first Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Block III delivered to the U.S. Navy: Boeing had long touted that its Super Hornet offering to Canada offered capabilities that would be of particular value to the country, especially for its domestic and foreign air policing missions, including conformal fuel tanks and a podded infrared search and track sensor (IRST) system. The company also stressed how the existing RCAF Hornet infrastructure would be easily translatable to the Super Hornet. Whatever the exact reason or reasons for the Canadian government decision, Boeing’s removal from FFCP comes as a surprise. This is especially true bearing in mind the fact that two other European contenders, the Eurofighter Typhoon , and the Dassault Rafale , both left the competition before it had begun, complaining that the process unfairly favored U.S. companies. With that in mind, it might be expected that the F-35A would now be the favorite to seal the FFCP deal, especially as Canada continues to pay into the F-35 program as an industrial partner. Since 1997, Canadian investment in the Joint Strike Fighter has amounted to $613 million U.S. Dollars. Lockheed Martin In 2010, Canada’s Conservative Party government announced plans to buy 65 F-35As. However, when Canada’s Liberal Party won elections in 2015, incoming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to scrap the deal and recompete the contract. As this new competition has proceeded, issues had emerged that raised questions about the Joint Strike Fighter’s future chances in Canada, which you can read more about here . There had also been plans to purchase a smaller number of Super Hornets as “interim” fighter jets , which collapsed due to a tangential trade dispute between Boeing and the Canadian government. Canada subsequently moved to buy a batch of former Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A/B Hornets , to supplement its existing CF-18s, a decision that has run into its own issues and drawn fierce criticism . As for the Gripen, while it may be an outsider in some ways, Saab has previously secured an order from Brazil on the back of an expansive industrial offsets package that includes local production and significant Brazilian participation in the development of the two-seat Gripen F variant. Nevertheless, the Gripen is altogether a very different proposition to the F-35A stealth fighter, stressing ease of maintenance, low operating costs, and dispersed operations alongside potent radar and beyond-visual-range weaponry . If all goes to plan, Ottawa will now spend the coming weeks further assessing the two remaining bids, which “could involve proceeding to final negotiations with the top-ranked bidder or entering into a competitive dialogue, whereby the two remaining bidders would be provided with an opportunity to improve their proposals,” according to today’s statement. That should be followed by a contract award sometime next year, based on the current timeline. Should the F-35 end up winning in Canada again , there would surely be considerable political fallout and questions to be asked of the Trudeau administration about how it handled the entire process in the interim. Still, with all that’s happened in the process so far, the possibilities of more surprises shouldn’t be ruled out.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 29, 2021",China’s New Carrier-Capable Stealth Fighter’s Canopy Is Its Most Intriguing Feature,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China made global headlines for its military technology advances yet again on October 29, 2021, when it became clear that the long-awaited carrier-capable version of its FC-31 medium-weight stealth fighter had flown. The War Zone was among the first outlets to report this development, as well as give preliminary analysis, which you can read here . Suffice it to say, this revelation was a major one for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). This jet will eventually equip the PLAN’s third aircraft carrier—as well as those that follow—the country’s first indigenous design, which will include catapults and is far along in its construction. Yet the feature on this navalized fighter adaptation of Shenyang Aircraft Corporation’s FC-31—sometimes referred to as the J-35, J-31, and J-21—that is most intriguing is its canopy and cockpit configuration. Here’s why. Prior to the emergence of this latest iteration of the FC-31, the prototype and the refined version that followed it—both land-based aircraft—featured a bubble-like canopy with decent rearward visibility. Now, this new carrier-capable variant features a totally revised canopy and cockpit arrangement that features no rearward visibility. Instead, the upper fuselage blends nearly flush with the rear of the upper canopy. In fact, it is extremely similar to the configuration found on the F-35, and nearly identical to the one on the F-35B. The refined ‘V2’ FC-31 configuration, with its bubble canopy, from which the navalized variant is based. This new carrier-capable version would do away with this feature and replace it with a configuration very similar to the F-35B, Chinese Internet While the FC-31 clearly is ‘influenced,’ at least to some degree, by the F-35, unlike that fighter design, it has no short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) requirement. The inclusion of the STOVL requirement for the F-35B resulted in significant design penalties that will be ‘paid for ‘ by the other two non-STOVL variants throughout their service lives. The chief driver of these issues was the need to accommodate a huge lift-fan motor behind the cockpit of the F-35B that is powered by the main engine via a shaft and clutch system. So, compared to the F-35 program, one of the biggest opportunities with a new medium-weight stealth fighter design like the FC-31 is not being hamstrung by the STOVL requirement. This should result in a more efficient, cheaper, and higher-performance design overall, at least relative to the manufacturing capabilities available to China. As such, it is quite intriguing that China chose to eschew the bubble canopy on its carrier-capable FC-31 derivative, eliminating rearward visibility. While the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System (DAS) helps with situational awareness in regards to threats around the aircraft, not being able to physically look over your shoulder remains a major complaint from F-35 pilots. Of course, like anything else, it is a tradeoff and is offset, at least to some degree, by the aircraft’s other high-tech advantages, as well as the benefits of having the STOVL-capable F-35B in the inventory at all. The navalized FC-31 with its revised canopy configuration., Chinese Internet What’s most interesting is that China has gone with a canopy-cockpit arrangement that is almost identical to the STOVL F-35B, which reduces rearward visibility even more than its F-35A and F-35C counterparts. In fact, when the navalized FC-31 images first appeared my immediate reaction was to ponder if this was somehow a STOVL and CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) common airframe, which makes little sense. It looked like they adopted the F-35B’s arrangement for a lift-fan behind the cockpit. Upon further examination, it is clear this is not the case. Just look at the nose landing gear placement for proof. So, other factors are clearly at play. The navalized FC-31 variant’s canopy-cockpit configuration looks very similar to the F-35B, far more so than that found on the carrier-capable F-35C. , Royal Air Force/Crown Copyright While images of the navalized FC-31 are limited in terms of number and fidelity, this canopy change is likely for one primary reason, as well as the possible result of a couple of other contributing aspects. The biggest factor would be fuel. Maximizing the fuel load of a tactical jet is already a critical design driver, but for a type that is meant to operate at sea, possibly without an alternative landing site available to it (bluewater operations), it becomes an absolute priority. This design change likely reflects this reality, with reward visibility being traded for more fuel stored in an opportune area for it in a twin-intake fighter like this—behind the cockpit in the central area of the fuselage. The fact that stealthy aircraft lose their primary advantage when fitted with drop tanks makes finding more room for internal fuel even more important, as does the fact that this is a thirsty and relatively svelte twin-engine aircraft that has to also accommodate internal weapons bays, making the fight to find room for extra fuel even more critical. A promotional image showing Shenyang’s land-based FC-31 variant with its weapons bay configuration fully visible., aviation-images.com/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Once again, this is all compounded by the carrier operating environment. With this in mind, enlarging the spine area behind the cockpit and eliminating the bubble canopy makes good sense. There are also potential aerodynamic advantages with such a design tweak. The aircraft’s low-observable capabilities might be enhanced by this canopy arrangement. The canopy and the cockpit below it are some of the hardest elements to make low-observable in terms of the radar signature. In addition, a camera system loosely similar to DAS on the F-35 that could also provide missile approach warning along with general situational awareness as to what is going on around the jet could be part of the final navalized FC-31 design. Even a more basic rearward camera and warning system could help overcome this issue. This is in addition to deeper sensor fusion and data connectivity that would be provided in an advanced fighter with the newest avionics like the FC-31. The carrier-capable F-35C still retains a similar canopy to the A model that has a larger aft view., USMC But once again, our analysis is that this was done, possibly with other less blatant tweaks to the design, to maximize the jet’s internal fuel volume for naval operations. It’s also possible that information as to the F-35B’s canopy and cockpit configuration was obtained by China that would support an almost identical configuration to the F-35B. Hopefully, we will see better-resolution photos of this new FC-31 spin-off so we can have a clearer look for other refinements.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2021",FAA Has Questions For U.S. Army About Spectacular Titans Football Game Flyover (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Federal Aviation Administration has been in contact with the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division about a flyover earlier this month at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. Four helicopters — two AH-64 Apaches , a CH-47 Chinook , and a UH-60 Black Hawk — from a unit assigned to that division flew extremely low over the stadium at the start of a football game between the Tennessee Titans and the New Orleans Saints. Though there has been no formal review of the flyover so far, experts and observers have since raised safety concerns about the event. The investigative team at NewsChannel 5 , a CBS-affiliated television in Nashville, first reported on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reaching out to the 101st Airborne Division, which is based at Fort Campbell in neighboring Kentucky, yesterday. The flyover at Nissan Stadium took place on Nov. 14, 2021, and was part of a “Salute to Service” for men and women of the U.S. armed forces that the Titans organization incorporated into that game that day. “The unit that conducted the flyover is in contact with the FAA Nashville,” Army Lieutenant Colonel Kari McEwen, a spokesperson for the 101st, told NewsChannel 5 Investigates . “At this time, there is no scheduled review.” “The FAA is following up with the military about this overflight,” a spokesperson for that agency also told that outlet in a separate statement. The dramatic flyover certainly drew applause from many fans at the game and others who saw the footage, though others expressed reservations. Video of the helicopters flying over the stadium had immediately prompted discussions among us here at The War Zone , as it did elsewhere. Some have floated points of potential concern with the flyover, including the possibility for the helicopters to have struck some part of the stadium as they flew over. A video shot from the cockpit of one of the AH-64s, seen earlier in this piece, which the Tennessee Titans posted online, shows that the helicopter was below the highest point in the stadium as it passed overhead. Some sort of mechanical failure at such low altitude was another concern. A video that NewsChannel 5 Investigates reviewed appeared to show the helicopters passing by a cable. When the outlet asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Titans asserted that this was only an “optical illusion,” which appears to be the case. NewsChannel 5 ‘s segment below includes the clip showing helicopters appearing to pass under a cable. It’s also possible that downwash from the rotors could have kicked up objects and debris in the stadium, posing an issue for bystanders down below. “That flyover was a little [too] close to knocking down the flags and camera,” one fan Tweeted out afterward, highlighting these concerns. FAA regulations require military flyovers to “be accomplished at 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle,” Larry Williams, the retired aviation safety inspector, told NewsChannel 5 Investigates . If civilian aircraft had been involved, “most likely those pilots would have had their licenses suspended or revoked,” he added. That being said, this is a recurring issue for the U.S. military and disciplinary action has been taken against pilots who have flown fixed-wing aircraft low over sporting events in violation of those regulations in the past. However, an official “ Guide to Low-Flying Aircraft ” available on FAA’s website says, “Helicopter operations may be conducted below the minimum altitudes set for fixed-wing aircraft. The reason: They have unique operating characteristics, the most important of which is their ability to execute pinpoint emergency landings during power-out emergencies.” It also says includes the caveat that “helicopters may be operated at less than the minimums prescribed … [in] this section if the operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.” It isn’t clear if any Army regulations applied in this case in addition to the FAA’s directives for rotary-wing flyovers or if any waivers had been secured in advance. Whether or not the FAA or the Army feels that this particular flyover above Nissan Stadium violated any official regulations and warrants some sort of formal review remains to be seen. Update 12/1/2021: In response to follow-up questions from NewsChannel 5 Investigates , FAA responded by saying that “we do not comment on pending investigations.” That makes clear that its response to this flyover has now entered a new stage. Major General Joseph McGee, head of the 101st Airborne Division “has directed [a] preliminary inquiry into this event,” U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Terence Kelley, a spokesperson for the service, separately told Army Times .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 8, 2021",U.S. Satellites Are Being Attacked Every Day According To Space Force General,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Space Force’s General David Thompson, the service’s second in command, said last week that Russia and China are launching “reversible attacks,” such as electronic warfare jamming , temporarily blinding optics with lasers , and cyber attacks, on U.S. satellites “every single day.” He also disclosed that a small Russian satellite used to conduct an on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test back in 2019 had first gotten so close to an American one that there were concerns an actual attack was imminent. Thompson, who is Vice Chief of Space Operations, disclosed these details to The Washington Post ‘s Josh Rogin in an interview on the sidelines of the Halifax International Security Forum , which ran from Nov. 19 to 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada. The forum opened just four days after a Russian anti-satellite weapon test involving a ground-launched interceptor , which destroyed a defunct Soviet-era electronic intelligence satellite and created a cloud of debris that presents a risk to the International Space Station (ISS). That test drew widespread condemnation, including from the U.S. government, and prompted renewed discussion about potential future conflicts in space . U.S. Space Force General David Thompson, Vice Chief of Space Operations, sits in a room at the Pentagon during a remote talk hosted by the Association of Old Crows in January 2021., DOD “The threats are really growing and expanding every single day. And it’s really an evolution of activity that’s been happening for a long time,” Thompson, told Rogin. “We’re really at a point now where there’s a whole host of ways that our space systems can be threatened.” “Right now, Space Force is dealing with what Thompson calls ‘reversible attacks’ on U.S. government satellites (meaning attacks that don’t permanently damage the satellites) ‘every single day,'” according to Rogin. “Both China and Russia are regularly attacking U.S. satellites with non-kinetic means, including lasers, radio frequency jammers, and cyber attacks, he said.” A Defense Intelligence Agency graphic showing a full spectrum of potential attack types in space, ranging from the reversible to the nonreversible., DIA An infographic depicting, broadly, how satellites would be jammed during the uplink and downlink of data., DIA This is not the first time American officials have publicly accused a foreign power of conducting a “reversible attack” on a U.S. satellite. In 2006, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. government’s top satellite intelligence arm, confirmed that a spy satellite had been “illuminated” by a ground-based Chinese laser. “It was a test … It makes us think,” then-NRO Director Donald Kerr said at the time , adding that there had been no impact to the satellite’s intelligence-gathering capabilities in that instance. Thompson’s assertion that these kinds of attacks are occurring with extreme frequency is new. It underscores the rapid development and fielding by Russia and China, among others, of a wide variety of anti-satellite capabilities, something the U.S. military has called increasing attention to in recent years. “The Chinese are actually well ahead [of Russia],” Thompson told Rogin. “They’re fielding operational systems at an incredible rate.” The systems that Russia and China are known to be developing or have already fielded include destructive and non-destructive types that are deployed from Earth, such as ground-based jammers, lasers, or interceptors, as well as small “ killer satellites ” positioned in orbit. A killer satellite able to maneuver close to its target could use various means to try to disable, damage, or even destroy it, such as jammers, directed energy weapons , robotic arms , chemical sprays, and small projectiles . It could even deliberately smash into the other satellite in a kinetic attack. An infographic showing the various ways one satellite might attack another in orbit., DIA In 2019, a small Russian satellite released a projectile in one on-orbit anti-satellite weapon test. Thompson provided new details about this incident in his interview with Rogin, saying Russia’s satellite had first got in very close to a U.S. ‘national security satellite’ and that “the U.S. government didn’t know whether it was attacking or not.” “It maneuvered close, it maneuvered dangerously, it maneuvered threateningly so that they were coming close enough that there was a concern of collision,” Thompson said. “So clearly, the Russians were sending us a message.” In January 2020, another small Russian satellite closely shadowed a U.S. spy satellite, something that also elicited statements of concern from the U.S. government. Beyond the clearly very serious implications of the 2019 incident itself, the Vice Chief of Space Operations’ comments underscore the challenges the U.S. military and the rest of the U.S. government face in deterring hostile actors or actually responding to acts of aggression in space. In recent years, American officials have increasingly pointed to the policy and other problems caused by the extreme secrecy that surrounds U.S. military activities, as well as those conducted by the U.S. Intelligence Community, outside the Earth’s atmosphere. In another prime example of the secrecy issue, when asked, Thompson could not confirm or deny whether any American satellites had actually been damaged in a Russian or Chinese attack. Beyond that, he told Rogin that even if such a thing had occurred, that very fact would be classified. What Space Force’s second in command could say adds new context and weight to a series of often vague comments from various U.S. Air Force officials back in 2019. Space Force was formally established as a separate branch within the Department of the Air Force in December of that year. “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence,” then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson had said at the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium in April 2019. Former Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson., USAF “That capability needs to be one that’s understood by your adversary,” she added. “They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.” “It’s not enough to stand in the ring and take punches,” then-U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said at the same event . “You have to have the will and capability to punch back. “You would have to be careful about what we declassify, but there is much more classified than what needs to be,” Barbara Barrett, who became Secretary of the Air Force in October 2019 after Wilson stepped down, said later that year . “The lack of an understanding really does hurt us in doing things that we need to do in space.” Former Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett during a ceremony unveiling the newly decorated Space Force hallway at the Pentagon in December 2020., USAF “There isn’t a constituency for space even though almost everyone uses space before their first cup of coffee in the morning,” Barrett had added at that time, highlighting the U.S. military’s heavy reliance on a wide variety of space-based capabilities. These include early warning , intelligence-gathering, navigation and weapon guidance, communications and data-sharing, and more. Even reversible attacks against any of this space-based infrastructure could have major impacts on the U.S. military’s ability to effectively conduct combat operations. The U.S. military has been very open about its efforts to develop and field new and improved space-based capabilities, as well as explore new concepts, such as distributed constellations of smaller satellites and ways to rapidly deploy new systems into orbit, to help reduce vulnerabilities to anti-satellite attacks, in general. Details about the U.S. military’s own so-called “counter-space” capabilities , on the other hand, are extremely limited, as its ability to conduct what it has termed “ orbital warfare .” To date, the only publicly acknowledged offensive counter-space weapon it has is a variant of the Counter Communications System (CCS). At present, Space Force operates the Block 10.2 version of the CCS, but a Block 10.3 type is now in development that is reportedly “more modular and scalable,” according to Janes . Official budget documents released last year revealed that the Block 10.3 system is one that had previously only been identified by the nickname Meadowlands. In announcing that L3 Harris Technologies had received a contract worth nearly $120.8 million to upgrade existing Block 10.2 systems on Oct. 22, 2021, the Pentagon did publicly state that they offer “a ground-based, deployable electronic warfare capability to reversibly deny satellite communications, early warning, and propaganda.” That same contracting notice revealed that there are “16 Counter Communications Block 10.2 fielded systems which currently operate at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado; Vandenberg Space Force Base, California; Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida; and classified deployed locations outside the continental U.S.” However, U.S. officials have at least strongly implied that the U.S. military’s offensive counter-space capabilities are not limited to CCS. Trailer-mounted antenna dishes associated with the Counter Communications Systems Block 10.2., L3 Harris Technologies At the end of the day, what this means is that the U.S. government is faced with a serious predicament when it comes to warning off adversaries in space and otherwise protecting critical assets in orbit, including ones the very existence of which are classified . “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, said during a talk in 2016 in what remains one of the most succinct descriptions to date of the core issues at play. “Is jamming an attack? Is a laser an attack? Does it have to be a kinetic hit on a satellite to be an attack?” From what we know now from General Thompson’s comments, it would seem that the U.S. military has decided that reversible attacks do not warrant direct retaliation. At the same time, from what we understand about the veil of secrecy over the U.S. government’s operations in space, classified retaliatory actions may occur regularly. Russia, China, or any other hostile actor could easily be equally disinclined to publicly announce attacks on counter-space capabilities that they don’t admit they possess. “The United States will work with our allies and partners to respond to Russia’s irresponsible act,” U.S. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said after Russia’s anti-satellite weapon test on Nov. 15. “We as you know, don’t telegraph specific measures, but as I said before, we will work with our allies and partners in different ways to make clear that the United States that the international community is not going to tolerate this kind of irresponsible behavior.” ""We as you know, don't telegraph specific measures, but as I said before, we will work with our allies and partners in different ways to make clear that the United States that the international community is not going to tolerate this kind of irresponsible behavior."" — Loren Grush (@lorengrush) November 15, 2021 Regardless, if Russia and China are conducting reversible attacks against U.S. government satellites every day, it certainly shows that the threshold for doing so is low and that those countries view the consequences, whatever they might be, as manageable and very unlikely to lead to an open conflict. That non-destructive attacks have no potential to cause direct human fatalities and the ease with which they could be denied only further lows that bar. All of this also raises questions about what those countries might be doing in space that is directed against smaller nations that have little or no ability to respond directly. That being said, Russia’s recent anti-satellite weapon test has prompted renewed calls for arms control agreements to ban anti-satellite systems, which present threats to military and non-military systems in space. This includes the indirect risks that come from the debris produced by the destruction of satellites in orbit. Vice Chief of Space Operations Thompson’s new comments only reinforces the dangers that the current environment presents, where at least reversible attacks in space have become an everyday occurrence.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 11, 2021",NASA Calls Off Spacewalk As Concerns Over Russian Anti-Satellite Test Debris Continue (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NASA has put on hold a spacewalk from the International Space Station that was planned for today, citing a “debris notification” that could put crew members at risk. While the specific source of this potential hazard has not been disclosed, the decision comes within weeks of a Russian anti-satellite weapon test that created a cloud of shrapnel in low-Earth orbit. NASA officials have previously been extremely critical of the test, including pointing out the particular dangers these fragments could pose to the International Space Station, or ISS, the crew of which has recently been forced to take action to mitigate the threat. The spacewalk was to have been conducted by astronauts Thomas Marshburn and Kayla Barron but has now been postponed indefinitely, according to a NASA statement on Twitter just five hours before the mission was due to begin. We reached out to NASA for more details and to confirm whether the debris in question is from the Russian ASAT test, which we discussed in this previous article . Marshburn and Barron were among the latest four astronauts to arrive at the ISS, having left the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on November 11. They joined two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut already on board. The purpose of their planned spacewalk was to replace a defective antenna, part of the S-band radio communication system, on the ISS, which is orbiting around 250 miles above the Earth. The 20-year-old antenna was no longer able to send signals to Earth, although the ISS is fitted with backup systems. The spacewalk had been expected to last around 6.5 hours and was scheduled to be broadcast live. “Due to the lack of opportunity to properly assess the risk it could pose to the astronauts, teams have decided to delay the Nov. 30 spacewalk until more information is available,” the space agency tweeted. It’s unclear how close to the ISS the debris was detected. NASA has also not confirmed if this debris is a direct result of Russia’s ASAT test, which was occurred on November 15. Dana Weigel, NASA’s Deputy ISS Program Manager, said yesterday that the resulting debris cloud, containing approximately 1,700 larger fragments around the station’s orbit, had dispersed “quite a bit more” since the test, but that some risk remains. NASA has calculated the chances of remaining fragments — which are traveling at around 17,000 miles per hour — puncturing a spacewalkers’ suit is 7 percent higher than it was before the ASAT test. NASA had already previously announced a “slightly elevated” risk due to debris left by the breakup of the Tselina-D satellite, part of a long-defunct Soviet-era electronic intelligence constellation that was targeted by the mysterious ASAT weapon. Video showing a previous test of the Russian A-235 Nudol ballistic missile interceptor, which also has an ASAT role: “It’s unbelievable that the Russian government would do this test and threaten not only international astronauts, but their own cosmonauts that are onboard,” NASA Administrator, Bill Nelson, said at the time about the ASAT test. “I’m outraged by this irresponsible and destabilizing action,” Nelson added. “With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous.” The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, meanwhile also criticized Russia for its “reckless and irresponsible behavior,” adding that it had shown it was “willing to imperil the exploration and use of outer space by all nations.” In a Nov. 15 statement, Blinken noted that the ASAT test, apparently involving a direct-ascent interceptor , had so far generated more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and “will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris.” For its part, Moscow says its ASAT test was successful and that the resultant debris poses no “threat to space activity.” The Russian Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, explained the launch used a “promising” system that “accurately” struck its target, but few other details of the ASAT system have emerged. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, issued a statement that it was monitoring the debris in order to “prevent and counter all possible threats to the safety” of the ISS. The Kremlin has also announced tentative plans for its withdrawal from the ISS , Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov suggesting the country could extricate itself from the program early as 2025 and instead develop its own national space station. The International Space Station configuration as of 2020., NASA However, the debris risk is being taken very seriously within NASA. Indeed, fragments from the ASAT test had been a cause for concern aboard the ISS prior to today. Even before reports of the weapon test began to appear, it was separately reported that personnel on the ISS have been warned about a debris cloud. According to NASA, the seven members crew sought refuge in a docked spacecraft to escape in an emergency , if necessary. Although that precaution proved unnecessary, in the wake of the ASAT test the ISS crew took other actions to help mitigate a possible impact from the debris. This required them to open and close hatches between different labs in the station roughly every 90 minutes when they got close to the fragments. The International Space Station photographed from a Soyuz spacecraft after undocking, in November 2018. , NASA/Roscosmos As well as this recent ASAT test, space junk, in general, remains a major threat to the ISS and other space activities. Among the millions of items of debris, are the remains of a Chinese ASAT test in January 2007 which produced a cloud of more than 3,000 pieces , as well as parts of a non-operational Russian Cosmos satellite that slammed into a satellite belonging to the U.S. Iridium company in 2009. The latter event left nearly 2,000 pieces of debris of 4 inches or more in diameter, and thousands more smaller pieces. Other debris includes disused rocket parts as well as natural hazards, such as meteoroids. While we don’t have confirmation that the pause on the planned spacewalk is a direct result of the Russian ASAT test, it’s clear that U.S. officials and NASA view that incident as a source of potential risk. This highlights the fact that weapons of this kind pose a threat to objects in space not only as offensive weapons but simply through their testing and the considerable amount of debris they can generate. Updated 6:30 PM EST: NASA has now confirmed to The War Zone that the debris that forced today’s spacewalk to be pushed back was not related to the Russian anti-satellite weapon test. The spacewalk has now also been rescheduled for Dec. 2. NASA separately issued a statement regarding the spacewalk, which is as follows: After receiving additional information about a late notification debris event on Monday, NASA determined the orbit of the debris does not pose a risk to a scheduled spacewalk by Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron or to International Space Station operations. Delaying the spacewalk provided an opportunity for NASA to evaluate the risk from the debris notification. The spacewalk to replace a faulty antenna system on the station’s truss structure is now planned for Thursday, Dec. 2.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 30, 2020",Australia Says Farewell To The F/A-18 Legacy Hornet As Its Final Flight Looms (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than three decades, the Royal Australian Air Force has formally bid farewell to its F/A-18A/B fighter jet, often referred to as the Classic Hornet , as it gets ready to withdraw its last examples of the type. The F/A-18A/B was Australia’s premier fighter and its first line of air defense for most of that time, but it has since been complemented by the F/A-18F Super Hornet and will be superseded by the F-35A stealth fighter. The Royal Australian Air Force, or RAAF, today held a ceremony at RAAF Base Williamtown in the country’s southeastern state of New South Wales to mark the upcoming retirement of the Classic Hornet. The event was attended by the Australian Minister of Defence, Peter Dutton, the Chief of the Air Force, Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld, plus various other aviators and industry partners involved in the F/A-18A/B’s impressive tenure Down Under. A Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A flown by Group Captain Jason Easthope, Chief of Staff, Air Combat Group, puts on the final handling display for an RAAF Classic Hornet at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, on November 29., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The jets taking part in the ceremony were from No. 75 Squadron, based at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory state, which will be the final Classic Hornet squadron to make the change to the F-35A. The unit is scheduled to stop flying the Classics before the end of the year and then make the switch to the stealth fighter in 2022. “It is quite fitting that in [the] Air Force’s centenary year we say goodbye to the Classic Hornet, a fighter jet that has been an integral part of Australia’s defense capability for more than three decades,” Air Marshal Hupfeld told attendees at the retirement event. A traditional water salute for the F/A-18A at the end of its display at the Classic Hornet end-of-an-era celebration at RAAF Williamtown, New South Wales, today., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence Group Captain Easthope returns from his display at RAAF Williamtown., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence “As the time of the Classic Hornet draws to a close after nearly 408,000 total flying hours, it’s time to for the transition to the advanced lethality, survivability, and supportability delivered by the F-35A Lightning II,” Hupfeld added. The current Chief of the Air Force has a special connection to the Classic Hornet, having been an F/A-18A/B pilot and also having taught tactics to newly fledged pilots on the type as a Fighter Combat Instructor. The RAAF’s relationship with the first-generation Hornet dates back to October 1981 when the then-new F/A-18A/B was selected over the F-16 to replace the Mirage III as the RAAF’s next-generation tactical fighter, making Australia one of the first export customers for the Hornet. Under a deal worth $2.788 billion, Australia acquired 57 single-seat F/A-18As and 18 two-seat F/A-18Bs, all but two of which were assembled locally by the Government Aircraft Factory at Avalon, south of Melbourne. Between 1985 and 1990, Classic Hornets were delivered to four units: the frontline Nos. 3, 75, and 77 Squadrons, plus No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) that trained aircrew for the type. With the exception of No. 75 Squadron at Tindal, the RAAF Classic Hornet fleet was centered upon RAAF Base Williamtown, north of Sydney. This F/A-18A livery was recently applied to a No. 75 Squadron jet in recognition of the squadron mascot, the Australian magpie. The aircraft will wear the new color scheme ahead of the transition to the F-35A next year., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence When they entered service, the F/A-18A/Bs were fitted with AN/APG-65 radar and armed with AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Under a comprehensive, multi-phase Hornet Upgrade Program (HUG), the jets have been successively retrofitted with new capabilities to match emerging threats in the Asia-Pacific region. Kicking off in 1999, major enhancements under the HUG journey included the replacement of the AN/APG-65 radar with the more capable AN/APG-73 , integration of the MBDA Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile ( ASRAAM ), Boeing Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ), BAE Systems AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver, Elta EL/L-8222 electronic countermeasures pod, Saab BOL countermeasures dispensers, and Link 16 Tactical Data Link. A new targeting pod, the Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-28 Litening pod meanwhile replaced the previous Lockheed Martin AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk pod. Outside of HUG, other new weapons were introduced to the F/A-18A/Bs, including the GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM). A No. 77 Squadron F/A-18A carrying an AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) during operational test and evaluation of the weapon at Woomera Range in South Australia., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence At the same time, the Classic Hornets underwent a structural rework, including the replacement of the fuselage center barrel that was carried out by L-3 MAS at Mirabel in Canada between 2006 and 2010. Despite its long period of service, it was only relatively late in its career that the RAAF Classic Hornet saw combat service. As part of Canberra’s contribution to the campaign in Afghanistan launched after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the jets were deployed to the remote island outpost of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean between November 2001 and May 2002. The Australian jets undertook defensive duties of the base, which served as a hub for U.S. Air Force bombers engaged over Afghanistan. The first time RAAF Classic Hornets were engaged in combat was over Iraq, as part of the U.S.-led invasion of that country. Initially, 14 F/A-18As from No. 75 Squadron were deployed to the Middle East in February 2003 under Operation Falconer, the jets being commanded by Air Marshal Hupfeld. After conducting defensive counter-air and close air support, the RAAF Classic Hornets flew their last missions of this assignment in April 2003. A Classic Hornet pilot adjusts his flying suit assisted by a maintainer prior to their final combat mission in the Middle East under Operation Falconer over Iraq., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence “This was the first operational combat deployment of Australian fighters since the Korean War, and our aviators and aircraft performed above expectations,” Hupfeld recalled. The Classic Hornets were back in action over the Middle East as part of the multinational coalition to defeat Daesh, in what the Australian Defense Force termed Operation Okra. Between 2014 and 2018 the jets — fully upgraded under HUG — undertook 1,937 missions over Iraq and Syria, in the process racking up 14,780 flying hours, and delivering around 1,600 munitions.

While the Super Hornet was acquired primarily as a stopgap between the retirement of the F-111 and the introduction of the F-35A, the F/A-18F will now remain in service long-term. However, the successor for the Classic Hornet is the F-35A, with a total requirement for 72 aircraft, the first of which arrived in Australia in December 2018 . The RAAF Air Combat Group conducted a formation flight off the coast of Newcastle in November 2020, which included four F-35As led by an F/A-18A., Commonwealth of Australia, Department of Defence The latest RAAF F-35A deliveries comprised three jets that arrived at Williamtown on November 18, bringing the in-country total to 44. The Joint Strike Fighters are already in service with Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons, as well as No. 2 OCU, with No. 75 Squadron waiting in the wings. The introduction of the F-35A brings a step change in capabilities for the RAAF but is just one part of a wider modernization drive. This has already added EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, with more electronic warfare aircraft on the horizon. The same strategy will see future fielding of an indigenously produced loyal wingman drone, known as the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), which will supplement and force multiply the modernized manned tactical combat jet fleet. At the same time, Australia is also increasingly embracing the potential offered by hypersonic weapons . Footage from the Australian Hornet Ball 2020, including appearances by both the Classic and Super Hornets: With developments such as these in the background, it’s clear that the F/A-18A/B was reaching the end of its potential in RAAF service. However, the aircraft themselves will still be around for a while longer. Canada has acquired 25 second-hand F/A-18A/Bs from Australia as it seeks to supplement its existing CF-18 Hornets which are due to remain in service until around 2030, when Ottawa hopes to introduce a new fighter type under what’s proving to be a particularly protracted process. The first ex-RAAF F/A-18A/B Hornets for Canada arrive at Cold Lake in 2019: Meanwhile, another batch of 46 ex-RAAF F/A-18A/Bs has been lined up for transfer to Air USA, for use in the contractor adversary air support role in the United States. The current status of those plans, about which The War Zone was among the first to report , is unclear, although we have approached the company for comment. Speaking today, Air Commander Australia, Air Vice-Marshal Joe Iervasi, himself an experienced F/A-18A/B pilot , reflected on the jet’s distinguished period of service: “While I’m sad to see this incredible aircraft end its role as a sentinel of Australian skies, it’s an exciting time for [the] Air Force as we enter our second century with the F-35A delivering combat air power as part of a networked joint force, to assure the ADF’s ability to deter or defeat threats to Australia’s interests.” With the Classic Hornet’s time in RAAF service rapidly coming to an end, the first-generation Hornet community will be further reduced. The U.S. Navy, once the largest operator, ceased carrier operations with the type earlier this year. Meanwhile, Kuwait and Switzerland have selected replacements for their legacy Hornets, with Finland set to make a decision imminently. Spain is also currently mulling options for a successor. As for the U.S. Marine Corps, they have embarked on even more extensive upgrades to continue flying around 100 of these capable jets for another decade. Update, November 30: The Royal Australian Air Force has announced the final operational flights by its F/A-18A/Bs, with the departure of eight jets from RAAF Base Tyndall to RAAF Base Williamtown today. The No. 75 Squadron jets flew to their destination taking in local landmarks around Newcastle, New South Wales, landing at Williamtown for the last time at around 3.30 pm local time.

A Long March 2C was reportedly used in at least two test launches of a new orbital weapon system that the Chinese military is developing., CCTV News “I think the words that we use are important, so that we understand exactly what we’re talking about here,” Saltzman explained. “I hear things like hypersonic missile, and I hear suborbital sometimes.” Hypersonic speed is typically defined as anything above Mach 5. Suborbital refers to objects that may technically reach space, such as more traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), but that do not enter any sort of orbit around the planet. “This is a categorically different system, because a fractional orbit is different than suborbital,” Saltzman continued. “A fractional orbit means it can stay on orbit as long as the user determines and then it de-orbits it as a part of the flight path.” Historically, a fractional orbit has been defined as one in which the vehicle in question reaches orbit, but is brought back to Earth before fully circling the planet . However, the common working definition of so-called Fractional Orbital Bombardment Systems (FOBS), of which China’s system would seem to be a particularly novel example, has often been expanded to include concepts that do complete one or more revolutions. Saltzman is clearly suggesting here that the Chinese system is designed to spend a more protracted period in space. That description is broadly in line with comments from now-retired Air Force General John Hyten, whose last post was as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, earlier this month. “It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, that impacted a target in China,” he had said during an interview with CBS News . Then, on Nov. 21, the Financial Times newspaper, which broke the original news about this orbital system back in October, published a new story saying that during one of two tests earlier this year, the glider released its own projectile. It remains unclear what the object was and why it was released, as The War Zone has previously explored in-depth . The basic idea of a FOBS dates back to the 1960s and the Soviet Union, though other countries, including the United States and China , have explored similar concepts in the intervening decades. The system that the Soviets are known to have developed and deployed to a limited extent during the Cold War involved an ICBM-like missile that would put a more traditional re-entry vehicle containing a nuclear warhead into orbit. That warhead could then be de-orbited in a controlled manner to strike a target. This kind of FOBS offers a number of advantages over a more typical IBCM, such as a depressed flight profile and a capability to hold any target within a strip of geography along the orbit at risk, presenting challenges to an opponent’s early warning networks and their ability to anticipate where and when a strike might occur. Beyond that, the orbital profile means such a weapon could attack from the opposite direction from which the bulk of an enemy’s existing early warning infrastructure might be pointed. From everything that we know so far about China’s system, it uses some kind of hypersonic glider capable of high-speed, largely level, atmospheric flight and that has at some degree of maneuverability, rather than a typical re-entry vehicle. This, at least in principle, would blend the defense-evading benefits of a FOBS with those of a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle . Financial Times ‘ report that the vehicle in this new Chinese system may be able to release projectiles itself, a technically complex capability for anything moving a hypersonic speed, would only present more challenges for a defender. A graphic offering a very rudimentary depiction of the advantages unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, as well as air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles, offer in terms of predictability of flight profile compared to traditional ballistic missiles., GAO At the same time, if this Chinese weapon system is meant to stay in some kind of sustained orbit, even one that is rapidly degrading, that takes it fully around the Earth more than once, it would no longer really be “fractional orbital” in nature. The Soviets had specifically asserted that their FOBS was not designed to complete a full revolution around Earth specifically to get around the provisions of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, to which China is a party and that prohibits the permanent stationing of nuclear weapons in orbit. Beyond that, questions remain about the exact design and capabilities of the hypersonic glide vehicle. Its apparent ability to carry and release payloads has caused renewed speculation that it could be related in some way to a reusable spaceplane. Though The War Zone , among others, debunked an initial claim from the Chinese government that a test of its new orbital weapon system had been confused with one involving a spaceplane, the country is known to be working on a number of different such designs for both military and civilian purposes . Of course, this novel orbital weapon might use a more warhead-like glider that can release multiple independent munitions, or other payloads, such as countermeasures, during its flight. We still really can’t say with any certainty and Saltzman’s remarks do not preclude any particular design. An artist’s conception of a commercial spaceplane design from the state-run China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, or CASC., HAN PENGXIN / CHINA ACADEMY OF LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOG Separately, Lieutenant General Saltzman raised interesting points about how the difficulties in detecting and tracking the flight of such a weapon could also make it hard to quickly attribute it to a particular country. This could, in turn, reduce the amount of time a defender has to spot and then categorize an incoming nuclear strike and then decide how to respond. “A lot of our warning, you know, is based on ballistic missiles because that’s the been the primary threat for so many years,” Saltzman said. “And so it’s incumbent on the Space Force, in my mind, to make sure that we’re developing the capabilities to track these kinds of weapons. Before they’re launched, ideally, but then throughout their lifecycle – either on orbit or in execution of their mission set.” “If we can track we can attribute … I think we can deter,” he added. “[Space Force needs] to make sure that we’re developing those capacities to be able to track and hold accountable nations who are using these kinds of destabilizing weapons.” This is hardly the first time that senior U.S. officials have warned about the potential impacts of not being able to quickly detect and track incoming hypersonic weapons. Saltzman’s remarks on these issues do give additional weight to comments from General Hyten during his CBS News interview in which he warned that this new Chinese development offered an inherent surprise first-strike capability . Whether or not China would actually posture itself to do be able to do this, the deployment of this orbital weapon could have serious negative ramifications if the U.S. government, among others, feels a need to actively prepare for this potentiality. All told, while many key details about this new Chinese weapon system remain murky, the U.S. government’s assessment is clearly that it has a true orbital component and that this is a key contributing factor in its potential to upset the strategic balance of power between the two countries.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 5, 2021",China’s New Y-20U Tanker Joined Dozens Of Other Warplanes Flying Near Taiwan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of China’s new Y-20U aerial refueling tankers was among 27 People’s Liberation Army aircraft to fly into the southwest corner of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, yesterday. Though Chinese military aircraft flying into Taiwan’s ADIZ has become a routine occurrence , the appearance of a tanker variant of the Y-20 airlifter is a significant development. These tankers are set to provide an important boost in China’s ability to conduct longer-range and more sustained military aviation operations, capabilities that would be valuable for any future military intervention against Taiwan , and other missions in the Pacific and beyond. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense says five H-6s, six J-10s, four J-11s, eight J-16s, two KJ-500s, and an electronic warfare variant of the Y-9 all flew into its ADIZ on Nov. 28, 2021, along with the Y-20U. It’s not entirely clear which variant or variants of the H-6 series, a family of aircraft derived from the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger bomber that now includes various missile carrier types , as well as a tanker version, took part in these flights. There are indications that they were H-6K missile carriers . The J-10 is a domestically developed Chinese fighter, while the J-11 and the J-16 are derivatives of the Russian Su-27 Flanker family. The KJ-500 is an airborne early warning and control aircraft based on the Y-9 turboprop. Taiwanese combat jets scrambled in response to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) sorties, while ground-based air defenses were activated and warnings were issued to the approaching planes via radio. These are routine actions that Taiwan’s military takes in response to the appearance of PLA aircraft in the island’s ADIZ. In the past year or so, the PLA has been regularly sending various types of aircraft into this general area southwest of Taiwan, sometimes in large numbers. On Oct. 4, a total of 56 PLA aircraft entered this part of the Taiwanese ADIZ, which, at least so far, remains the largest number of Chinese sorties recorded in a single day during 2021. A prototype of China’s Y-20 airlifter flew for the first time in 2013 and officially began to enter service two years later. Reports began to emerge in 2018 that a tanker variant was under development. The Y-20U features a single refueling pod under each wing, along with one mounted on the left side of the rear fuselage. This configuration is broadly similar to that of the Soviet-era Il-78 Midas , examples of which PLA also operates. The Y-20U is reportedly able to carry around 90 tons of fuel , which is similar to the capacity of the Il-78, as well. The present operational status of the Y-20U and how many of any kind may be in service now are unclear , but the total fleet size likely remains small. This sortie yesterday certainly indicates that the PLA is getting closer to putting the type into more regular use, if it hasn’t already. Whatever the current size of the Y-20U fleet might be, it is likely to steadily grow in the near term. China has already significantly stepped up production of the Y-20 airlifter and has been working to give the design new, more powerful and efficient jet engines . Growing numbers of Y-20Us will significantly increase the PLA’s aerial refueling capabilities. As it stands now, China’s tanker fleet is dominated by variants of the H-6, which can only carry around 30 tons of fuel and have a relatively limited range themselves. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has just three more-capable Il-78s, and difficulties in obtaining more of those aircraft were reportedly among the factors that prompted the development of the Y-20U. A PLAAF HY-6U tanker., Li Pang via Wikimedia A PLAAF Il-78 tanker., Chinese internet “The PLAAF is developing the Y-20U, a new tanker variant of its large Y-20 heavy-lift transport, which will enable the PLAAF to significantly expand its tanker fleet and improve its power projection capabilities,” the U.S. military’s latest review of Chinese military and security developments for Congress, a public version of which was released earlier this month , said. That same report highlighted the significance of the Y-20U in supporting future longer-range aviation operations that might include aerial refuelable variants of the H-6 and KJ-500. As already noted, existing H-6 and KJ-500 types took part in these recent flights into Taiwan’s ADIZ. “The PLAAF is expanding its inventory of refuelable fighters, developing refuelable variants of the H-6 bomber and KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft, and testing a tanker variant of its Y-20 heavy lift transport,” according to the report. “Together, these new aircraft will noticeably expand China’s ability to conduct long-range offensive air operations.” A KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft., Alert5 via Wikimedia The Y-20U’s capabilities could be put to use in a future Chinese military intervention against Taiwan, something authorities in Beijing regularly threaten their counterparts in Taipei with. Taiwanese officials, as well as their American partners, have warned about the increasing potential for such an operation in the next few years. This comes as the current government in Taiwan continues to make moves to more fully decouple itself from the mainland. The government in Beijing views the island as a rogue province and has said repeatedly that it will take all necessary steps to prevent it from declaring full independence. Any Chinese invasion of Taiwan would include a significant aerial component , though the need for aerial refueling might be reduced due to the proximity between the mainland and the island. At the same time, Y-20Us, together with other tankers, could keep certain aircraft in the fight longer, help shorter-legged combat jets operate on the Pacific-facing side of the island, and drag others in from PLA bases further inland. A map showing the ranges of various Chinese missiles in relationship to Taiwan, underscoring how close the island is to the mainland., DOD These could all be significant force multipliers for the PLA. During any such confrontation across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwanese forces would seek to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, which would increase the value of being able to utilize facilities further away from the immediate fighting. Keeping key, lower-density assets, such as J-20 stealth fighters , in the air for longer periods of time would allow them to better act as enablers for less-capable platforms. These same capabilities could be brought to bear during other conflicts along China’s immediate periphery, including disputed border areas with India . At the same time, the Y-20U, like the Y-20 airlifter, represents China’s clear ambitions to be able to project air and other military power much further away from its borders, something it has historically not been able to do. “The PRC [People’s Republic of China] is developing a tanker variant of its Y-20 heavy-lift transport, which will enable the PLAAF to expand its tanker fleet and improve the PLAAF’s ability to operate beyond the First Island Chain from bases in mainland China,” the U.S. military’s recent China report explained. The First Island Chain is a geographic region in the Pacific formed by a boundary made up of various archipelagos just beyond mainland East Asia. The island of Taiwan is part of that line, and this zone includes the strategic Taiwan Strait and the highly disputed South China Sea . The government in Beijing says that both of these bodies of water are its sovereign national territory, claims that virtually the entire international community rejects. A map showing the generally accepted boundaries of the First Island Chain, as well as the Second Island China further out into the Pacific., DOD Chinese H-6Ks recently joined Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers, along with other aircraft from both countries, on a patrol in the northern end of the First Island China. This is not the first time these countries have conducted a joint bomber mission like this, but it did underscore China’s increasing long-range aviation capabilities within this area. Y-20Us could provide the boost in aerial refueling capability necessary to more regularly conduct longer-range aviation operations further out in the Pacific, including during a future major conflict in the region. Just extending the range of missile-carrying aircraft such as the H-6K, which can carry increasing longer-range weapons themselves, would seriously increase the PLA’s ability to hold targets at risk in the Western Pacific. They could also support China’s growing military activities elsewhere in the world . These tankers would be valuable strategic assets, as well, supporting a more robust air leg in a Chinese nuclear triad that includes existing and future types of aircraft, such as the H-20 stealth bomber that is reportedly steadily progressing in its development. The Pentagon declared last year that the PLA already has a “nascent” triad with the introduction of the H-6N , which is capable of carrying air-launched ballistic missiles that could be loaded with nuclear warheads. These aircraft can carry other oversized payloads , including what has appeared to be a missile tipped with a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle . All told, the Y-20U’s appearance in Taiwan’s ADIZ yesterday reflects a significant development for the PLA and one that extends well beyond any potential planning for an intervention on the island.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While we can’t at this point confirm its authenticity, a video has emerged apparently showing the last moments of the British F-35B Lightning stealth jet that crashed while operating from the Royal Navy’s flagship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth . The vessel was underway in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this month. The footage appears to be in line with previous unconfirmed reports that the pilot tried to abort the takeoff but ran out of deck and was forced to eject during the November 17 incident, which is still under investigation. You can read our original coverage of the accident here . You can see the video embedded in the tweet below: The brief video appears to have been captured using a mobile phone from accident footage that was being played back on a computer. A label at the top of the monitor reading Visual Surveillance System suggests this was part of the raw video from the carrier’s own closed-circuit TV system , which would be used in any accident investigation, as well as to monitor regular flight-deck activity. The footage shows the pilot ejecting just as the jet topples over the end of the ‘ski jump’ takeoff ramp, clearly short of power. The pilot’s parachute seems to become snagged on the bow of the carrier, another feature of previous unconfirmed reports. Once again, we don’t have confirmation that this is a genuine video of the incident, but we can say, at least, that it reflects earlier accounts of what is claimed to have happened. According to a report in the Sun newspaper, the F-35B crashed due to an engine failure caused by the ingestion of a “cheap plastic rain cover.” This report suggested the item was likely an intake blocker that had been left on the jet, although it seems at least possible that it originated from another of the jets arranged on deck. According to that same report, citing an unnamed source, sailors on board the carrier “knew almost right away” that something was wrong and subsequently “saw a red cover floating in the sea.” Clearly, covers and engine blanks have to be removed before every flight and personnel will check thoroughly to ensure this is the case. It’s unclear what might have happened in this scenario, but it’s possible one of the covers had come undone and became lodged further down in one of the intakes, out of view of personnel. It should also be remembered that the U.K. Ministry of Defense has not commented directly on the scenario as reported by the Sun , whose anonymous sources “blamed human error and oversight” for the mishap. The fact that F-35Bs continued operations from the carrier, with no apparent grounding order, suggests this may well have been the case. An F-35B prepares to launch from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Crown Copyright So far, the U.K. Ministry of Defence has only confirmed the time and approximate location of the incident and the fact that the jet was lost during “routine flying operations,” with no other aircraft involved. The Sun report mentions that the pilot involved was from the Royal Navy. The eight British F-35Bs embarked on the carrier were from the Royal Air Force’s No. 617 Squadron, the “ Dambusters ,” which is a joint force squadron with a mix of Royal Air Force and Royal Navy personnel. The unit had been embarked alongside 10 F-35Bs from the U.S. Marines Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “ Wake Island Avengers ,” based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona, but these have subsequently departed the vessel as it approaches the end of its deployment. Meanwhile, efforts are apparently still underway to recover the jet, which may well be almost completely intact, judging by the slow speed with which it entered the water. Only hours after the incident, it was reported that the U.K. Ministry of Defence had approached the United States for assistance with salvage equipment located in Spain, closest to the scene of the incident. As we reported previously , retrieving the Lightning from the seafloor will be a top priority, to ensure that neither the jet nor any of its sophisticated components end up in the hands of Russia, or potentially other powers. A U.S. Navy Towed Pinger Locator 25, or TPL-25, which is expected to be used to trace the F-35B’s emergency beacon and pinpoint its position., U.S. Navy Since then, a U.K. government spokesperson has confirmed to USNI News that the U.S. Navy is indeed part of the recovery, dispatching a ship and crew to assist in the “deep salvage mission.” The same report also states that Italy is helping, too. Most important, of course, is the fact that the pilot survived the incident, the cause of which will surely be confirmed before too long by an official investigation. Whatever led to the loss of one of the U.K.’s precious stealth fighters — they have only taken delivery of two dozen — the accident certainly casts a shadow over what was otherwise a very successful maiden operational cruise for HMS Queen Elizabeth and its embarked air wing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 9, 2018",Flurry Of Air Force Transports Head To East Africa As Potential For Ethiopia Evacuation Grows,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Plane spotters using online flight tracking software have noticed an unusual uptick in U.S. Air Force logistics flights, primarily involving C-17A Globemaster III cargo planes , heading from various points in the United States to the East African country of Djibouti in the past few days. This comes amid reports that the U.S. military has started positioning troops in the region for a potential evacuation operation into neighboring Ethiopia, which is embroiled in a civil conflict. An alliance of armed groups in that country is now threatening to march on the capital and overthrow Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed if he does not step down and open a path to a new government. Since Nov. 19, 2021, at least 16 different C-17As, as well as a larger C-5 Galaxy cargo plane , have been tracked flying from multiple U.S. Army bases in the United States – Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, and Fort Stewart in Georgia – to Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. The aircraft have all made their way to East Africa via a number of common intermediate destinations, including Bangor in Maine, Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and Moron Air Base in Spain. Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport shares its runway with Camp Lemonnier , a sprawling U.S. military complex that serves as America’s main operational hub in Africa. It is the primary staging point for missions across East Africa , including counter-terrorism efforts in neighboring Somalia . It also supports American military activities on the Arabian Peninsula, which lies just across the Gulf of Aden, including in Yemen . A satellite image of Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, with the runway that it shares with Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport seen at top, taken in June 2021., Google Earth It is unclear what the purpose or purposes of these recent flights are or what exactly they might be carrying. The last time a surge of activity like this was observed at Camp Lemonnier was between December 2020 and January 2021, when significant numbers of U.S. personnel and aircraft were deployed to the region to support the withdrawal of the majority of American troops from Somalia . While we can’t say with absolute certainty that this is the case, one distinct possibility is that the U.S. military is staging forces in the region now in case of the need to launch an operation into Ethiopia to help U.S. diplomatic and other government personnel, as well as American nationals, evacuate the country if the security situation devolves. Just over a year ago, a civil war erupted in Ethiopia between the country’s central government and authorities in the northern Tigray Region. Friction had been growing in the country since 2018, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power. Abiy is an ethnic Oromo and the first member of that group to hold this post. Ethnic Tigrayans from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) had largely held political sway in Ethiopia since 1991. That year, a rebel coalition, with the TPLF at its forefront, successfully overthrew the Derg military junta that had ruled the country since 1975. Things had come to a head in September 2020, when Prime Minister Abiy said that the Ethiopian government would not respect the results of controversial regional elections in Tigray. Since the fighting broke out, both sides have credibly accused each other of committing atrocities during this latest civil conflict, which has prompted a humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia. Foreign forces have been involved in the war, including the intervention of troops from neighboring Eritrea on the side of the central government. Prime Minister Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In recent months, the TPLF and forces aligned with it have been pushing toward Addis Abba. Earlier this month nine rebel groups, including the TPLF, announced that they had formed an alliance to unseat Abiy and his government. Just today, the Prime Minister reportedly headed to the front lines to directly oversee the counter-offensive. CNN reported yesterday that elements of the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment, an elite special operations unit, had deployed to Djibouti to be in position for a potential evacuation operation. These troops were from the Regiment’s 1st Battalion, which is based at Fort Stewart, one of the locations where C-17As have recently been spotted departing. That same CNN report said that the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Essex and the rest of its Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which are carrying elements of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), have been alerted that they could be called in to help, as well. MEUs operating from ARGs have been utilized on many occasions in the past to rush reinforcements to countries experiencing civil unrest, as well as natural disasters or other humanitarian crises, to bolster security at U.S. diplomatic facilities or help Americans evacuate. The 11th MEU has AV-8B Harrier jump jets, MV-22B Osprey tiltrotors , CH-53E Super Stallion transport helicopters, UH-1Y light armed helicopters, and AH-1Z Viper gunships. These assets, among others available to this amphibious force, would be useful for support evacuation missions to extract Americans caught up in any fighting in land-locked Ethiopia. Having additional elements from the Army forward-deployed in Djbouti would make good sense, too. Though we don’t know what units might have been deployed so far beyond the Rangers—Fort Bragg is the service’s main hub for airborne and special operation units and is the home of the 82nd Airborne Division . Troops from the 82nd form the core of the Immediate Response Force (IRF), an extremely high-readiness task force that is on call to deploy with hours in response to various contingencies. Personnel from the IRF were among those deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year to support the evacuation operations there. Fort Campbell is the main hub for the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , elements of which supported the evacuation mission in Afghanistan. The 160th’s helicopters, with support from Air Force special operations tankers , would provide one way for Army special operators to make their initial movement into areas of Ethiopia that might be experiencing active conflict, where they could then help coordinate follow-on deployments. Those helicopters would also provide an immediate response element once inside the country to help rescue individuals who might be in otherwise hard-to-reach locations, something The War Zone explained in depth in the context of the Afghanistan evacuations. The U.S. military has forces forward-deployed in Djibouti that it could call upon. At least in the past, aircraft forward-deployed to the base on a more regular basis have often included Air Force CV-22B Ospreys and MC-130 special operations tanker-transports . A rotational regional Army contingency response unit, the East Africa Response Force (EARF) is based at Camp Lemonnier and has deployed in response to similar potential crises in the past. Members of the East Africa Response Force (EARF) prepare to depart Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti for Gabon in 2019. This deployment was in response to concerns about civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but these troops ended up being in Gabon during a coup attempt in that country., US Army The U.S. State Department, which would be in charge of any evacuations and would have to request U.S. military support before it could be employed, has already downplayed the likelihood that such an operation is imminent. “There are no plans to fly the U.S. military into Ethiopia to facilitate evacuations or replicate the contingency effort we recently undertook in Afghanistan, which was a unique situation for many reasons,” a senior State Department official told journalists on Monday. “We are always, of course, engaged in contingency planning for hypotheticals, but again, with the airports wide open, there’s no reason for that at all.” Earlier this month, the State Department did order the evacuation of non-essential personnel and dependents from Ethiopia in response to the conflict. It has also advised American nationals to leave the country. “There is some massive progress in trying to get the parties to move from a military confrontation to a negotiating process,” Jeffrey Feltman, Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, told reporters today . “I was encouraged that [Abiy] was willing to talk to me in detail about what a diplomatic process could look like.” US Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman, in front, seen during a trip to Khartoum, Sudan, in May 2021., AP Photo/Marwan Ali “What I worry about is that the military developments on the ground are moving more rapidly than we’ve been able to get the diplomatic process to move,” he also cautioned. “I was trying to tell him [Abiy] what was the cost to Ethiopia’s stability. The cost to the civilians, the dignity of Ethiopia has been damaged by this war. The costs are too high.” Regardless of the State Department’s current position on the crisis, President Joe Biden and his administration are no doubt eager to avoid any potential repeat of the chaos of the Afghanistan mission . The Biden administration continues to face significant domestic criticism for how those evacuations were handled, with nearly 200 American citizens and thousands of permanent U.S. residents still stranded in that country. With all this in mind, it would not necessarily be surprising that the decision has already been made to position a large and capable response force in the region now, even if it never gets the order to deploy into Ethiopia. Of course, there remains the possibility that some or all of these flights to Djibouti could be unrelated to the crisis in Ethiopia. There are certainly multiple other hotspots in East Africa , as well as ongoing U.S. operations in Yemen across the Gulf of Aden. At the same time, it seems much less likely that any of those activities would prompt the surge in sorties that we have seen recently. All told, it remains to be seen whether U.S. military forces will deploy to Ethiopia, but there is strong evidence now that American troops, aircraft, and ships are increasingly in a position to do so, if necessary.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s one of the most intriguing stories in military aviation. Nearly a decade and a half after its official retirement and four decades after it first flew , Lockheed Skunk Works’ F-117 Nighthawk’s story continues on. Based out of the hangars that line the so-called ‘canyons’ at the same high-security and remote airbase where it began its service in the early 1980s , Tonopah Test Range Airport , F-117s are still flown by the ‘Dark Knights’ on adversary support ‘red air’ and test and developmental missions on a regular basis. After years of the Air Force largely keeping mum about its operations, the ‘Black Jet” is even flying openly from other airfields now , as it serves as a stealthy threat for front-line aircrews and air-defense system operators to train against. It’s an incredible way for the iconic jet to spend its golden years. So, celebrate the world’s first stealth combat jet’s amazing legacy and what has become its very active retirement at its equally as enigmatic home with this ‘Tonopah Canyons’ T-shirt we cooked up with the mad-scientist apparel gurus at Blipshift. Blipshift The shirt features our spoof on an elegant retirement community logo — the Air Force could have sent the F-117 to other lesser retirement homes or had them put down permanently altogether, but instead, they gave their beloved Nighthawks the best shot at a fulfilling twilight to their storied lives at Tonopah Canyons. The shirt also includes the control tower as well as the iconic rows of hangars at Tonopah, which make up the lovingly nicknamed ‘canyons.’ These were originally built to house the F-117s — ironically, in retrospect, the program was code-named SENIOR TREND — during its top-secret early operational years. The two rows of four sets of hangars at Tonopah Test Range Airport, referred to as canyons, is where the F-117 fleet existed during its top secret years and where it has since returned to in retirement. Roughly four dozen F-117s remain at Tonopah, the majority of which are packed into hangars with their wings detached. The fleet is slowly being disposed of, but a handful of F-117s could continue to fly for many years to come. , Public Domain/USAF/Google Earth satellite image This is all set against a silhouette of the surrounding desert mountains, with an F-117 triumphantly streaking into the sky, just as the jets continue to do after all these years.

The story of this week’s top shot: “The West Tunnel Blast Door, which weighs 25 tons and serves as an entrance to a former government relocation facility, also know as the bunker, is seen during a media tour at Greenbrier Resort July 14, 2006, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The bunker, codenamed ‘Project Greek Island’ and planned by the Eisenhower administration, was a 112,000 square-foot shelter constructed beneath the Greenbrier Resort’s West Virginia Wing, to serve as a relocation site for members of the U.S. Congress and associated staff in the event of a nuclear attack on the U.S. soil. The facility was built between 1958 and 1961 and was maintained in a state of operational readiness until the government terminated the lease with the resort in 1995. The bunker will be reopened for public tours on August 20 after a two-year-long renovation. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)” Also, kindly remember: Prime Directives!

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 29, 2022",Watch A P-3 Submarine Hunter’s Sonobuoy Dramatically Transform Once In The Water,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sonobuoys are absolutely critical tools in a Navy’s efforts to keep enemy submarines at bay. We see them chucked out of maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters over and over again, but we really haven’t seen how they can transform once in the water. A video that came to our attention via @RealAirPower1 on Twitter, shows exactly that, with one advanced sonobuoy going through a total metamorphosis of shape and structure once at depth. There are a number of types of sonobuoys that do different things, but they all fall primarily into two classes, active and passive. Active send actual acoustic pings through the water looking for the return off of a submarine’s hull, while passive buoys allow for listening for the sounds made by submarines. Active buoys are usually more complex and far more expensive than their passive counterparts. Remember, these are disposable pieces of hardware. You can read all about the difference and how active buoys are becoming more essential than ever in this past feature of ours . Some passive sonobuoys are also quite complex as they can rely on detecting and processing active sonar returns from pings that originate from a different source. This is called a bistatic sonar concept. Such a system is exactly what we are seeing in the video. It appears to be AN/SSQ-101 Air-Deployable Active Recieve (ADAR) sonobuoy, which is a remarkably complex passive sonobuoy. It fits in an A-sized sonobuoy canister like most sonobuoys, but the look of this container is very deceiving. Once it hits the water, the sonobuoy packed inside breaks into sections that drop down further into the water and it ultimately deploys a massive pentagram-shaped hydrophone array consisting of a whopping 40 hydrophones. It takes around 240 seconds, or four minutes, for the entire array to deploy and become fully operational. Once it is, and other active sonar systems are in use, it can provide very accurate location info of a target. Sonobuoytechsystems.com Sonobuoytechsystems.com Here is a bit more about the system from FAS.org : The AN/SSQ-101 Air Deployable Active Receiver (ADAR) sonobuoy is an A-size, expendable, non-repairable sonobuoy. It is an acoustic data receiver capable of in-buoy beamforming and transmission of received real-time acoustic signals back to any monitoring unit(s). The primary mission is to receive active search signals (i.e., long-range echo detection of quiet, slow moving targets). The ADAR does not drive technological breakthroughs, but does use existing hardware and processing technology. The ADAR sonobuoy is an expendable unit capable of receiving UHF downlink commands and sending real-time beamformed acoustic data via a VHF digital uplink to the monitoring unit. The ADAR will be a free-floating acoustic data receiver that will operate in conjunction with an acoustic source. The buoy will also scuttle automatically upon detection of a low voltage state or completion of its six-hour life.The ADAR is expended by all compatible ASW aircraft or OTS by shipboard personnel and operated in conjunction with an independent transmitting acoustic source. The EFS selector is used to select depth (one of three) and the default acoustic beamform band (one of two). Once in the water the acoustic frequency band can be changed, the RF channel can be changed, and the RF can be turned on or off via downlink command function select. Once activated, the sonobuoy receives, beamforms, and transmits real-time acoustic data in the selected frequency band to the monitoring unit. The separately deployed acoustic source will be commanded to “ping,” ensonifying the water and any target present, generating an acoustic “return” that is received and transmitted by the ADAR receiver. Aboard the monitoring unit, the data is processed and displayed (visual and aural), providing the operator a means of determining range, bearing, amplitude and possibly Doppler (coherent acoustic sources only) on submarine targets. The AN/SSQ-101, it’s not only a sonobuoy, it’s a transformer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 28, 2022",Russian Submarines Getting Countermeasures That Jam Sonobuoys Dropped By Enemy Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is reportedly working to equip certain classes of submarines, especially ballistic missile-armed types that form the core of its second-strike nuclear deterrent capabilities, with new expendable electronic warfare jammers. These are primarily meant to help protect the boats from sonobouys by preventing them from transmitting data to maritime patrol aircraft and anti-submarine helicopters flying above. This development comes as the United States, as well as its NATO allies, have been stepping up anti-submarine operations amid a notable uptick in Russian submarine activity. Russian newspaper Izvestia first reported these developments on Mar. 12, 2020. It’s unclear from their story whether the Russian Navy has begun taking delivery of these countermeasures, known as the Burak-M, already, or if they are still in development. Typically, in Russia’s weapon naming conventions, an “M” at the end stands for the Russian word for “modernized,” which could imply that there was an earlier Burak design that may already be in service. Izvestia said that Burak-M functions by floating the surface and then automatically activating its jamming system, which blocks sonobuoys from transmitting information gathered from their onboard acoustic sensors. It’s unclear how submarines launch them in the first place, but the most likely method is via tubes that military submarines have in order to launch other countermeasures, such as acoustic decoys meant to counter homing torpedoes. The report also did not give any approximate range far-reaching the Burak-M’s jamming capabilities might be and whether it might be capable of scrambling other systems beyond sonobouys’ communications and data links. Izvestia did indicate that the system was intended to provide sufficient room to maneuver for the launching submarine so that it could slink away from its pursuers. Even if Burak-M’s capabilities were limited to blocking the ability of these floating sensors to communicate with their launching aircraft and helicopters, it would still be a valuable addition to the overall countermeasures suite available to Russian submarines. Though anti-submarine warfare has evolved considerably since the end of World War II, sonobuoys remain a key tool for maritime patrol aircraft and anti-submarine helicopters. The U.S. Navy’s latest P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes actually lack a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), something that used to be a default for anti-submarine aircraft, in favor of an improved acoustic sensor system that includes sonobuoys. During regular anti-submarine warfare operations, aircraft and helicopters will drop large sonobuoy arrays in order to fix the position of an opposing submarine and monitor its movements, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . During an actual conflict, this might then allow the aircraft or helicopter orbiting above to directly engage the threat, or to feed that information to other assets, including ships and submarines in the area. It is certainly possible for submarines to escape a sonobuoy net, especially nuclear-powered types or diesel-electric boats with advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems, which can remain submerged for weeks or even months at a time. Improved designs with features to reduce their acoustic signature are difficult to detect in the first place. However, none of this completely eliminates the chances of being spotted and Burak-M would offer an additional option for a submarine looking to rapidly disengage from hostile aircraft or helicopters attempting to pin it down. It’s perhaps not surprising then that Izvestia said that the first submarines set to receive Burak-M would be the Russian Navy’s ballistic missile boats, including the new Project 955 Borei and future Project 955A Borei-A classes, as well as the Project 677BDRM Delfin class, also known a the Delta IV class. It is critical to Russia’s nuclear deterrent posture that these submarines remain as hidden as possible while on patrol to ensure their ability to launch nuclear retaliatory strikes, if necessary. The Project 955 Borei class ballistic missile submarine Alexander Nevsky ., Russian Ministry of Defense Project 636.3 Varshavyanka class attack submarines, also known as Improved Kilo class boats , as well as examples of the Project 677 Lada class, of which there is only one built so far, could also receive Burak-M. These are both diesel-electric types. The Project 636.3s notably lack an AIP system, meaning that persistent harassment from sonobuoys could potentially force them to surface, where they would be especially vulnerable, depending on how well charged their batteries are and the state of their oxygen supply during an engagement. One of these submarines caught snorkeling, or even recharging on the surface, could have to quickly dive and try to escape in a limited amount of time before having to resurface again. The Project 636.3 Varshavyanka class attack submarine Krasnodar ., Russian Ministry of Defense Burak-M is also just another example of the growing importance of electronic warfare to military forces around the world , especially in the maritime domain . Russia, in particular, has invested significant resources in developing advanced electronic warfare capabilities , but primarily for land-based applications . The development of this new electronic warfare countermeasure comes as the United States, together with its NATO allies, have significantly stepped up anti-submarine operations in recent years. This has been in response to increased Russian submarine patrols, especially in the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic region . Maritime patrol planes dropping sonobuoys have been a core part of those efforts to monitor Russia’s submarine activities. This is reflected particularly well in U.S. Navy budget requests, the lastest of which , for the 2021 Fiscal Year, asks for nearly $238 million to buy tens of thousands of sonobuoys. The service is also looking to get almost $26.2 million more for sonobuoys in the supplemental Overseas Contingency Operations budget for this upcoming fiscal cycle. A naval aircrewman removes a sonobuoy from a rack inside a P-8A Posiedon., USN This is less money than the Navy received for these air-dropped anti-submarine warfare sensors in the 2020 Fiscal Year budget, but still more than it got in the 2019 Fiscal Year budget. The service expects to continue buying sonobuoys every year at approximately the same rate through at least Fiscal Year 2025. The United States, in particular, does not look like it will be scaling back its anti-submarine activities any time soon. The news about Burak-M may only be the start of more reports of Russia deploying other new countermeasures in response.

Brian O'Rourke and The War Zone staff,"Posted on Nov 17, 2021",The Ultimate Holiday Gift Guide For Military And Aviation Aficionados,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 2021 holiday season is upon us, and it potentially offers something closer to “normal” than 2020’s. But with global supply chains tangled up, there’s no telling what gift-buying is going to look like once the Black Friday feeding frenzy begins. And there’s no word yet from Washington on the FAA special permissions for the jolly fat man in the red suit to fly his annual route — and if he doesn’t get his cholesterol down, he might also need a special issuance for his medical certificate. In other words, choosing — and getting ahold of — the right gift could be more of a challenge even than in 2020. We don’t want you to have to resort to carefully wrapped rolls of toilet paper again (though I admit to being grateful for them last year), which is why we’ve brought back the TWZ holiday gift guide! This year, we are doing it a little differently. We’ve brought in experts, polled our own staff, and even solicited suggestions from you, the readers.

Both these items are ideally priced for stocking stuffers and office gift exchanges. TWZ Now over to Tyler for his picks. Tyler’s Recommendations A tale of two (okay, four) knives I am way too much of a city slicker to carry around a full-sized pocket knife daily, yet at the same time, I find that it is nice to have the option to carry some sort of blade. Like anything else, I find myself gravitating toward the lightest possible options available, while realizing that one knife (or five!) simply won’t do it all. So no, I wouldn’t call myself a knife expert, but I find the industry fascinating. It’s fun seeing what’s new and how different manufacturers are innovating in a space that dates back to pretty much the beginning of civilization. This year, these are the two knives I would absolutely give my top recommendation to, but for very different reasons. In fact, they represent two totally different ways to go about doing something very similar — give their owner about a three-inch blade for whatever may arise. SOG Ultra XR When it comes to everyday carry, minimal weight is everything to me. I really mean it. I am willing to pay more for any significant reduction in weight and bulk. And since I don’t like carrying a normal-sized folder, because it is just more in my pockets and too much knife for my needs, I have found a solution that gives me everything I want while absolutely vanishing in my pocket. This is not a lightweight knife — I consider it the lightweight knife, with only a couple of competitors that come close. The SOG Ultra XR is about as high-speed, low-drag as it can possibly get. This innovative knife weighs in at just over one ounce , yet it sports nearly a three-inch S35VN steel blade. It has no metal liners. Instead, its extremely tough carbon fiber grips work double duty. It also features the XR locking system found on many of SOG’s larger knives, so no skimping where it really matters. Basically, this thing — an amalgam of steel, carbon fiber, and titanium — has absolutely no weight where it doesn’t have to. SOG Ultra XR, SOG Another thing I like is that it doesn’t have studs, and it closes tightly, so it won’t accidentally open if you go ruffling around in your pockets. This is a huge plus for the very-not-a-ninja me, but some really like the ease of one-handed opening that studs provide. If I really need to open it with one hand I can with relative ease, so it’s not like that’s totally out of the question. What you end up with is a huge amount of utility that actually feels more substantial in the hand than it really is, all without any weight or bulk penalty. In fact, you will forget you are even carrying. And, let’s be honest, you are not going to take on a couple of dozen mercenaries in Nakatomi Plaza with your pocket knife. For almost all metropolitan applications, this thing is plenty strong enough. The downside is this featherweight package does not come cheap, at around $125 delivered , and it is not made in the USA, which is unfortunate. Still, it really is the best package of its kind I have found. For those who want the lightest and thinnest possible option with a decent-sized blade, this is it. When I say thin, I mean thin !, Tyler Rogoway That being said, I would also look at the Benchmade Mini Bugout , which is slightly heavier and bulkier. My Benchmade Nakamura Axis 484-1 is an incredible knife, but it is in a different class than we are talking about here in terms of weight, although it is still pretty light. Made in Oregon City, Oregon, all of Benchmade’s stuff is really high quality and generally fantastic. The Mini Bugout costs about the same as the Ultra XR at about $120. Like everything in life, you get what you pay for. Another runner-up would be the Spyderco Dragonfly 2 , which weighs about the same as the SOG Ultra XR, but has a smaller blade and uses a back lock, which I am not really a fan of for this kind of knife. Still, the price — just around half the cost of the alternatives mentioned above — is really attractive. Bottom line: You can’t go wrong with any of these for an ultra-light EDC folder. But for the absolute lightest and thinnest, while packing a nearly three-inch-long blade, the SOG Ultra XR wins the day. It’s available in gray or gold coating . Buck’s Custom Shop 112 Ranger Moving on from the leading-edge technology for EDC cutlery, I want to talk about an absolute classic and one hell of a gift for a loved one or for yourself. It’s something you will only have to buy once because it will long outlive its owner — a Buck 112 Ranger from the company’s Custom Shop . The standard Buck 112 Ranger is a great choice and costs about half that of the full Custom Shop treatment, but you only live once: Treat yourself!, Buck Knives I just thought it would be fun to have a nice Buck knife, so I learned a bit about what they had to offer, beyond what I already knew about their iconic brand. I quickly realized that they offer fully customizable options on some of their banner products — namely, the Buck 110 and its smaller cousin, the Buck 112. Options include blade point and material type, polish, handle material, grip material, finger grooves or no finger grooves, and so on. Then there are the engraving options, which are a must for an heirloom product like this. Another perk of going this route is that the knife is hand-fitted by one of the company’s master knifemakers. What was most stunning about the entire process was just how easy it was to configure my dream Buck Knife and — dare I say it — how comparatively inexpensive it was. The standard Buck 112 Ranger runs about $60. With that, you get the classic wood-and-brass handle and absolute tank-like build quality, with its fat back-locking mechanism. That is an incredible value. While most people probably just want the original, and that is perfectly fine, for around double the price, you can get the Buck 112 your way, just as you dreamed it. This is exactly what I did. I like a bit of flash, so I went with the blue wood inlay with a polished nickel handle and rivets, a polished blade, as well as some engraving. I also chose the tan leather sheath. My Custom Shop Buck 112., Tyler Rogoway What showed up a few weeks later far exceeded my expectations. The knife is absolutely beautiful. The fit and finish could not be any better. This is quite a feat, considering this knife cost less than many production folding knives. It came with info from the person who assembled it, and it felt like an occasion when I opened the box. I really don’t know what else to say. Buck Knives hit it out of the damn park with the Custom Shop online configuration tool, and they did so at a bafflingly affordable price. It’s not cheap, but it puts the option within reach of pretty much everyone, considering this is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase backed by a company that stands behind their products religiously. And man, does it look incredible. Not in a “I can’t ever use this” kind of way, but more in a “I can’t wait to bang this thing around and give it some character” kind of way. So, do yourself a favor, buy a classic Buck folder for someone you care about or treat yourself. Everyone needs a good knife to do basic tasks around the house, at the very least. Why not enjoy an icon while doing it? The basic Buck 112 Ranger you can’t go wrong with. The Custom Shop option is a step up for those who want to have it their way. Final thought: It is funny that the Buck 112 and the Ultra XR both deliver roughly a three-inch blade in a folding knife format but do it totally differently. The Ultra XR is as light and thin as can be, while the 112 Range is massively over-engineered and weighs about five times that of the Ultra XR. With this in mind, maybe it’s best to have the best of both worlds — by buying both! The Future’s So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades When it comes to quality products that can last for years and years of daily abuse while functioning and looking incredible doing it, I cannot recommend Persol sunglasses enough. Simply put, I have never had a pair of shades that are better built or have lasted as long — both structurally and by simply not getting lost. Yes, my friends, I have beat all the odds and am happy to say I have had the same pair of PO2747s for 17 years! Persol Whether you are taking in an airshow, flying to the airshow, or just going for a weekend drive, these are the shades you have been looking for. My Persols have been all over the place with me. I have dropped them. Sat on them. Banged them into things. Flung them off my face. They have survived inside my pocket and center console for years and years. A British WAH-64 Apache once showered them with pebbles even! But what’s most remarkable is that they look and fit exactly like they did when I first tried them on nearly two decades ago! Their polarized crystal lenses in particular look brand new, which is an almost supernatural thing. Unless you are just not down with their awesome classic looks or their weight — these are not super light plastic Oakleys — there are no better sunglasses to buy. I have gone on to also put the PO3048S into my rotation, which are a bit lighter and are not polarized like the Po2747s, but they are equally as awesome and would probably be a bit more to most people’s liking style-wise. Persol Persol also offers some cool patterns and colors, but the brown tortoiseshell is darker than it appears in the photos and really looks great. You cannot go wrong with the classic black either. These are not cheap sunglasses. They are all handmade in Italy, but what you get for the money is in a class by itself. As long as you are not one to easily lose your shades, they are a must-have. My absolute highest recommendation. Skunk Works Celebration James Goodall has another large-format book out and wow, it’s an accomplishment. 75 Years Of The Lockheed Skunk Works takes you through the entire history of the legendary “bleeding-edge” aerospace design group. Every major project is discussed with an incredible selection of images and details. Courtesy of publisher This is really a great piece for anyone’s coffee table or aerospace book collection. It really lays out the Skunk Works’ stunning accomplishments that have spanned the better part of a century brilliantly. It isn’t cheap, but it is a real keepsake book that comes with a wow factor. Courtesy of Publisher This is a home run gift for any aerospace or military aficionado. Time And Space You don’t have to spend thousands of dollars to have a lot of fun enhancing your watch collection. Case in point: Xeric’s Trappist-1 NASA Edition . I came across this awesome timepiece offering from a space website’s little blog about the Kickstarter campaign that was underway for it. Theme watches are really tough to do well — oftentimes, they end up looking really cheesy. But not in this case. The design is really striking, and not in a “I went to Kennedy Space Center and I got this cheap gift shop watch to prove it” kind of way. Xeric I ordered the ISS Edition, as it has a great retro aerospace look while also being totally different than anything else, but it was a hard choice to make. Once I got it, I was really surprised by the quality. I paid something like $235 for it as part of the Kickstarter campaign. In fact, it gets a lot of great attention. People generally love spaceflight, so when they learn it is a NASA-branded watch, they want to know where they can get one. This especially happens in dim places, because the star field and ‘orbiting’ hands really light up bright. The brass tax: This is an awesome gift any space or aviation enthusiast would absolutely love, and it’s something truly different. Xeric Trappist-1 NASA Edition, Xeric They come in so many color configurations, but the movement is the key price difference. Automatic (self-winding) or quartz (battery-powered) are your choices. I went for the quartz, and I have had no issues at all. But yeah, this thing would deliver a huge smile when the wrapping paper gets ripped away. The fact that this isn’t just some generic branded afterthought from a department store makes it so much more special. It is truly a conversation piece as well as a nice quality timepiece. Now back over to Brian to lineup the rest of our picks! Joe’s Recommendations Spicing Things Up What kind of hot sauces you like or don’t can create bitter divisions among the closest of friends. Just navigating what’s out there today can be akin to trying to follow developments in a capsaicin arms race, as people try to breed the hottest peppers. Though only a small company, Crum’s and its line of Damn Good Sauces offer a single stop for whatever level of heat your palette might be looking for, from the Grim sauce made with Carolina Reapers to the extremely mild-but-flavorful Cool Cucumber Jalapeno. Our Executive Editor Joe Trevithick is a personal fan of the Hot Ta Molly sauce, which is more of a flavor enhancer, being so mild you can absolutely drench your favorite foods in it. Crum’s Oh, and you might notice that the artwork on the bottles of Crum’s sauces all features peppers with Green Berets, and that’s entirely on purpose. Owner Chris Crum is a veteran of the U.S. Army Special Forces, and the company makes a donation to the Green Beret Foundation every time you buy some Damn Good Sauce. One Man’s Personal Air Force If you’ve never read W.W. Martin’s So I Bought An Air Force , now is as good a time as any. The book is an absolutely unique autobiographical tale of the author’s very real efforts to purchase a variety of World War II-era aircraft, including P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts, from the government of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza during the 1960s. W.W. Martin At the time, Somoza was looking to bring the Nicaraguan Air Force into the jet age and was therefore trying to offload its older aircraft, many of which were, at best, barely flyable. Martin, then a down-on-his-luck 34-year-old Chicagoan, decided to buy these aircraft and bring them back to the United States to resell them as warbirds on the civilian market. Needless to say, doing so was no easy task. Martin expected the entire endeavor to take six months, but it ultimately kept him occupied for two years. His book offers a very colorful first-hand account of how he made it all happen. A Good Read From Thomas This is Thomas’ top book recommendation for the year and, although this Vietnam War novel has been around a while, it’s well worth revisiting — or picking up for the first time, if it had passed you by. We came back to it this year for our piece on Operation Wandering Soul , the U.S. military’s broadcasting of eerie sounds into the jungle to conjure up the ghosts of local folklore and freak out the enemy. These battlefield spirits become something like the soundtrack to The Sorrow of War: A Novel of North Vietnam . The protagonist, Kien, helps to recover the remains of fallen soldiers once the Americans have departed the country. In the process, he reflects on the brutality of the conflict and the horrors left in its wake, horrors inflicted both on Vietnam and a generation of its people. Anchor Books Author Bao Ninh draws from his own experiences as a teenage soldier, and it’s clear why the book became a firm favorite among veterans in Vietnam and the United States alike. With its unflinching realism — drunkenness, depression, psychological damage — departing from the traditional narrative, the book also bothered the regime in Hanoi. You may have caught Ninh interviewed for Ken Burns’ The Vietnam War TV series, but he apparently never published a novel again. That’s a shame, for sure, but if you’re only going to write one novel, then The Sorrow of War is one hell of a way to go about it. Flying High Contributor Chris “Ox” Harmer is a former U.S. Navy SH/MH-60 Seahawk pilot who somehow managed to spend most of his lengthy career in flying jobs. So when he speaks about aviation, we listen. ASA via Amazon The “whiz wheel” E6B flight computer is a compact slide rule that does a lot more than tell you how to calculate a crab angle (though it does that, too). As a purely analog device, it takes some learning for today’s digital natives, but it requires no batteries, and it will not fail just because somebody is spoofing GPS or you forgot to charge it. Learning to master a slide rule isn’t half as difficult as you might think, and it’s amazing what you’ll learn about flying if you take the time to do so. But, if you really can’t handle the analog tool’s demands that you show your work, digital versions exist, too, like this one from Sporty’s . So much for the mathematical aspect of flying. No matter what the software guys want you to believe, flying an airplane is a visceral and emotional experience. It affects your soul. And few authors capture that as well as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Chris recommends Night Flight , and I have to enthusiastically agree. The 1931 book is a semi-autobiographical novel about the author’s time flying mailplanes in South America in the 1920s.

Gann’s Fate Is the Hunter is Gann’s autobiography of his flying career, which spanned many of the same years as Saint-Exupéry’s. (Avoid the movie, though — the producers paid Gann for the title, but wrote a very different story.) Gann tells of his flying career, begun in biplanes on Long Island, ending as a bush pilot in Alaska. It’s littered with unbelievable — but true! — adventures along the way, in the early days of passenger and mail service and including time as an air transport service pilot in World War II. The stories of comrades lost and sometimes found will affect you as profoundly (if perhaps less poetically) as Night Flight .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 20, 2021",Russian T-80 Tank With Improvised Anti-Drone Armor Reportedly Appears In Crimea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid growing concerns about a potential new large-scale Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory , at least one Russian T-80 tank has apparently been sighted in occupied Crimea with a bizarre-looking ad hoc armor fit. Armor of this type has been increasingly appearing on Russian tanks as of late and appears to be primarily intended to defend them against attacks by loitering munitions and other armed unmanned aircraft . The solution, which is part of a wider trend of improved defenses for Russian tanks, may well have been inspired by the destruction wrought by drone-launched munitions during last year’s conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh , although it may have at least some capacity to decrease the effectiveness of certain top-attack guided missiles, too. The aforementioned cage or screen-like structures added to the turret tops of Russian tanks are crude metal structures, similar to slat armor, that are clearly intended to provide protection against attacks from directly above. Traditionally, of course, protection for tanks has focused on the sides and the front of the hull and turret. While the armor that we see in the video reportedly taken in Crimea is one of the more common designs, there doesn’t seem to be any standardization of this concept yet, suggesting this work is probably being undertaken, at least partly, on an experimental or improvised basis. Some observers have suggested these top-mounted screens are a response to the threat posed by advanced anti-tank guided missiles, or ATGMs, like the Javelin , which attack from above, and which are now in Ukrainian hands . While the primary function is likely to protect against munitions launched by drones and loitering munitions, the metal structures could potentially interfere with an ATGM’s detonation sequence. In the case of Javelin, it could decrease the effectiveness of its tandem warhead, which is specially timed to defeat explosive reactive armor (ERA) . Even if the cage doesn’t outright stop a missile like Javelin consistently, it could reduce its probability of a kill. Javelin is just one threat, there are other less complex ATGMs that these crude installations could possibly provide some protection against, as well. Russian T-72B3 tanks with top-mounted cage armor on turret top and additional ERA “bags” during Southern Military District maneuvers in the summer: Regardless, it would seem Russia is almost certainly taking lessons from the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, when Azeri forces employed Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones armed with MAM-L precision-guided munitions, and other weapons to great effect against Armenian forces. Weapons like the MAM-L, or even smaller mortars and grenades, are unpowered but can have a devastating effect even on heavy armor, especially when employed in significant numbers. Another driver behind the additional self-protection features could be the Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions , also employed in Nagorno-Karabakh. The problem of how to defend ground forces against both loitering munitions and drones launching small munitions is one that is of growing importance right now . From the Russian perspective, it’s noteworthy that, like the Javelin, both the TB2 drone and the MAM-L munition are both now in service with Ukraine . In addition, Ukrainian forces are making increasing use of simpler, smaller drones, including quadcopters, armed with adapted mortar rounds and other explosive payloads to attack Russian-backed forces in the east of the country. In addition to the cage-type protection, other Russian tanks have been seen recently fitted with other types of standoff armor, including metal screens applied around their hulls and mounted on the rear of the turrets. These items are broadly reminiscent of the kinds of structures fitted to Soviet tanks to protect against shaped-charge anti-tank weapons in World War II. Similar types of slat armor have also appeared fairly regularly during the ongoing civil conflicts in Libya and Syria, primarily to thwart side-on attacks from high-explosive anti-tank rounds, especially those fired from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). This type of armor also became a staple of the war in Iraq. As military blogger Petri Mäkelä identifies on his Vantage Point North site, an appearance has also been made by what looks like additional explosive reactive armor, mounted not in the usual box-like segments but instead within small sandbags, in turn, mounted on a lightweight frame around the tank’s skirts. These seem to be used in combination with the aforementioned cages and would provide a further degree of protection against projectiles approaching from the side. A T-72B3 equipped with both the turret-top cage armor and sandbags packed with ERA attached to the skirts., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP More advanced protection for Russian tanks continues to crop up, as well, including active protection systems such as the Shtora, an electro-optical system that disrupts the laser designator and laser rangefinders that help target ATGMs and other projectiles. According to Mäkelä, a “small amount of the latest T-90M and T-72B3 tanks have active protection systems that may be able to defeat most of the anti-tank missiles and slower-moving HEAT [high-explosive anti-tank] shells.” Another such active protection system reportedly involves a thermal emitter that can be mounted on a tank snorkel, providing further distance from the tank itself and apparently serving to decoy or confuse an ATGM seeker. However, while slat armor, ERA, and active protection systems have all been seen before, it’s the turret-top cages that are the most novel. What’s more, the nature of these constructions suggests they have been put together at the unit level, on an extemporized basis, rather than being supplied as a pattern by maintenance units or factories. Some elements have not even been painted. “While crude,” Mäkelä writes, “the system looks reasonably effective.” This all speaks to a rapid effort to field this additional protection, with an eye on drone attacks in particular. The appearance of these cages doesn’t necessarily signify preparations for an imminent military operation but could well be the result of an urgent directive calling for new solutions to counter what’s clearly a growing and asymmetric menace. If successful, then it’s likely we may start to see more standardized patterns of upper screen or cage armor in the future. On the other hand, Ukraine’s fielding of the TB2 and other armed drones, as well as Javelin missiles, does change the balance on Russia’s western borders and, if Moscow were to launch an offensive in the region, then we are likely to see cage armor make a more widespread appearance. A Ukrainian TB2 drone with MAM-series precision-guided munitions under its wing., UKRAINIAN MOD Finally, the proliferation of improvised or enhanced defensive measures on older Russian tanks reflects the slow pace of the country’s armor modernization programs. Most significantly, the new-generation T-14 Armata tank program, which features an unmanned turret, improved passive armor, and active protection systems specifically intended to defeat ATGMs and infantry anti-tank rockets, has been delayed and planned numbers slashed . As for the situation in and around Ukraine, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv today issued a security alert relating to “concerning reports of unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine’s borders and in occupied Crimea.” As we have reported previously, there have been growing fears that Moscow might be gearing up to launch a new, large-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine as early as January. If that does happen, it’s likely that we would see not only new Ukrainian drones and ATGMs in action but also further modifications of Russian armor to try and offset these threats.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 9, 2021",Pentagon Stands Up New Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Group As Congress Pushes For Even More Action,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Late last night, the Pentagon released a memorandum outlining the creation of a new organization focused on the issue of so-called unidentified aerial phenomena , or UAP, more commonly referred to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, and the threats they might pose to national security . This group will replace the existing UAP Task Force within the U.S. Navy and will be focused entirely on encounters in areas designated as Special Use Airspace, or SUA, such as warning areas off America’s East and West Coasts where many reported incidents have occurred in the past. Separately, a number of members of Congress are calling for the U.S. military to take much broader action, including in a proposed amendment to the Senate’s draft of the annual defense policy bill for the 2022 Fiscal Year. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks issued the memorandum, seen below, regarding the establishment of the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG) under the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, or USD(I&S), on Nov. 23, 2021. Though publicly available , the memo is specifically directed to senior Pentagon leadership, commanders of the U.S. military’s combatant commands, and defense agency and field activity directors. The latter category would include intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). A copy was also forwarded to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who oversees the U.S. Intelligence Community. DOD “The AOIMSG will synchronize efforts across the Department and the broader U.S. government to detect, identify and attribute objects of interests in Special Use Airspace (SUA), and to assess and mitigate any associated threats to safety of flight and national security,” according to an accompanying press release . “To provide oversight of the AOIMSG, the Deputy Secretary also directed the USD(I&S) to lead an Airborne Object Identification and Management Executive Council (AOIMEXEC) to be comprised of DoD and Intelligence Community membership, and to offer a venue for U.S. government interagency representation.” Per the Federal Aviation Administration , Special Use Airspace “consists of that airspace wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, or wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both” and includes, but is not limited to, “warning areas, MOAs [temporary military operations areas], alert areas, CFAs [controlled firing areas], and national security areas (NSA).” A significant number of publicly known UAP encounters reported by the U.S. military have taken place in warning areas off the coasts of the contiguous United States . “Incursions by any airborne object into our SUA pose safety of flight and operations security concerns, and may pose national security challenges. DOD takes reports of incursions — by any airborne object, identified or unidentified — very seriously, and investigates each one,” the press release about Hicks’ new memo continues. “This decision is the result of planning efforts and collaboration conducted by OUSD(I&S) and other DoD elements at the direction of Deputy Secretary Hicks, to address the challenges associated with assessing UAP occurring on or near DOD training ranges and installations highlighted in the DNI preliminary assessment report submitted to Congress in June 2021. The report also identified the need to make improvements in processes, policies, technologies, and training to improve our ability to understand UAP.” Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, AP Photo/Andrew Harnik On June 25, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) had released a hotly anticipated public report on just what data the U.S. military and U.S. Intelligence Community had collected on UAPs, what had been done with that data so far, and the potential risks these objects might present to national security, as well as to basic flight safety. That report offered, at best, limited answers to a host of questions, and raised many more, as The War Zone explored in depth at the time. Shortly after that report’s release, Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks issued another memorandum outlining plans to “formalize the mission currently performed by the UAPTF” and otherwise improve the “collection, reporting and analysis” with regards to the UAP issue. Though buried at the end of the document, her new memo makes clear that the plan now is for the new AOIMSG to subsume this existing task force within the Navy’s Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare/Director of Naval Intelligence, or N2/N6. “Effective immediately, the AOIMEXEC, in coordination with the OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense] and DoD component heads will manage the transition of the current UAP Task Force to the AOIMSG,” it says in its last paragraph. The creation of the AOIMSG and the AIOMEXEC are certainly significant new responses on the part of the Pentagon to the matter of UAP incidents. The specific direction for the group to work to attribute these objects, that is to say identifying their origins and operators, is particularly important. There is a very likely possibility that a not insignificant number of the UAPs that U.S. military personnel have encountered so far are being controlled by hostile actors, including potential nation-state adversaries, such as China, something The War Zone has outlined in great detail in the past. At the same time, narrowing the scope of their activities to incidents in SUA can only impose limits on their work. This is in direct contrast to the actions that some members of Congress are trying to push the U.S. military to take through provisions in the forthcoming defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2022 Fiscal Year. One particularly notable amendment was initially put forward by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, on Nov. 4. It has since become commonly referred to as the Gillibrand Amendment. She has since refiled it three times, each with slight changes to the language. The first time, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, also joined as cosponsors. The second time, Senators Roy Blunt and Lindsey Graham, Republicans from Missouri and South Carolina, respectively, added their names, as well. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand., AP Photo/Patrick Semansky Rubio has already been one of, if not the most outspoken advocates for the U.S. government to take more action in response to UAPs due to the national security implications. He was the one who submitted, on behalf of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the report accompanying a draft of the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 that demanded ODNI produce its preliminary UAP review. He has also been pushing to include provisions in the IAA for the 2022 Fiscal Year that would strengthen the UAPTF, which may now be moot given the Pentagon’s decision to shut that office down. Among many things , the Gillibrand Amendment calls for the creation of organizations similar to AOIMSG and AOIMEXEC, but with much broader authority and that would be legally required to conduct more robust investigations into incidents and report their findings to Congress. What the amendment calls the Anomaly Surveillance and Resolution Office (ARSO) would be responsible for “developing procedures to synchronize and standardize the collection, reporting, and analysis of incidents, including adverse physiological effects, regarding unidentified aerial phenomena across the Department and intelligence community.” The individual in charge of it would be able to “propose, as appropriate, the use of any resource, capability, asset, or process of the Department and the intelligence community.” The OSD and ODNI would be required to assign existing entities the task of conducting “field investigations” and to make sure that “the designated organization or organizations have available adequate personnel with requisite expertise, equipment, transportation, and other resources necessary to respond rapidly to incidents or patterns of observations.” ARSO itself would be called on to establish an entire scientific enterprise to “develop and test, as practicable, scientific theories to account for characteristics and performance of unidentified aerial phenomena that exceed the known state of the art in science or technology, including in the areas of propulsion, aerodynamic control, signatures, structures, materials, sensors, countermeasures, weapons, electronics, and power generation, and to provide the foundation for potential future investments to replicate any such advanced characteristics and performance.” The Gillibrand Amendment also gives special attention to UAP encounters over military and civilian facilities and other assets that deal with nuclear weapons and nuclear power, “including strategic nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ships and submarines” and nuclear power plants. All this makes good sense, especially given concerns that UAPs might reflect significant technological advances on the part of adversaries, such as China, as well as just potential threats. The nuclear focus is also not surprising given that Navy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and their aircraft have been at the center of many significant UAP reports in the past. Separately, there has been worrisome drone activity, which may account for many UAP sightings in general , around sensitive nuclear-related infrastructure , including nuclear power plants. The War Zone was first to report on a series of concerning and still-unexplained drone flights near the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona back in 2019, as well as still-unidentified aircraft swarming non-nuclear Navy destroyers off the coast of southern California that same year. The U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Kidd , which was involved in still-unexplained drone encounters off the coast of southern California in 2019., USN “You’re talking about drone technology , you’re talking about balloon technology , you’re talking about other aerial phenomena, and then you’re talking about the unknown,” Gillibrand told Politico in her first interview regarding her amendment last week. “Regardless of where you fall on the question of the unknown, you have to answer the rest of the questions. That’s why this is urgent. That’s why having no oversight or accountability up until now to me is unacceptable.” In addition, Gillibrand’s proposed UAP-related additions to the NDAA are more robust and well-defined than similar language that the House of Representatives has included in its draft of the NDAA. Just today, Representative Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who crafted the House’s UAP provisions, said that her amendment “has more teeth” than his and that he would work with her directly going forward. He added that the new Pentagon UAP group does not obviate the need for additional legislation on the issue. While the House passed its version of the NDAA in September, the Senate has yet to do so with its draft. Afterward, the two chambers will need to work together to reconcile the bills before a final vote. President Joe Biden would still then need to sign it into law for any UAP provisions to come into effect. With the final NDAA language on UAPs still in flux, there has already been criticism about the Pentagon’s new plans for the AOIMSG and AOIMEXEC. There are concerns that the Department’s latest actions are an attempt to offer an alternative to something far more robust and harder to sideline like the Gillibrand Amendment. It is already widely understood that the existing UAPTF has been chronically under-resourced, with allegations that this has been part of a deliberate effort to bury the issue entirely. The Air Force, in particular, has been notoriously averse to publicly acknowledging this topic at all, and even in supporting internal efforts to get to the bottom of it, for instance. It very much remains to be seen what the exact structure and responsibilities of Pentagon entities tasked with responding to the matter of UAPs will be going forward. Still, the Office of the Secretary of Defense is already taking some steps, while Congress continues to push for additional action on what everyone involved seems to increasingly understand to be a significant national security issue.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 16, 2022",Italian Air Force Boss Envisions Merger Of Europe’s Next-Generation Combat Aircraft Programs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The chief of the Italian Air Force has predicted the merger of Western Europe’s two leading next-generation combat aircraft programs since he doesn’t think there are enough resources to sustain them both. The two competing programs are the British-led Tempest , a mock-up of which is seen in the image below, and which involves Italy, and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) pursued by France, Germany, and Spain. “It is natural that these two realities will merge into one,” General Luca Goretti, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Air Force, told members of the country’s parliamentary defense committees today, according to a report from Reuters . “Investing huge financial resources in two equivalent programs is unthinkable.” This is by no means the first time that calls have been made to bring the two initiatives together, even just in Italy , reflecting the limited pool of partners available. A mockup of the Tempest fighter concept., BAE Systems Currently, BAE Systems is heading up the Tempest program, which aims to field a sixth-generation “system of systems” air combat capability, with a new stealthy six-generation fighter as its centerpiece. Team Tempest also includes Italian defense contractor Leonardo , European missile consortium MBDA , British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce , and the British Royal Air Force (RAF), as well as numerous other high-tech companies. Sweden is also on board as an international partner, with Japan potentially waiting in the wings. An infographic outlining the basic goals behind the Tempest program., Leonardo Meanwhile, FCAS is being led by Dassault Aviation of France, with Airbus of Germany in a supporting role. This effort also includes plans for a stealth fighter jet, or Next Generation Fighter (NGF), together with various unmanned systems and air-launched weapons. While the French and Germans are leading the FCAS effort, the Spanish Ministry of Defense has also joined the partnership . Both programs aim to have the manned fighter component of the planned system of systems in service sometime between 2030 and 2040. According to the same Reuters report , Goretti told officials that Italy made the decision to join the Tempest program “because it felt it could play a bigger role [in it] than in the FCAS program.” That could well reflect the perceived dominance of Dassault and Airbus in FCAS, as well as the fact that Leonardo already has strong ties with the United Kingdom on the industrial side, including leading radar development for the Eurofighter Typhoon in its U.K. facility. The Eurofighter consortium also includes BAE Systems and Airbus. The signing of an FCAS contract, in February 2020. Seen left to right are Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, German Minister of Defense, Florence Parly, Minister of the Armed Forces of France, and Angel Olivares Ramírez, Spanish secretary of State for Defense., DASSAULT AVIATION However, Goretti also made the case for Italy serving as “a bridge” between NATO and Western European nations that are increasingly looking toward options for collaboration on the continent, rather than necessarily under the Alliance’s auspices. Goretti’s argument for the eventual fusion of Tempest and FCAS is explained by the fact both are still in their “conceptual phase,” with different countries still defining their requirements. With that in mind, Goretti considers the reverse of the Eurofighter program might be possible — back in the early 1980s, France split off from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain to build the rival Dassault  Rafale instead. A U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II, two French Air Force Rafales, and a Royal Air Force Typhoon fly in formation over France, May 19, 2021. , U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexander Cook Another European air chief, Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz of the German Luftwaffe, previously made efforts to bring the two rival programs together, by speaking with his Italian and British counterparts. “It can be that we go on different tracks,” Gerhartz told Defense News earlier this year . “Hopefully we will merge eventually.” Key industry figures involved with Tempest have been lukewarm on the idea of a merger with FCAS. At the same time, Dirk Hoke, the former CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, had previously argued that Europe “can’t afford two new systems.” Hoke’s statement may well be true, with genuine concerns persisting over whether European powers will actually be able to pay for two competing stealth jet programs. A full-size mockup of the NGF. , JohnNewton8/wikicommons Furthermore, the availability of potential alternative manned fighters throws up more questions about the viability of either one of these European efforts. In advance of these sixth-generation efforts, many European powers have signed deals to buy F-35 in recent years, putting a strain on available budgets and putting at least some of them out of the market for Tempest or FCAS. Within FCAS, the Spanish Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, was recently forced to backtrack on claims that it was not looking at a potential purchase of F-35 stealth jets from the United States, as it seeks to replace a portion of its EF-18 Hornet fleet and its carrier-based EAV-8B Harrier IIs. That denial seemed to be squarely aimed at placating France, as FCAS lead, while Madrid hedged its bets over future fighter equipment. As for the United Kingdom, which aims to buy both Tempest and F-35, cost-saving measures are the order of the day, too, with a likely reduction in Lightning numbers as well as second thoughts about upgrading the same jets . These issues are indicative of the competing cost priorities in the combat air realm and are not limited to the British. Although the competing future combat aircraft programs are indeed in the conceptual phase, certain key differences have already become clear. For example, France needs the NGF to be compatible with operations from aircraft carriers equipped with catapults , as well as the ability to conduct nuclear strike missions as part of its national deterrent. An artist’s conception of the future French Navy carrier design, with navalized NGFs on the deck., NAVAL GROUP At the same time, the rift between London and its counterparts in continental Europe is still considerable, as a result of U.K. government’s decision to leave the European Union, better known as Brexit. Anglo-French relations are now even frostier thanks to the new AUKUS partnership , comprising Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Australia’s controversial decision to scrap its plans to acquire French-designed submarines in favor of new nuclear-powered submarines was a direct result of this agreement. With that in mind, while Goretti’s dream of a combined FCAS/Tempest program would likely offer better prospects of financial success all around, by pooling resources and reducing competition, as well as ensuring that Italy, in particular, doesn’t lose out on any economic benefits, the likelihood of it ever happening is tempered by the realpolitik of intra-European relations. As well as that, there’s the fact that, even at this early stage, FCAS and Tempest are already heading in different directions to meet diverging requirements. As such, Goretti’s dream could possibly remain just that. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces F-35 Fighters"

A report today from Bloomberg cited a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, who confirmed that the Biden administration is still working out whether the VH-92A is safe to be put into operation with Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1). Marine Helicopter Squadron One conducts test flights of the VH-92A helicopter over the South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, D.C., September 22, 2018., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Hunter Helis Bloomberg has also obtained an internal summary from the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) test office, dated September 28, which describes the VH-92A as “failing to meet the reliability, availability or maintainability threshold requirements” required of it. That same summary notes that the helicopter is not considered “operationally suitable” and that this is a particular concern for the continuity of government mission set and other contingency operations. That’s obviously a significant shortcoming in an aircraft that would, for example, be expected to whisk the president to wherever they would be required should something catastrophic ever occur. The full scope of the problems that prevent the VH-92A from reliably executing these critical operations is not clear, although the Bloomberg report does point to shortcomings with the Mission Communication System (MCS). According to the test office’s summary, the MCS “often delayed critical communications at the beginning of contingency missions and did not adequately support timely, continuous and secure communications.” When there was a problem with the MCS, maintainers were not provided with the required diagnostic capability at the squadron level, while it took too long to actually access the components of the system that needed fixing. The MCS issue came up in the most recent Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) report to be published, for Fiscal Year 2020, which stated that the MCS 3.0 version began testing in January 2020. This version “incorporated recommendations from DOT&E’s VH-92A Operational Assessment OT-B1 report, dated May 28, 2019, including the use of MCS test scripts that aided in the discovery of deficiencies during the assessment. The Program Office has been addressing MCS deficiencies, discovered in testing.” Two VH-92As in formation over the capital. , BLEND QATIPI In regards to MCS 3.0, the DOT&E report pointed to the requirement for “design changes in hardware […] particularly intercommunication system cords, to improve the usability of communications equipment at different passenger seats in the aircraft.” The same DOT&E report noted that five iterative releases of MCS 3.1 software had also been tested, while the NAVAIR design team “continues to make improvements,” with MCS 3.2 due to start testing in January 2021. Again, it hardly needs stating that, during a potential crisis, in which the president might need to be transported rapidly for their own safety and potentially that of the country, reliable communications would be paramount to achieve success in a rapidly evolving scenario. Deficiencies with the communications system could possibly impact the president’s ability to connect to the National Command Authority , and this would impact the credibility and usability of America’s nuclear deterrent. Regardless, reliable communications during a crisis are absolutely key to the president retaining command and control when it is needed most. An Air Force officer walks off a Marine One VH-3D with the “football,” the briefcase containing a remote command interface used to order the release of nuclear weapons and connect the President to the National Command Authority. , AP The test summary obtained by Bloomberg further points to “instability, cabin interior flaws, frequent maintenance inspections and rear air-stair door components” combining to slow down the maintenance process and reduce aircraft availability. Legacy issues with the helicopter persist, too. As long ago as September 2018 it was found that the VH-92A’s engine exhaust and rotors could cause damage to the White House South Lawn, where Marine One routinely operates from. The summary of the test report confirms that this problem still hasn’t been fixed, as evidenced by a succession of reports on this topic since it was first discovered. “Engine exhaust and fluid discharge cause landing zone damage limitations, limiting the number of available landing zones,” the summary states, before calling for the Marines to “continue to reduce effects of engine exhaust and fluid discharges.” It’s not clear how this might actually be achieved. The first landing by a VH-92A on the South Lawn of the White House in September 2018., U.S. MARINE CORPS/SGT. HUNTER HELIS With all this in mind, the White House Military Office has not yet approved a first presidential flight with the VH-92A, while it reassesses the timeline for the new helicopter. Previously, it was expected that the VH-92A would begin replacing the iconic VH-3D when it achieved initial operational capability (IOC) in July, which never happened. It was then planned to begin replacing the Black Hawk-based VH-60Ns , a process slated to be completed by 2023, by which time a full fleet of 23 of the new helicopters would be available. IOC had already been pushed back successively from an earlier target of June 2020, and January this year. It’s not all bad news for the VH-92A, however. The same test report confirms that the helicopter is suitable for routine “administrative” missions. These might include a planned shuttle to Camp David or ferrying the president to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington to connect with a preplanned Air Force One flight. A U.S. Marine stands at ease next to a VH-60N helicopter as Air Force One lands at Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado, April 2012, during a visit by President Obama. , U.S. Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Wolfram M. Stumpf While this reflects a degree of “operationally effectiveness,” it’s hardly what Pentagon and White House officials would have hoped for the $5-billion VH-92 program. It’s also unclear why it has taken until now for the details of the delays to become public. Three months of DOT&E testing was already wrapped up in April this year and in early August Marine Corps Major General Greg Masiello, program executive officer for air anti-submarine warfare, assault, and special mission programs at NAVAIR declared that “The squadron and the program are ready today.” Bloomberg approached the test office to determine what happened as a result of the three-month trials period but was told the results constituted “controlled unclassified information.” A test office spokeswoman did say that those tests were intended to assess whether the VH-92A was “effective and suitable to perform transport of the President, Vice President, cabinet members and heads of state.” Meanwhile, spokesman for the Marine aviation deputy commandant told Bloomberg that “The report did not raise any issues” that the program office and Marine Corps “were unaware of, or the issues were previously corrected.” However, the same spokesman could not confirm when then the VH-92A might actually start flying missions with the president on board. A spokesman for Lockheed’s Sikorsky aircraft division, responsible for building the VH-92A, said that the division “continues to work closely with our customer to ensure the aircraft meets all operational requirements.” Currently, therefore, it’s uncertain when the VH-92A will start flying the prestigious Marine One mission. However, with the Navy having placed orders for the full fleet of 23 VH-92As, with $1.5 billion already spent on them, it’s clear that fixes for the various outstanding issues will have to be found if the helicopters are going to fulfill their full mission spectrum. Any further delays are the last thing VMX-1 needs as the requirement to replace the VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns only becomes more urgent.

"Joseph Trevithick, Thomas Newdick, Tyler Rogoway","Updated on Nov 30, 2021",China’s Hypersonic Mystery Weapon Released Its Own Payload And Nobody Knows Why (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report says that China’s apparent nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle ejected some kind of payload while barreling through the atmosphere, in its much-discussed test this past summer. If true, this would indicate an intriguing new capability for this already novel weapon, albeit one the function of which is not entirely clear. You can read our original reporting on this ostensible milestone test here . The Financial Times yesterday reported that China’s puzzling weapon test on July 27 included the presumed hypersonic glide vehicle launching some kind of payload over the South China Sea “as it approached its target traveling at least five times the speed of sound.” A Long March 2C rocket of the type thought to have been used in the July 27 trial flight involving a hypersonic glide vehicle. , CHINESE SPACE AGENCY Until now, reports had described a glide vehicle of the type intended to travel into space and traverse the globe in an orbital-like fashion before making its run through the atmosphere toward its target, what’s known as a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS. In this sense, it seemed to have much in common with certain Cold War-era concepts . FOBS offers key advantages in that it can launch strikes from the opposite direction that a large amount of existing early warning infrastructure is aimed at, doing so in a flight profile that is lower than what those systems are geared to provide early warning for. A graphic offering a basic look at the difference in flight paths between hypersonic glide vehicles and more conventional hypersonic and ballistic missiles., GAO Aside from the FOBS capability, a hypersonic glide vehicle already offers a less predictable flight path than what traditional ballistic missiles can provide, with the ability to make maneuvers within the atmosphere. This includes during its run-in to its target, making it even harder to detect and defend against. In a recent interview with CBS News , predating the latest revelation, General John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the July 27 test as having involved “a long-range missile.” Hyten added: “It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, that impacted a target in China.” General John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the No. 2 person in the U.S. military., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Dennis Hoffman Now, citing “people familiar with the intelligence,” Demetri Sevastopulo at the FT reports that the glide vehicle in question fired a “separate missile mid-flight in the atmosphere.” Adding to the overall confusion, the same FT article switches between references to a missile being launched, and delivery of unspecified countermeasures, before referencing unnamed experts who point to the use of these countermeasures as evidence of China’s supposed lead over Russia and the United States in terms of hypersonic weapons. On the other hand, the White House declined to provide the FT with a comment on the new development, instead offering a blanket statement on the original July 27 test, which it described as “concerning to us as it should be to all who seek peace and stability in the region and beyond.” Also approached by the newspaper for comment was the Chinese Embassy in London, which denied any knowledge of the weapons test having taken place. Overall, the tone of the reporting is fairly breathless, with a description of “Pentagon scientists […] caught off guard by the advance,” although it is notably thin on actual details of the system, especially how it would be expected to be relevant in a wartime scenario, or even how this the test could lead to such a system. In the meantime, however, some of the more extreme claims made seem to have been removed from the article. While Sevastopulo at one point describes this payload simply as another missile, the same article notes that “some Pentagon experts believe the projectile was an air-to-air missile,” which seems as illogical as it is improbable. At the same time, the article cites a counter view from unnamed “experts at DARPA” who assume the payload actually consisted of some kind of countermeasures intended to defeat missile defense systems like those now being developed in the United States. We are told, furthermore, that the DARPA experts are “unsure how China managed to fire countermeasures from a vehicle traveling at hypersonic speeds.” While the release of objects from vehicles flying at hypersonic speeds is an established practice in space — with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for example — the difference here is the claim that the payload was released in the atmosphere. Atmospheric release of a payload at hypersonic speeds by a glide vehicle could well be indicative of a significant technological breakthrough, especially if it involved a guided missile. Either way, this kind of feat is by no means easy to achieve without destabilizing the mothership glider as it careens through the sky at thousands of miles per hour. With all this in mind, it seems clear we have no real idea, at this stage, of what was ejected from the hypersonic vehicle, and for what reason. The FT adds that whatever was launched had “no obvious target of its own, before plunging into the [South China Sea].” Then there’s the question of whether the test described by the FT is genuinely the first of its kind, or simply the first that’s known about by the sources in question. After all, the July 27 test was followed up by another on August 13 and it’s unclear if this also involved the ejection of some kind of payload. Chinese officials, for their part, said that the initial reporting by the FT confused a test involving a peaceful reusable spaceplane for a weaponized system, a claim that The War Zone debunked here . However, the latest revelations, on the surface at least, do seem to suggest the possibility of some type of reusable vehicle with a payload capability, perhaps similar to proposals for a bomber version of the U.S. Air Force’s X-20 Dyna-Soar that was developed by Boeing during the 1960s. This possibility now seems to be gaining ground among nuclear policy experts, as well. NASA Other possibilities include the release of a reentry vehicle, similar to those used on ICBMs, during its flight through the atmosphere. At first glance, this would actually make some sense as it seems feasible and would allow the system to hit two targets along its flight path instead of one, but dealing with so much additional complexity to enable such a capability makes little sense when you look at the big picture. Another possibility is the release of some kind of other payload during the lower-altitude end-stage of flight. Whether a hypersonic glide vehicle or a spaceplane, the vehicle would have been able to maneuver to modulate the speed and trajectory for whatever it was launching, at least to a limited degree. Interestingly, since at least 2019, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the U.S. Army have been exploring the idea of deploying a loitering munition from some kind of platform, possibly a ballistic missile, flying at hypersonic speeds as part of a program called Vintage Racer . Details about this system and how it is supposed to work are extremely limited. The Army has separately discussed the possibility of using its future Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) ballistic missile to deploy swarms of loitering munitions or other kinds of drones. While there are some broad similarities in the little we know about these concepts—China’s recent test and the Vintage Racer initiative—there is nothing to say that they are related in any meaningful way. A graphic from a 2019 US Army briefing slide depicting how a PrSM ballistic missile might deploy a swarm of loitering munitions., US Army Whatever the truth might be behind China’s July 27 test, and Beijing’s emerging hypersonic technologies — which include the in-service DF-17 that also makes use of a hypersonic glide vehicle — it’s clear that the country’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Forces (PLARF) are making significant strides across a range of capabilities, including an apparently fast-expanding ICBM force . Mock-ups of the DF-17, which uses the rocket booster from the DF-16B short-range ballistic missile. On top, instead of a traditional warhead, is an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle., CHINESE INTERNET The hypersonic advances are something that U.S. officials have been alluding to increasingly in recent months, especially as apparent Chinese progress is weighed up against high-profile test failures for equivalent U.S. weapons. General Hyten described the FOBS-capable hypersonic glide vehicle as “a first-use weapon,” noting that “from a technology perspective, it’s pretty impressive […] I think it probably should create a sense of urgency.” In this context, “first-use” refers to the types of weapons optimized for launching a first strike, potentially upsetting the nuclear balance between China and the United States. Beijing’s previous nuclear posture was based upon ‘minimum deterrence,’ with a smaller overall weapons stockpile. U.S. officials have predicted that China’s nuclear arsenal will grow from the current estimated figure in the low 200s to up to 1,000 warheads by 2030. Meanwhile, back in September, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall also raised the possibility of the Chinese military working on a FOBS-like weapon at the Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference. “If you use that kind of an approach, you don’t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory,” he said . “It’s a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems.” With all this in mind, the case for hypersonic defense is only becoming more urgent. In the United States, for example, Rear Admiral Tom Druggan, the program executive for Aegis ballistic missile defense, last week described the SM-6 missile as “our leading defense capability for hypersonic missile defense.” Druggan added that the island of Guam “would absolutely need” the SM-6 missile to defend against these kinds of attacks. Guam is well known to be a key target for Chinese missile attacks in a wider conflict. The Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, has also recently selected Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman to compete in developing a new Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), intended to defeat hypersonic missiles in the midcourse portion of their unpowered flight. The Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones (DDG53) launches a Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) during a live-fire test of the ship’s Aegis weapons system in June 2014., U.S. Navy Back in June, the MDA provided an animated video presentation that specifically laid outs its “multi-layered solution to defend against the next generation of hypersonic glide vehicles.” Countering maneuvering hypersonic threats is incredibly challenging and includes very small windows for engagement. As it sits now, there is no robust defense against these systems. While in many ways perplexing, the limited evidence pointing to the release of some kind of payload by the hypersonic vehicle used in the July 27 test seems to suggest China is working on a truly novel set of advanced technologies. However, with so little information currently available in the public realm, it’s too early to make any hard conclusions about the nature of exactly what was tested and what its impact could be on the already in flux strategic landscape vis-a-vis China. Update 11/23/2021: In another development that could be relevant to this mysterious new Chinese weapon, the country’s state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) announced yesterday that its FL-64 wind tunnel had passed a series of calibration tests, a major step toward making it fully operational. FL-64, which AVIC’s Aerodynamics Research Institute operates, can simulate speeds between Mach 4 and Mach 8. “The wind tunnel can meet the test requirements of hypersonic aircraft such as conventional force/pressure measurement, air inlet, dynamic simulation, weapon separation and release, aerodynamic heat and flow display,” according to a machine translation of a story from China Aviation News , an outlet that AVIC owns. The specific mention of “weapon separation and release” is, of course, particularly interesting in light of this recent report regarding this novel Chinese hypersonic weapon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 27, 2021",Ukrainian Troops Have Been Firing American-Made Javelin Missiles At Russian-Backed Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of Ukraine’s top military intelligence agency has confirmed, for what appears to be the first time, that Ukrainian troops in the country’s eastern Donbass region have fired American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles at Russian or Russian-supported forces . These missiles, along with other advanced weapons that the Ukrainian military has acquired in recent years, such as Turkish Bayraktar TB2 armed drones , would be important factors in the outcome of any future major military confrontation with Russia. Fears are growing that the Kremlin could at least be prepared to launch a new, large-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine as early as January. Ukrainian Brigadier General Kyrylo Budanov talked about the operational use of Javelins as part of a recent interview with Military Times , which he conducted through an interpreter. Budanov, who runs the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, also known by its Ukrainian acronym GUR MOU, used the opportunity to call for more help from the U.S. government as he sounded like the alarm about the Kremlin’s unusual deployments of large numbers of military units to areas opposite Russia’s borders with Ukraine in recent weeks. “We need more [military assistance]. No countries except Ukraine have open war with Russia. And we have for seven years,” Budanov told Military Times . “That’s why we’re sure the U.S. should give us everything we didn’t get before. And right now. It’s the right time for this. Because after, it could be very late.” In 2014, Russia seized and then annexed Ukraine’s Crimea region , an overt operation that was preceded by the covert deployment of special operations units and conventional troops, who were dubbed “ little green men ” on account of their unmarked green camouflage uniforms. That same year, the Kremlin sent additional forces into the Donbass to directly support ostensibly local “separatists,” groups that have since been shown to have strong ties to Russian intelligence agencies. Heavy armor and artillery have been important features of this conflict, which has been ongoing ever since. The U.S. government’s decision to approve the sale of Javelins to Ukraine in 2018 was a major shift in policy and was seen as a clear attempt to bolster Ukraine’s ability to challenge any new Russian-supported offensive. The Javelin is a very capable man-portable guided anti-tank missile that can either be fired straight at a target or via a pop-up maneuver, after which it dives down onto the target. This latter mode of operation is valuable for engaging tanks and other armored vehicles, which typically have more limited armor protection on top, as well as various targets situated behind hard cover. The reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) has a thermal imaging system with 12x magnification, giving the complete weapon a secondary surveillance capability, as well. Javelins also have a limited ability to engage low-flying helicopters. However, it was not until last year that the U.S. government’s end-use agreements allowed Ukrainian troops to actually bring these weapons to the front lines in Donbas, so long as they were used “defensively.” Initially, the Ukrainian government had been prohibited from deploying these weapons except in the event of a more overt westward Russian invasion of the country. Budanov did not provide any details about when the Javelins were first used against enemy forces in Donbass or under what circumstances. The War Zone has reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense for more information. However, skirmishes along the so-called “line of contact” that separates “separatist” occupied areas from the rest of Ukraine, including dueling artillery fire, occur on a somewhat regular basis. Just in October, the Ukrainian military announced that it had carried out the first-ever strike using one of its armed TB2s, employing the drone to destroy a hostile 122-mm D-30 howitzer that had been shelling its positions. Javelin has a demonstrated ability to hit targets up to nearly three miles away , which would certainly enable Ukrainian forces to engage threats on the other side of the line of contact. A map, dated Nov. 22, 2021, from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, which shows, among other things, the approximate line of contact between areas occupied by Russian-supported forces and the rest of the country. , OSCE Ukraine’s combat use of any of its Javelins is a significant development, demonstrating the country’s willingness and ability to employ these weapons now that it has approval from the U.S. government. Budanov specifically told Military Times that the Javelins, along with the TB2 drones, have “a significant psychological deterrent value … making Russians think twice about attacking.” Any deterrents the Ukrainian military has are perhaps now more important than ever, with concerns that a flood of Russian troops into the region could give the Kremlin the option of launching a major invasion within a matter of weeks. Budanov provided Military Times with a briefing slide, seen below, outlining how Russia might execute such an operation, with thousands of troops simultaneously attacking from Russian territory to the north and east of the country, as well as Crimea and the Black Sea to the south. Russian forces in Belarus and in Transnistria, an almost entirely unrecognized breakaway region of Moldova situated to the west of Ukraine, might also be called upon to support a new military intervention. Ukrainian MoD via Military Times The scenario outlined in the slide Budanov gave to Military Times shows the total Russian force consisting of around 40 “battalion tactical groups,” or BTGs, which can have between 700 and 900 total personnel, each. This would put the total size of the force at between 28,000 and 36,000 troops. The maps show a mixture of armored, mechanized infantry, and airborne infantry BTGs. Satellite imagery, as well as pictures and video taken on the ground in recent weeks, show significant amounts of heavy armor, self-propelled artillery, and even Iskander short-range ballistic missiles now in the region. It has been pointed out that there were reportedly 53 BTGs deployed in parts of Russia opposite Ukraine in April, when there were also fears of a major imminent crisis erupting. The Russian military deployed 51 BTGs for its large-scale Zapad 2021 exercise , which took place in parts of western Russia and Belarus in September. However, as The War Zone reported at the time , even after tensions defused somewhat earlier this year, large amounts of armored vehicles, artillery, and other weapons and equipment remained in place as some troops withdrew. Certain units did not appear to actually return to their usual garrisons, either. All of this offers the Kremlin a way to rapidly enlarge its total force in the region if desired. The Russian military has significantly expanded its permanent presence near Ukraine, as well, especially in Crimea, which now hosts significant numbers of combat aircraft , ground-based anti-ship missiles , and more. It is home now to the headquarters of the Russian Navy’s Black Sea fleet, which has various warships, submarines , and amphibious warfare vessels , assigned to it. Air and missile strikes against Ukraine staged from deeper within Russia would almost certainly be part of any such future operation. Ukrainian officials and members of Congress in the United States have voiced concerns about the Ukrainian military’s limited air- and missile-defense capabilities and have previously issued calls to improve them in the face of threats from the Kremlin. President Joe Biden’s administration is now debating whether or not to send air-defense systems, including Stinger shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, to Ukraine, according to CNN . The same report said that U.S. officials were also looking at the possibility of sending weapons and other equipment, including Russian-made Mi-17 Hip transport helicopters, a type Ukraine operates , that either would have gone to Afghanistan or perhaps even previously belonged to the now-defunct U.S.-backed Afghan military. The War Zone was the first to report this weekend that three ex-Afghan Air Force Mi-17s had arrived at the U.S. Air Force’s boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and that it was unclear what might happen to those helicopters in the future. In the meantime, despite the framing of much of the reporting surrounding the situation, Ukrainian, American, and other officials seem to be in agreement that a possible Russian invasion next January or February is not inevitable. “They [the Russians] want to foment unrest, through protests and meetings, that show the people are against the government,” Budanov told Military Times . Russian President Vladimir Putin is still trying to figure out whether to “go through the Ukrainian border and burn the bridges, or he is still bargaining and trying to find something interesting for him,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told The Washington Post last week. “I hope he has not made his decision on this point.” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov speaks during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and other U.S. officials at the Pentagon on Nov. 18, 2021., AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta “Our intelligence, American intelligence, and U.K. intelligence — we have the same perception,” Reznikov added, speaking specifically about possible territory Russia might be interested in occupying. “Our [intelligence] evaluations are almost the same as our American colleagues,” Budanov had also told Military Times . “We are not sure exactly what Mr. Putin is up to,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said last week ahead of his meeting with Reznikov, echoing sentiments that he and other U.S. officials have been expressing about the situation for weeks now. “But these movements certainly have our attention. And I would urge Russia to be more transparent about what they are up to take steps to live up to the Minsk agreements.” U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, at right, together with his Ukrainian counterpart, Defense Minister Reznikov, on Nov. 18. , AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta The “Minsk agreements” refer to deals mediated by France and Germany since 2014 to try to bring an end to conflict in eastern Ukraine. Last week, French and German authorities issued an unusually strong statement in support of Ukraine and criticizing the Kremlin’s commitment to the Minsk deals. Putin responded in turn by accusing Ukrainian authorities of attempting to sabotage the negotiations, which has been a talking point in the past , and warning that his country’s “red lines” on Ukraine and other issues were not being properly respected . There has also been a spike in rhetoric emanating from the Kremlin that is clearly seeking to frame Ukrainian officials as the ones acting in extreme and threatening ways and that they are forcing Russia to flex its military muscles. This is a kind of deflection commonly associated with Russian disinformation campaigns. This has all raised new concerns about a potential impending invasion. U.S. government and other officials have also accused Russia of leveraging unrest elsewhere, especially over the border crisis in Belarus, which you can read more about here , to distract from what is happening around Ukraine. Whether or not Putin has decided already to launch a new major armed intervention into Ukraine or not, there are certainly a host of reasons why he could determine doing so would be worth the consequences. The most immediate perhaps is the fact that Ukrainian authorities continue to block the free flow of water into Crimea, which has become a crisis on the peninsula. A land grab in southern Ukraine could help secure the necessary water supplies. Beyond that, Putin may simply be concerned that Russia is steadily losing its military edge against Ukraine, with its Javelins, TB2s, and other new weaponry. TB2s, in particular, have been used to blunt Russian-backed offensives in Libya and in Syria in recent years. They were also a major factor in Azerbaijan’s decisive victory over Armenia , another Russian partner, in a brief war last year. If the viability of any future military intervention for any reason appears to be slipping away, this could push the Kremlin to at least consider launching one now while it is still an option. Putin himself has been under unusually significant pressure domestically in recent years, as well. There might be a view that a more open, large-scale war with Ukraine could distract domestic political opponents, even if the outcome isn’t entirely in Russia’s favor. Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief, like other Ukrainian officials, hopes that ongoing U.S. and other foreign military assistance together with pressure from the international community will be enough to keep Russia at bay. The U.S. government has delivered new shipments of ammunition to Ukraine just in recent weeks. Though there have been some calls from members of Congress to do so, the Pentagon has, so far, not shown any indication that it plans to send large amounts of troops to help hold the line, which would be a major escalation. CNN did report today that the Biden Administration was considering sending additional advisory personnel . U.S. military warships have been operating in the Black Sea recently and U.S. military manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, as well as those from other countries in Europe, are clearly monitoring developments in the region. At the same time, it is worth remembering that western ISR flights in this part of the world have been commonplace since 2014 and that American warships do regularly make trips in and out of the Black Sea for exercises and other missions . So far, “they [the Russians] want to make the situation inside the country more and more dangerous and hard and make a situation where we have to change the government,” Budanov told Military Times . “If they can’t do that, then military troops will do their job.” Whether or not a Russian invasion will materialize in the coming months remains to be seen, but unlike in 2014, Ukraine has new weapons, like its Javelins and TB2s, along with international partners who are keeping a very close eye on the situation.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 28, 2021",Testing Of The Secretive New AIM-260 Long-Range Air-To-Air Missile Is Well Underway,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has been busy flying QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target , or FSAT, missions in support of the Lockheed Martin AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile program. While the AIM-260, or JATM, remains a highly secretive weapon, it’s now clear that test work is well underway, with around 30 FSAT missions last year alone. This would make sense given that the goal is to have the new missile start arming Air Force and Navy aircraft as early as next year. Our Twitter contact @MIL_STD brought attention to the new developments after examining publicly released Air Force data recording various test missions flown by the QF-16 FSAT fleet. This consists of F-16 fighter jets converted to drones and used as targets and also flown as manned test assets for chase and range instrumentation flights. In drone mode, these aircraft are not always shot down even during live-fire events as often the missiles hurled at them are not equipped with live warheads. As such, close enough, within the blast radius of the missile’s warheads, can be considered a kill. You can read more about these jets here . A QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target from the 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron flies over the Gulf of Mexico during an unmanned, or NULLO, flight at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida., U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. J. Scott Wilcox The Air Force first disclosed the existence of the AIM-260 program, which is a joint effort with the Navy, in 2019. Those two services intend for this missile to provide a new, longer-range weapon to replace the ubiquitous AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile ( AMRAAM ). @MIL_STD’s entire Twitter thread, portions of which are embedded below, is well worth a look, but the key details reveal that the FSAT fleet has been supporting JATM test work since April 2020, if not before. In that month, there were eight QF-16 missions in support of the new missile. Whether some or all of these flights involved actual missile launches is unclear, although it’s certainly possible. Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida was the launch point for these missions and the facility and its target drones are regularly used to support live-fire missile sorties . In the past, it was stated that JATM flight tests should begin this year. Later in 2020, there seems to have another relative spike in JATM test activity, with six missions flown by the QF-16s in October alone, and another two missions canceled. At the same time, it should be remembered that the FSAT activity detailed in these documents is just one aspect of a much broader joint Air Force/Navy program on the path to getting the missile into service. While the Air Force is yet to release any such data for this year, it’s clear that 2020 saw plenty of activity for the AIM-260 program, making the fact that these missions have not so far been spotted by photographers or other observers all the more surprising. That is unless the AIM-260 looks nearly identical to the AIM-120 it replaces, which would be an accomplishment considering its supposed major step-up in capability over the already extended-range AIM-120D . Footage of a test missile fired against an unmanned QF-16: A video showing QF-4s, the predecessor to the QF-16 in the FSAT role: Overall, the data from 2020 provides a tantalizing glimpse into a program that is being run very much out of the public eye. So secretive is the new missile, in fact, that the Air Force has invested $6.5 million in building a Joint Advanced Tactical Missile Storage Facility at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, to help keep it secure under Special Access Program security requirements. A satellite image of Hill AFB, where the sprawling munitions storage area in the northwest corner is being adapted for the AIM-260 JATM., GOOGLE EARTH What we do know about the JATM itself has come primarily from brief comments made by Air Force leaders and other officials. Indeed, for a long time, the only official mention of the program that was publicly available online was a vague reference about the assistant program manager, an employee of Naval Air Systems Command, winning an award for outstanding logisticians in 2017. Nevertheless, the new missile is expected to not only out-range the AIM-120 but offer performance that at least matches Chinese and Russian efforts in the field of very long-range air-to-air missiles. The Air Force has publicly said that the emergence of the Chinese PL-15 , a long-range air-to-air missile featuring a dual-pulse rocket motor, was a key factor in the decision to start the AIM-260 program. A Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35S fighter jet test-fires a very-long-range R-37M long-range air-to-air missile., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SCREENCAP What we do know about the AIM-260 is that the new missile will have the same general diameter and length as AIM-120. This will, among other things, allow it to be carried inside internal weapons bays on stealth fighters that were designed to accommodate the AMRAAM. The dimensional requirements mean that a ramjet powerplant, as used in the pan-European Meteor missile , is impossible. So, a new type of solid-fuel motor seems to be a given, perhaps a dual-pulse type to ensure energy across the flight envelope just like on the PL-15. As Aviation Week’s defense editor Steve Trimble has pointed out, this new propulsion unit could be combined with miniaturization of other components as a way of increasing the fuel load to eke out yet more range. Advanced highly-loaded grain propellant, which is also being developed for use in other air-to-air missiles , could help improve performance without increasing the overall form factor. Trimble has pointed out that different options exist for the warhead, including a directional warhead, which could be smaller than the standard type, but with more accuracy meaning that it could be scaled down. Another option, as we have discussed in detail before, would be a hit-to-kill type missile, with no actual explosive charge, which is another concept that has been discussed in the past in relation to more compact air-to-air missile designs. As well as the new missile itself, the Air Force is meanwhile busy working on other measures to extend the range at which enemy aircraft can be engaged in the air. This includes fielding new and more capable sensors, such as powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and infrared search and track systems . Then there is the work on collaborative aerial engagements, including using networked and third-party sensors to provide targeting data for engagements without the launching aircraft locking the target up themselves. Recent exercises have focused on these types of complex ‘kill chain’ engagements, while the range at which the existing AMRAAM is being employed, in tests at least, is also increasing . Speaking exclusively to The War Zone last year, Lieutenant Colonel Orion “Rhino” Vail, commander of Tyndall’s 83rd Fighter Weapons Squadron, pointed out the impetus behind speeding up the introduction of new technology in support of operational testing. “We are trying to do all we can in accelerating the future faster,” he said. When asked specifically about the AIM-260, Vail confirmed: “I’ve been involved in discussions about that weapon.” Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that the AIM-260 will very likely be joined by other advanced long-range air-to-air weapons. Separate to the JATM program is the Long Range Engagement Weapon (LREW) project, being developed by Raytheon. Boeing recently unveiled a concept for a two-stage weapon, the Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, which you can read about here . A model of the Boeing Long-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or LRAAM, was unveiled in September this year., JOSEPH TREVITHICK While the technical aspects of the AIM-260 remain classified, it has been confirmed that the Pentagon aims for the weapon to achieve initial operating capability next year . Much of that urgency, it seems, is driven by AAM developments in China, especially, amid concerns that the People’s Liberation Army might be increasingly able to outrange American fighter jets with their own advanced air-to-air missiles . Overall, while this is an ambitious timeline, but with this in mind, it should be no surprise that testing of the new weapon is now in full flow.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 269 (HMLA-269), the “Gunrunners,” is now sporting an AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter in a camouflage scheme that is a direct throwback to the AH-1J/T Sea Cobras and AH-1W Super Cobras the unit operated over the decades following its establishment in 1971. In fact, it was the first designated attack helicopter squadron in Marine Corps history. So, some sort of commemoration for 50 years at the tip of the Marine Corps’ spear is in order. Images of the green, charcoal, and gray AH-1Z were taken during a recent training exercise in Colorado. The exercise focused on cold-weather, high-altitude drills that would better prepare the unit for expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO). The unit is home-based at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina. In a response to a question about the paint scheme on Twitter, the 2d Marine Air Wing stated: “This specific helicopter is HMLA-269’s flagship bird. It’s given the number 71 to commemorate their inception in 1971, and the colors are a homage to their service in the Middle East.” Marines prep HMLA-269’s camouflaged AH-1Z for another mission during high-altitude, cold-weather training in Colorado. , USMC/2nd MAW It’s great to see HMLA-269 play up its rich heritage. Its Cobras have made a lot of history while wearing this ‘sea snake’ camouflage. This has included extensive operations in Iraq during both wars there and a number of firsts dealing with updated weapon systems employment. But probably most famously, back in 1995, a pair of the unit’s Cobras wearing this exact scheme escorted a pair of CH-53Es off the USS Kearsarge and deep into enemy territory to rescue Air Force Capt.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2022",Taiwan Has Declared Its Upgraded F-16V Fighter Jets Fully Operational,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan has officially introduced to service its first wing of upgraded F-16V fighter jets , the most advanced in its inventory, as the Republic of China Air Force, or ROCAF, continues to face down its Chinese adversary amid tensions between Beijing and Taipei. In the process, Taiwan has become the first Viper operator anywhere in the world to field combat-capable F-16Vs. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen was at Chiayi Air Base in southwest Taiwan today to formally declare the resident 4th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) fully operational, as the first ROCAF wing to be equipped with F-16Vs. She inspected the flight line at the base and was photographed seated in the cockpit of an F-16V, as seen at the top of this story. According to reports , 64 of the jets have now been upgraded, but it’s not clear if all of these are assigned to Chiayi. The event had been expected to take place earlier in the year but was delayed, reportedly by a combination of the COVID pandemic and a number of accidents involving ROCAF aircraft. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen inspects newly commissioned upgraded F-16V fighter jets at Chiayi Air Base on November 18, 2021., AP Photo/Johnson Lai “I believe that as long as we adhere to the values of democracy and freedom, there will be more like-minded countries standing on the same front with us,” President Tsai said at the event, according to Reuters , calling for international support as the country continues its face-off with Beijing, which has not ruled out retaking the island by force. Today’s milestone follows an announcement in March this year that the first F-16Vs had achieved initial combat capability at Chiayi, signaling the start of active training on the jets. At that point, it was reported that more than 22 F-16Vs had been delivered to the 4th TFW. A ROCAF F-16 fighter on a section of a highway during a military drill in Tainan city, southern Taiwan, in 2011., AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying Originally, the ROCAF expected to receive 144 F-16Vs, which are conversions of its existing F-16A/B jets, but this number has since been reduced to 141 through attrition in its existing Viper fleet. Lockheed Martin upgraded the first two ROCAF F-16Vs, the first of which took to the air in October 2015, and these served as pattern aircraft for Taiwan’s Aerospace Industry Development Center (AIDC) to complete the remaining upgrades locally. Work to retrofit the whole fleet is due for completion by the end of 2023. The next wing to be equipped with the upgraded jets will be the 5th TFW at Hualien Air Base on the northeast coast. While the F-16V name is applied almost universally to these aircraft, AIDC refers to them as F-16A/B Block 20 MLUs. Although we’ve already discussed in some depth the advantages of the Taiwanese F-16V configuration, it’s worth noting that these fighters now possess the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), with an active electronically scanned array (AESA), providing much-increased detection and engagement ranges. You can read all about the particular features that the SABR brings to the F-16 in this previous feature of ours. Maintenance personnel install mounting hardware for the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar on a U.S. Air Force 416th Flight Test Squadron F-16 in August 2015., U.S. Air Force / Christopher Okula At the same time, information from the SABR and from other sensors is now presented on a new center pedestal display, for improved tactical situational awareness. Another important development is the introduction of more robust landing gear, able to take heavier fuel and weapons loads. This will be especially important for the F-16V’s offensive missions, which include anti-shipping, using the AGM-84 Harpoon missile . Other important weapons capabilities likely to be incorporated in the Taiwanese F-16V include the AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation ( HARM ) missile for defense suppression, the AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon ( JSOW ), and the Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response ( SLAM-ER ). Of these, the SLAM-ER with its range of 170 miles will provide a powerful new long-range precision-strike capability with a range greater and better accuracy than the indigenous Wan Chien missile. Sales of the JSOW and SLAM-ER to Taiwan were approved in 2017 and 2020, respectively. A 4th TFW F-16 displayed with some of its weapons options at Chiayi., YOUTH DAILY NEWS Despite all these advances, however, the F-16V is still very much a fourth-generation fighter, its overall capabilities likely far outstripped by the J-20 stealth fighters now being fielded by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. Tellingly, while the numerical supremacy of Beijing’s air arms has never been in question, its qualitative advantage is also now growing, with other stealth fighters in the works, not to mention increasingly advanced drones and air-launched weapons. With this in mind, it was recently reported that at least some U.S. officials had become frustrated at Taiwan’s persistence on acquiring high-tech systems instead of lower-cost equipment that would be easier to acquire and could arguably be more effective in at least buying time in the face of Chinese military intervention. The Chengdu J-20 now in frontline PLAAF service., CHINESE INTERNET Ultimately, the introduction of the F-16V is just the start of ROCAF fighter modernization plans, with the Trump administration having approved the sale to Taiwan of an additional 66 new-build Block 70 F-16C/D jets , which are new production aircraft with a similar general configuration to the F-16V. The first deliveries of these jets are expected to begin in 2023. The fact that Washington eventually approved the sale of these advanced fighters was an important milestone in itself, the deal having been a “red line” issue for the government in Beijing, while successive U.S. administrations had refused to allow more modern F-16 versions to be delivered. A ROCAF graphic showing a likely Block 70 F-16C/D configuration for Taiwan., ROCAF In the meantime, the declaration of full operational capability for the F-16V comes at a significant moment, with activity by aircraft from the People’s Liberation Army in Taiwan’s southwest Air Defense Identification Zone , or ADIZ, at a high. Last month, China sent a record number of aircraft into the southwest ADIZ — 149 aircraft over the course of four days, including 56 in one day alone. These incidents come amid growing fears about a Chinese military intervention on the island. Last month , Taiwanese Minister of Defense Chiu Kuo-cheng said that, while China was capable now, it would be fully prepared to launch a full-scale invasion in three years. This echoes a statement from U.S. Navy Adm. Phil Davidson, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that China aims to invade Taiwan “in the next six years.” A Taiwanese F-16 escorts a missile-armed People’s Liberation Army Air Force H-6K bomber., AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying This all comes in the same week that U.S. President Joe Biden was forced to backtrack on statements that endorsed Taiwan’s independence, following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Last month, Biden had also said that the U.S. military would defend Taiwan if China attacked it, but said he would not commit to sending troops, in line with the Taiwan Relations Act. With that in mind, the official deployment of the F-16V is not only a sign of modernization of Taiwan’s armed forces as a counter to China’s rapidly developing airpower capabilities but also a reminder that the ROCAF is ready to defend the island in the face of Beijing’s territorial claims on it. At the same time, it may be seen as reinforcing the close military relationship between the United States and Taiwan, despite the former’s official “one China” policy that falls short of recognizing Taiwan’s independence.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",Trio Of Afghan Mi-17 Helicopters Quietly Arrive At The U.S. Air Force’s Boneyard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Three Russian-made Mi-17 Hip helicopters that previously belonged to the now-defunct Afghan Air Force arrived at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona yesterday and are set to be placed in storage at the boneyard there . These aircraft appear to be from among those that Afghan pilots and other personnel used to escape to neighboring Uzbekistan as the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August . This is also the first concrete evidence that American authorities are taking custody of at least some of the ex-Afghan military aircraft now scattered around the world, the vast majority of which were originally purchased by the U.S. government. Thanks to the help from @az.aviator on Instagram , we have learned that the trio of helicopters arrived at Davis-Monthan inside the lone Antonov An-124 Ruslan cargo plane belonging to Maximus Air , a division of the United Arab Emirates-based Abu Dhabi Aviation Group, according to a separate source familiar with the shipment. This also appears to be the first time Maximus Air’s An-124, which carries the Ukrainian registration code UR-ZYD, has visited anywhere in the United States. Maximus Air’s An-124 Ruslan cargo aircraft., Eduard Onyshchenko via Wikimedia While we can’t say with absolute certainty where UR-ZYD first picked up the helicopters, online flight tracking software shows that plane flew from Abu Dhabi International Airport in the UAE to Bukhara International Airport in Uzbekistan on Nov. 10, 2021. That same day it flew back to UAE, but landed at Al Ain International Airport. Then, on Nov. 17, it left Al Ain for Davis-Monthan, flying there by way of Oslo in Norway and Denver, Colorado. Data from flight-tracking website FlightAware showing UR-ZYD’s flight to Uzbekistan on Nov. 10., FlightAware The government of Uzbekistan had said back in August that some 22 fixed-wing aircraft and 24 helicopters that had belonged to Afghan Air Force had made their way across the border. Satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained confirmed that the vast majority, if not all of those aircraft had touched down at Termez Airport, which is situated less than 10 miles from Afghanistan. In addition to Mi-17s, the helicopters that made it to Uzbekistan included a number of UH-60A+ Black Hawks . A-29 light attack aircraft , AC-208 armed light utility planes , Cessna 208 Caravan small transports, and Pilatus PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms were among the ex-Afghan Air Force fixed-wing types observed at Termez. A satellite image showing various ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft, including Mi-17s, at Termez Airport in Uzbekistan on Aug. 16, 2021., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Bukhara is located some 230 miles northwest of Termez and it would not necessarily have been hard to relocate any of these aircraft there for shipment elsewhere. When reached for comment, the U.S. Air Force declined to confirm whether or not the Mi-17s had previously belonged to the Afghan Air Force, but did acknowledge their arrival and offer some additional context. “The Defense Security Cooperation Management Office-Afghanistan is retrograding U.S. and multi-national aircraft from U.S. and overseas maintenance support facilities to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona,” Derek Kaufman, a spokesperson for Air Force Material Command (AFMC) told The War Zone . “We are unable to provide details on timeline for future arrivals, however, we can confirm that three Mi-17s arrived today.” The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) is the unit in charge of the boneyard at Davis-Monthan. The Pentagon established the Defense Security Cooperation Management Office-Afghanistan in Qatar in July as part of the planned drawdown of U.S. forces from Afghanistan prior to the Taliban takeover. That office’s main job had been to coordinate security assistance programs for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), “to include over the horizon aircraft maintenance support,” U.S. officials had explained at the time of its creation. Previously, this support had flowed through an office in Afghanistan itself. Depending on what the U.S. government’s exact plan is now, dozens of former Afghan Air Force helicopters, as well as fixed-wing aircraft, could be headed to the boneyard in the near future. In addition to Uzbekistan, Afghan Air Force pilots and other military personnel used various types of aircraft to make their way to neighboring Tajikistan as the Taliban completed their takeover of Afghanistan in August. The fleeing Afghans were initially detained by Uzbek and Tajik authorities, but in both cases they have since been able to leave those countries thanks in part to U.S. diplomatic assistance. Who actually owns those aircraft, along with other ex-Afghan Air Force airframes in the United States or other countries, has been unclear. In its most recent quarterly report, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR , said it was aware of at least six helicopters, a mixture of Mi-17s and UH-60A+s, that were outside of Afghanistan undergoing depot maintenance when the Taliban seized power. Reports from outlets in Afghanistan had suggested that there were as many as 25 aircraft in other countries for repairs. Another 37 UH-60s that the U.S. government had bought for the Afghan Air Force, but had yet to deliver, are also somewhere in the United States, according to SIGAR. Its latest quarterly report said that the Department of Defense managed to get two Hughes MD 530F armed light scout helicopters out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul during the final withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. The Department of Defense has not yet responded to queries from The War Zone regarding the status of these or any other ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft. A table showing the Afghan Air Force’s total inventory as of July 2021, according to data compiled by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. As noted, the table does not include figures for aircraft that were assigned to the Special Mission Wing (SMW), a secretive Afghan special operations aviation unit. The SMW was, among other things, the sole operator of Afghanistan’s PC-12NG ISR aircraft, which therefore do not appear in this table at all., SIGAR It has always been extremely likely that the U.S. government would use all available means to secure these aircraft or otherwise block their transfer to the Taliban. How and where American authorities could legally take possession of those assets has been much less clear, despite having paid for almost all of them initially. “I would appreciate it if we could put that in writing to both of those countries that the equipment belongs to the U.S. — not to Afghanistan,” Rep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican, told Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the hearing in September with regards to former Afghan Air Force aircraft in Tajikistan. While we don’t know the specifics, the U.S. government has clearly begun to recover some aircraft that had belonged to the Afghan Air Force and consolidate them at the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. What will happen to them after they arrive remains to be seen. It’s worth mentioning that shadowy American flying units tied to the Central Intelligence Agency have long flown the Mi-8/17 type in small numbers and in modified form . While ceasing operations in Afghanistan would have greatly diminished the demand for these platforms, it would not have eliminated them totally. It is possible that parts from the Afghan Mi-17s could be used to help sustain U.S. operations of the type. Other aircraft of Russian design that have turned up in U.S. possession, sometimes after careers in clandestine test, evaluation, and training operations, have been turned into ground training enrichment aids or have been put on display at various locales. Regardless, just taking possession of these helicopters and letting them slowly fade into oblivion at the Pentagon’s sun-soaked boneyard in Tucson may be deemed mission accomplished by some, at least to a degree, considering how contested the topic of the status of these aircraft has become.

Brian O'Rourke,"Posted on Aug 3, 2021",First Littoral Combat Ship With Fix To Plagued Combining Gear Delivered To Navy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) announced yesterday that the U.S. Navy had taken delivery of the future Minneapolis-St. Paul (LCS-21), a Freedom -class littoral combat ship (LCS). The vessel’s delivery was delayed principally because of problems with a part of its drivetrain known as the combining gear, an issue that has affected the entire class. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday recently called the combining gear problems as “the most challenging engineering problem that we’ve seen on any class of ship since I’ve been in the Navy,” but the service is hopeful that the fix implemented on this particular vessel will eventually solve the issue for the whole class. Minneapolis-St. Paul was originally scheduled to be commissioned in spring 2021, but the Navy stopped accepting new Freedom-class LCSs in January until the fix could be developed. The redesigned gear will now be retrofitted onto the other Freedom -class ships still in service. At the Navy League’s Sea Air Space symposium in August, LCS Deputy Program Manager Howard Berkof told USNI News that it would likely take two years to repair all the ships. The problematic gear is located deep inside the hull. The USS Milwaukee (LCS-5), Sioux City (LCS-11), Wichita (LCS-13), Billings (LCS-15), Indianapolis (LCS-17), and St. Louis (LCS-19) should all receive the fix. The class’s namesake, Freedom (LCS-1), was decommissioned at the end of September and will join the reserve fleet. Three other early ships in the class — USS Fort Worth (LCS-3), Detroit (LCS-7), and Little Rock (LCS-9) — are scheduled to be decommissioned next March. Congress has not yet authorized those decommissionings, though, so the other older ships’ repair status is uncertain. Any that are decommissioned seem very unlikely to receive the redesigned gear, however, since saving money on repairs was the Navy’s primary rationale for the early retirements. Fort Worth actually suffered a combining gear breakdown in 2016 and today is equipped with a gear that is different from any of the other Freedom class ships in commission. The combining gear is an important part of the design of the Freedom class’ propulsion system. These ships use a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) system, which pairs diesel engines with gas turbines. In a typical CODAG system, during normal cruise operations, the diesels run the propulsion system, but the gas turbines can provide a high-speed boost when needed. It is a fairly common arrangement on ships — the U.S. Coast Guard’s Sentinel- class national security cutters use CODAG systems, for example. But unlike most Navy and Coast Guard ships, the Freedom class does not have traditional propellers. Instead, the engines power a waterjet system . For the Freedom class, the top speed on combined engines is supposed to be greater than 40 knots . On diesel engines alone, the ship is limited to about 10 to 12 knots . The internal-combustion diesel engines produce power by turning at one set of speeds, while the Rolls Royce gas-turbine engines turn at others. It requires a combining gear to match speeds. This gear has been plagued from very early on with problems in its bearings — devices that keep shafts turning smoothly and limit excess vibration. Defense News ’ Megan Eckstein has reported that the new combining gear replaces ball bearings with journal bearings . USNI News reported yesterday that Navy Rear Admiral Casey Moton, who heads the Program Executive Office, Unmanned and Small Combatants, which manages the LCS program, told reporters the Navy is now working to install the new gear on the Cooperstown (LCS-23). Cooperstown , the next ship in the Freedom class, is scheduled to be delivered in January. The following three ships in the class — the future Marinette (LCS-25), Nantucket (LCS-27), and Beloit (LCS-29) — will also get their combining gear replaced. The final ship, the future Cleveland (LCS-31), was just laid down in June and will receive the new gear design in the ordinary course of construction. Getting the Freedom class back to work at full speed is vital to the Navy, with the combining gear being just the latest in a litany of expensive problems . Both this class and the catamaran-hull Independence class have been testing a variety of weapons to give the little ships some big bite. But none of that matters if transmission problems keep them tied up at the pier. The Navy has not yet announced a commissioning date for the Minneapolis-St. Paul , but if the new gear works as promised, it should be soon. And then the ship named for Minnesota’s Twin Cities can join the other Freedom class ships in their homeport at Mayport, Florida, and get to work. Contact the author: Brian@Thedrive.com.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 3, 2020",This Is Our First Look At The Army’s New 20mm Aerial Cannon On An Actual Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has given us our first look at a UH-60 Black Hawk testbed carrying its new XM915 20mm Gatling-type automatic cannon and firing the gun in flight. The service expects this gun to be part of the arsenal for its Future Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft , or FARA. Bell’s Invictus 360 and Sikorsky’s Raider X , two advanced helicopter designs, are competing against each other to win the final FARA contract. The Army conducted the first aerial tests of the XM915, including firing it in flight for the first time, using the UH-60 testbed in October as part of the Project Convergence 2021 exercise. This is the second Project Convergence event to date, which the service has been using to test and evaluate a wide array of new and advanced weapons and other systems , as well as concepts of operations to go with them. Project Convergence 2021 is taking place at both the Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona and the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, and is expected to wrap up this month. “It shoots fast, it shoots well, and it shoots accurately,” Army Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Keogh, the Chief of Flight Test for U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, did say about the XM915’s performance in a statement released earlier this month . “As a previous attack and recon pilot, I like it.” The UH-60 testbed helicopter fires its XM915 cannon during Project Convergence 2021., US Army US Army US Army However, “this was a demonstration and not a performance test,” the U.S. Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Aviation and Missile Center stressed to The War Zone in another statement. “What we found is that it was successfully installed the gun on an aircraft and demonstrated its ability to function as an aerial weapon.” An XM915 20mm cannon is seen here mounted on the stub wing of a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter being used as a surrogate testbed., US Army Details about the gun, which General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) has been developing for the Army since at least 2020 , remain limited. The U.S. Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Armament Center told The War Zone that it weighs 115 pounds and that it is an electrically-driven Gatling-type design that fires 20x102mm electrically-primed ammunition. Guns that use electrical impulses rather than a traditional firing pin to detonate the primer on individual cartridges have been in use for decades and it is a design feature found on various aircraft cannons. The weapon’s rate of fire was not releasable. An XM915 seen during ground testing in 2020., US Army The weight is interesting given that the XM915 is, by every indication, an evolution of the lightweight XM301 that GD-OTS developed for the Army’s abortive Boeing-Sikorsky RAH-66A Comanche stealth scout helicopter. The XM301 is 80.5 pounds, according to the manufacturer’s website , meaning the XM915 is heavier. The XM301, as installed on the RAH-66A, also had two selectable rates of fire, 750 rounds per minute and 1,500 rounds per minute. The Comanche was designed to be a stealthy helicopter and the mounting for the XM301 allowed it to be rotated to the rear and then stowed behind a low-observable fairing when not in use. It’s unclear whether either the Invictus 360 or the Raider X are designed with similar considerations in mind, but the Bell helicopter is certainly not optimized for stealth . Artists’ conceptions of the Raider X that have been released so far do show what could be a similar fairing behind the gun turret. An RAH-66A Comanche prototype with an orange-painted rod as a stand-in for its XM301 gun., US Army A diagram showing the RAH-66A’s complete gun system, including its ability to rotate rearward for stowage., Sikorsky via The Igor I. Sikorsky Historical Archives The Comanche program was canceled in 2004 due to cost growth and technical issues, at which point the Army had already spent some $7 billion on the helicopter’s development.  The RAH-66A was intended to be a replacement for the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter, which the Army ultimately retired without a direct successor in 2017. The service subsequently established units equipped with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to perform armed reconnaissance missions . The winning FARA design is now expected to assume this and other roles as something of a spiritual successor to the OH-58D . In addition to the XM915, the FARAs are expected to be capable of firing various missiles, including the AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), along with future “Air Launched Effects,” or ALEs. The Army’s vision for the ALEs is a family of systems that includes multiple types of air-launched drones and loitering munitions , which you read more about here . The service has been testing a new Modular Effects Launcher , a launch rack designed to carry a variety of different missiles and ALEs at once, using a UH-60 surrogate at Project Convergence 2021, as well. A US Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying the Modular Effects Launcher, the orange-painted rack, with various missiles and other stores loaded onto it during Project Convergence 2021., US Army It remains to be seen whether the final FARA design that the Army picks will indeed feature the XM915. The service doesn’t expect to pick a winning offer until sometime between late 2023 and 2024. In March, Northrop Grumman unveiled a new single-barrel 20mm cannon, the Sky Viper , which the company says it is pitching to the Army as an alternative option. There is a possibility that the XM915 could be of interest to other users. Last year, the Army acquired an ex-U.S. Marine Corps AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter to use for various integration and other ground testing related to this gun. At that time, the service said that it planned to mount the cannon on a newer AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter for flight tests in the future. The AH-1Z, like the AH-1W before it, is currently armed with a 1960s-era M197 20mm Gatling-type cannon , which weighs 132 pounds. The lighter XM915 might offer a relatively easy upgrade option for AH-1Zs in Marine Corps service, as well as Vipers and older AH-1s flying in other countries around the world. The Army’s ex-Marine AH-1W at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey in 2020., US Army Beyond that, though the Army only intended its XM915-armed Black Hawk to be a surrogate testbed, together with GD-OTS, it has now demonstrated that the gun is a potentially viable option as a forward-firing weapon for variants of the S-70/H-60 family. The Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment already operates MH-60s configured as Direct Action Penetrators (DAP) armed with various forward-firing weapons, including the same 30mm M230 cannon found on the AH-64. The U.S. Navy has fielded a forward-firing gun pack containing an M197 cannon for its MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopters for use against certain close-in threats, such as small boat swarms and drones . Other countries operate variants of the Black Hawk/Sea Hawk line with forward-firing guns .

Brett Tingley and Marc Cecotti,"Updated on Aug 20, 2021",Tucson Police Helicopter Chased Eerily Similar Craft Five Years Before Recent Mystery Drone Incident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In February 2021, a Customs and Border Protection helicopter encountered a puzzlingly capable drone in the skies over Tucson, Arizona, that was able to perform like no other unmanned aerial vehicle the aircrew had previously witnessed. That helicopter called in assistance from another belonging to the Tucson Police Department, but the unmanned aircraft was able to outrun them both. In air traffic audio obtained by The War Zone , the drone’s capabilities were described as “incredible” and “ pretty freakin’ sophisticated ” by the helicopter crews that pursued it. To date, the craft remains unidentified, but it has been described as a large quadcopter-like platform featuring a single, dimly lit green position light. The two aircrews that pursued the unmanned aircraft also said it was incredibly agile, with a long endurance and a high flight ceiling. All this, combined with what appeared to be an uncanny level of situational awareness, enabled it to essentially fly circles around both of the experienced helicopter crews. In our continuing investigation of the Tucson mystery drone, The War Zone was able to obtain an Air Traffic Mandatory Occurrence Report through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that shows the unexplained drone sighting wasn’t the first of its kind to occur within the same airspace. In 2016, a nearly identical incident happened in the air over Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (DMAFB). In the earlier incident, a Tucson Police Department (TPD) helicopter also encountered an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a single dim green position light. Just as in 2021, this mystery drone was able to outrun the law enforcement helicopter as it fled westward out of the city. A Bell 206B-3 Jet Ranger operated by the Tucson Police Department Air Support., TPD via Facebook While this new information doesn’t shed any light on the drone’s configuration or the identity of its operators, it shows that, for some reason, the airspace above DMAFB attracts a certain type of visitor that is able to easily evade both local and federal law enforcement agencies. The newly obtained Air Traffic Mandatory Occurrence Report states that on December 20, 2016, Arizona Lifeline 1, a Bell 407 air ambulance helicopter flying under the callsign “LFLN1,” contacted the Tucson Approach TRACON (U90) air traffic control (ATC) facility. LFLN1 reported a UAV “ahead and to the left about 100 feet below” as it was flying around 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). The ATC towers at DMAFB and Tucson International Airport were notified, and a nearby TPD helicopter was called in to pursue the unknown drone, which is described in the report as a “ rotor variety ” UAV. The report shows the LFLN1 crew was operating under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at the time of the incident, which took place at 05:58 UTC, or just before 11:00 PM local time. FAA via FOIA Coincidentally, the TPD helicopter involved in this 2016 sighting was operating under the callsign “Air 02,” the same callsign as the one involved in the 2021 mystery drone incident . Air 02 pursued the drone westbound out of the city, which changed its altitude repeatedly as it fled the law enforcement aircraft. Eventually, Air 02 had to terminate its pursuit for reasons not stated in the report. FAA via FOIA The incident was not recorded as a Near Mid-Air Collision, or NMAC. The full description of the encounter as written in the FAA report reads as follows: LFLN1, B407, TRANSITIONING NORTH OF OMA, ENCOUNTERED A UAV AHEAD AND TO THE LEFT ABOUT 100 FEET BELOW HELICOPTER WHILE BEING APPROXIMATELY 1100 AGL. INFORMATION WAS FIRST REPORTED TO OM TOWER AND THEN REPEATED TO TUCSON APPROACH. A SECOND HELICOPTER WAS IN THE VICINITY OPERATED BY TUCSON POLICE DEPARTMENT. AIRE02, B06, OPERATED BY TPD FOUND AND FOLLOWED UAV AS IT CLIMBED AND DESCENDED WESTBOUND WELL ABOVE 1000AGL FOR SOME TIME BEFORE FINALLY TERMINATING PURSUIT. UAV WAS DIMMLY [sic] LIT BY A GREEN POSITION LIGHT AND WAS OF ROTOR VARIETY AS OBSERVED BY POLICE. The 2016 and 2021 drone encounters in Tucson share several stark similarities. For one, they both occurred in close proximity to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. In both incidents, the drone appeared to be a rotorcraft lit by a single dim, green position light. The UAVs in these incidents were both able to easily evade law enforcement helicopters, flying westward out of the city limits. The Tucson Police Air Support helicopter Air 02 was involved in each encounter, which both took place at roughly the same time at night: 10:46 PM local time in 2021 and 10:58 PM in 2016. Arizona has been the site of several unexplained or unlawful drone incidents in recent years. In 2020, The War Zone was the first to report on a troubling set of encounters above the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant , which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) referred to as a “drone-a-palooza.” The incident not only highlighted the potential for major intelligence-gathering operations on critical infrastructure via drones, but also for a future “adversarial attack” on energy infrastructure. Earlier this month, an official government report detailed that an attempted drone attack on energy infrastructure was suspected to have occurred when an off-the-shelf DJI Mavic 2 quadcopter with a copper wire suspended underneath was recovered from a Pennsylvania power substation . The Joint Intelligence Bulletin about the incident published by the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Counterterrorism Center stated that the DJI drone was “likely intended to disrupt operations by creating a short circuit to cause damage to transformers or distribution lines.” In addition, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has been reporting on illicit drone activity taking place in Arizona from across the border with Mexico since at least 2016, when 30 pounds of marijuana were discovered in Yuma in what was described as the “ first drone drug incursion detected by CBP .” Drones were discovered to have dropped narcotics in two more incidents in Yuma in 2020, one in May and one in November . In our reporting related to the Colorado and Nebraska mystery drone flap of late 2019, friend of The War Zone Douglas D. Johnson obtained internal FAA emails between Joshua Holtzman, serving then as Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for the FAA’s Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, and other employees of the FAA. In an email dated January 15, 2020, an individual with a Nebraska.gov email address whose identity has been redacted stated to Holtzman that “it appears Arizona may now be experiencing what we went through.” Holtzman shortly after wrote to other FAA investigators to state that “Nebraska State Patrol informed me this morning activity was significantly down in Nebraska but he had been informed by the Nebraska Information Analysis Center that the Arizona Center had reached out to them, reporting similar activity now in Arizona.” FAA via FOIA Our own UAV Geography tool , which is derived from UAV sighting reports published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), shows over 370 reported incidents occurring in Arizona between 2015 and 2020, with 32 taking place in Tucson where the green-lit “mystery drone” has been seen. In the most recent quarter in which data has been recorded (April to June 2021), 42 incidents were reported to the Federal Aviation Administration in Arizona alone. We continue to investigate the Tucson mystery drone encounter. For now, the addition of this new ATC Mandatory Occurrence Report shows that the bizarre incident earlier this year may not have been as isolated as was presumed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",USS Connecticut Left Port In Guam For The First Time Since Hitting A Seamount: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Seawolf class submarine USS Connecticut reportedly left port in Guam earlier today under its own power. It’s unclear what its destination might be, but we know the submarine is undergoing tests ahead of an expected voyage to Washington State. This comes more than a month after the highly advanced submarine was significantly damaged after hitting an uncharted seamount while sailing in the Pacific, an accident the service has since said was avoidable. USNI News was the first report on Connecticut ‘s apparent departure. Indications that the boat had left its berth in Apra Harbor, based on data from online ship tracking software, first began to appear on social media yesterday, including in a post from the China-based SCS Probing Initiative . The submarine has been in Guam since it arrived there on Oct. 8 , six days after its accident, which reportedly occurred in the South China Sea. The most recent satellite image from Planet Labs of Apra Harbor, which was taken yesterday and that The War Zone has reviewed, appears to show the submarine still pierside in the same place it had been for weeks. However, the timestamp on that image says that it was shot before the first social media reports emerged suggesting that the boat had left port. “USS Connecticut has been undergoing damage assessment, repairs, and testing while in Guam. The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition,” Navy Cdr. Cindy Fields, a spokesperson for Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, or SUBPAC, told The War Zone . She could not comment on whether or not the submarine had put to sea for any reason. The Navy has consistently said that Connecticut ‘s nuclear reactor and the rest of its propulsion system were not damaged in the accident. It remains unclear just how serious the collision with the seamount was for the boat, with satellite imagery suggesting that its front sonar dome might have been ripped off entirely as a result. Other reports have said there was substantial damage to its ballast tanks and other parts of the underside of its hull. While we can’t say for sure, one definite possibility is that Connecticut is underway now off the coast of Guam, or at least had been for a time, to determine whether it can sail by itself to another base. This would be in line with Cdr. Fields’ statement that the Navy is still assessing the damage to the submarine, but that it has also been performing unspecified “repairs” and “testing” on the boat. The USS Connecticut is seen to the right in the background of this photograph, which was taken from the deck of the submarine tender USS Emory S. Land on Oct. 30, 2021. To date, this is the only official picture of any kind showing the submarine since the collision. , USN If the damage to Connecticut is as substantial as has been reported, it will need to be put into dry dock at some point. Apra Harbor does not have adequate facilities for this level of maintenance and the Navy has previously said the plan is to conduct more extensive repairs at the submarine’s homeport in Bremerton, Washington. If the boat can’t safely operate on the high seas, the service will have to hire a company to use a heavy lift ship to get it out of Guam. By every indication, at least at present, the Navy is still very committed to repairing Connecticut and returning it to service, no matter how costly or time-consuming it might be to do so. This makes sense, as The War Zone has noted in our previous reporting , given that this is one of just three Seawolf class submarines ever built . These are advanced and heavily in-demand assets that have significant intelligence-gathering capabilities and are employed to carry a variety of specialized missions. The last of the Seawolf class boats, the USS Jimmy Carter , is itself unique in that it has a 100-foot long Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) addition to its hull, among other changes, which reportedly enable it to conduct sensitive and potentially dangerous underwater espionage operations, as you can learn more about here . While the Navy is still sorting out exactly what to do with Connecticut , the service has initiated a plan to conduct refresher “navigational safety training” across its entire submarine force. A rare and now thoroughly dated picture, taken in 1997, of the main control room onboard USS Seawolf , showing sailors at the helm., USN Rear Adm. Jeffrey Jablon, head of SUBPAC, “and I have sent out today a joint message [about] having a navigational stand down,” Vice Adm. William Houston, who is Naval Submarine Forces Commander, as well as being in charge of Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (SUBLANT) and NATO’s Allied Submarine Command, said at the annual Naval Submarine League conference this week. “And we will have that and we will go ahead and learn our lessons. The safety investigation board is not complete yet, but we know enough right now.” On Nov. 4, the Navy had announced it had relieved Connecticut ‘s commanding officer, executive officer, and the chief of the boat, the last individual being the most senior enlisted member of the crew, over the underwater collision. These actions came after the service had “determined sound judgment, prudent decision-making and adherence to required procedures in navigation planning, watch team execution and risk management could have prevented the incident,” according to an official press release . No additional details about the incident were provided. “We have very rigorous navigation safety procedures and they fell short of what our standard was,” Vice Adm. Houston added at the Naval Submarine League gathering. With regard to Connecticut itself, it remains to be seen how close the submarine may be to leaving Guam to start what will be a long and meandering journey back to an operational state.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 21, 2022",Britain Wants America’s Help In The Race To Retrieve Its Crashed F-35 Off The Seafloor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the highly publicized loss of a British F-35B stealth fighter from the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in the eastern Mediterranean yesterday, the United Kingdom has approached the United States to help in the aircraft recovery effort. Retrieving the Lightning from the seafloor will be a high priority, to ensure that neither the jet nor any of its sophisticated components end up in the hands of Russia, or potentially other powers. You can read our initial report on the accident here . According to a report from Larisa Brown , Defense Editor of The Times , the U.K. Ministry of Defence has approached the United States for assistance since it has salvage equipment located in Spain, closest to the scene of the incident. An F-35B from No. 617 Squadron lands on the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in May 2021, ahead of Exercise Strike Warrior., Crown Copyright Unnamed Royal Navy sources told The Times that the precise location of the F-35B had not yet been determined, but the jet apparently crashed soon after takeoff from the carrier. Due to the characteristics of the jet, it could have moved a significant distance from where it actually entered the water. The hope is that Towed Pinger Locator 25 , or TPL-25, provided by the United States should be able to trace the F-35B’s emergency beacon and pinpoint its position. This equipment is apparently on its way to the area. According to the U.S. Navy, the 60-pound TPL-25 can locate downed military and commercial aircraft down to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet. It is towed behind a vessel at slow speeds, of up to 5 knots depending on the depth, picking up the acoustic signal from the aircraft’s pinger, transmitting it via a cable, and presenting it audibly to the operator. The Towed Pinger Locator (TPL-25)., U.S. Navy The same sources added that the jet will then be brought to the surface using a combination of remote-controlled undersea vehicles and inflatable bags that will be attached to it, providing buoyancy. At that point, it’s likely the F-35B would be loaded onboard a salvage vessel and brought to the shore, perhaps to Cyprus, home to a major RAF airbase . In the meantime, the U.K. military is reportedly keeping a close eye on the general area to ensure that no foreign nations attempt to locate or interfere with the jet. HMS Queen Elizabeth and another warship were noted earlier today apparently circling a location in the Mediterranean off the Greek island of Crete, although it’s possible they were conducting routine operations not connected to the recovery effort. An anonymous RAF source told The Times : “I’m sure the Russians would love to get their hands on an F-35. In terms of the practicalities of doing it, the logistics of it would be the same as it is for us.” However, The Times , again citing the Royal Navy, reports that the Russian Navy does not have “equipment capable of retrieving the wreckage […] in the nearby vicinity.” In addition, any such recovery effort, or underwater espionage, would clearly result in a major diplomatic incident if it were detected by the United Kingdom. Bringing a fighter jet up from the bottom of the ocean has been done before, on several notable occasions, but is far from easy, especially when it’s at a significant depth — reportedly, the F-35B is more than a mile below the surface. On the other hand, reports indicate the jet went down soon after takeoff, suggesting it was likely at a low energy state, meaning it is more likely to be intact. The British Lightning is not the first example of the Joint Strike Fighter to have crashed into the sea. While the British pilot of the F-35B — either a Royal Air Force or Royal Navy service member  — ejected safely, the pilot of a Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) F-35A was killed when the jet crashed off the northeast coast of Japan in April 2019. The wreckage of the Japanese jet was eventually found, but it took two months to find and recover the pilot’s remains . The jet’s flight data recorder was recovered but found to be damaged beyond use, and most of the jet remains submerged, at a secret location. However, some debris from the jet was noted floating near where the crash site. One of the aircraft’s tails was retrieved from the water by Japanese searchers not long after the crash. Even a small item of the jet could have provided a foreign power with a major intelligence coup, and the same goes for the British F-35B. In addition to the TPL-25, the search for the JASDF F-35A also made use of the Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle 21, or CURV-21 , a remotely operated vehicle used to survey the seabed. This can also operate down to 20,000 feet and carry a sonar and cameras to help locate objects of interest. It can be fitted with grabbing arms and other tools to manipulate or recover objects it finds. The U.S. Navy also deployed the CURV-21 in 2017 to help search for the submarine ARA San Juan after its tragic accident . The R/V Atlantis , a U.S. Navy-owned research vessel, deploys the Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle 21 (CURV-21) off the coast of Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina, to support the Argentine Navy’s search for the ARA San Juan ., U.S. Navy/LT Alex Cornell du Houx With the Japanese experience in mind, and especially the close proximity of a major Russian Navy presence at the Syrian port of Tartus , it seems every effort will be made not only to locate the British F-35B, but also raise it entirely. After all, the F-35B remains a potential security risk, packed with classified materials and sensitive manufacturing science that could yield valuable industrial intelligence. The Russian Navy, in particular, has an extensive fleet of special projects submarines capable of deep-sea work, including the possible ability to deploy its own manned and unmanned deeper-diving submersibles. In recent weeks, suspicion has fallen on one or more of these vessels having interfered with cables related to an undersea sensors network off the coast of northern Norway, an incident you can read more about here . Russia also operates the Yantar , a so-called oceanographic research vessel specially equipped to locate and recover wrecks — aircraft among them . In the meantime, of course, the U.K. Ministry of Defence is continuing its investigation into the accident to find out exactly why one of the country’s small fleet of fifth-generation fighters was lost in the final weeks of what had previously been a highly successful debut operational cruise for HMS Queen Elizabeth .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2021",Bureaucracy And Chaos Strangled The Military’s Response To The Capitol Riot,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A rally to protest the certification of the results of the 2020 Presidential Election and a subsequent riot on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, together remain one of the most significant and controversial chains of events in recent American history. Now, the Department of Defense’s Office of the Inspector General, or DODIG, has released a redacted report on the U.S. military’s initial preparations and response to the situation once the Capitol was breached. The redacted review concludes that, based on the information available at the time, the Department of Defense, as a whole, including the D.C. and other state National Guards, took appropriate steps within its authorities to prepare for contingencies and respond to the evolving situation. In addition, investigators found that there had been no deliberate actions by anyone within the Department of Defense to obstruct any of these activities. These assessments aside, the publicly released version of the report, despite redactions, plainly describes a situation hampered by bureaucracy and compounded by chaos after violence erupted at the Capitol Complex . Members of the DC National Guard at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021., AP Photo/Julio Cortez A total of 340 members of the D.C. National Guard were deployed into the city initially on Jan. 6. This was part of an approved plan to support D.C.’s Metro Police Department (MPD) as they bolstered their own presence to be prepared for any disturbances resulting from the election-related rally. Those personnel were spread out between 30 traffic-control points and six subway stations to provide additional security. A 42-person-strong Quick Reaction Force (QRF), equipped and prepared to carry out riot control duties, if required, was on standby at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Unlike national guards elsewhere across the United States, the D.C. National Guard has a more complex chain of command that goes through the Department of the Army to the Department of Defense, and then up to the President of the United States — then Donald Trump — who is its official Commander-in-Chief. This appears to have created numerous immediate hurdles to getting military support for civilian law enforcement personnel on Capitol Hill. A graphic showing the DC National Guard’s chain of command, and adjacent chains of command, all of which came into play during the events of Jan. 6., DODIG Just before 1:00 PM on Jan. 6, then-U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) Chief Steven Sund made his first request for National Guard assistance, via the Capitol Police Board. This followed skirmishing between his officers and large numbers of individuals who had marched on the Capitol after attending the rally. What happened between then and 1:49 PM, when Sund reached out directly to the D.C. National Guard commander, now-retired Army Maj. Gen. William Walker, for assistance, is not entirely clear. Ryan McCarthy, who was then Secretary of the Army, said he received a call at 1:34 from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asking him whether the USCP had asked for help. “Mr. McCarthy told us that it was clear to him the DoD needed to help either the MPD or the USCP,” according to DODIG’s report. After he got Sund’s phone call, Walker called Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, the Director of the Army Staff. “Hey, look. The Capitol is being breached. You can see it on TV. We need to get out there and help them,” Walker said he told Piatt. “We’ve got to go find the Secretary of the Army,” Piatt responded. It’s unclear when exactly they were able to find McCarthy, but it is clear that, due to the existing approved plan, neither he nor Gen. Walker could retask elements of the D.C. National Guard without approval from Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Miller says he first became aware of the situation from a television in his office. “As events escalated at the Capitol, the DoD Executive Secretary moved into Mr. Miller’s office. Throughout the day, Mr. Miller exchanged telephone calls with the Vice President, Members of Congress, Cabinet members, and members of the White House staff,” according to DODIG’s report. “Mr. Miller and GEN Milley [U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] both told us that there were no calls between the President and Mr. Miller.” The D.C. National Guard commander on the ground in the city also only became aware of the situation from the news and as MPD officers began to leave to leave their shared posts at the TCPs and subway stations to head to the Capitol. That individual, who is only referred to as the Task Force Guardian Commander in the report, ordered the QRF at Andrews to get ready to move, expecting the order to come down quickly. They also gathered up all the personnel from the TCPs and the subway stations for the same reason. Gen. Walker has previously testified before Congress that he could have had 150 people at the Capitol within 20 minutes had he been authorized to send them immediately, something witnesses DODIG interviewed disputed based on the simple timelines necessary to get things approved. USCP says that the first actual breach of the Capitol building occurred at around 2:15 PM. Seven minutes later, a conference call that included Secretary McCarthy, Mayor Bowser, Chief Sund, and others began. “Mr. McCarthy was on the conference call when it started, but did not remain present for the duration of the call,” DODIG’s investigators found. “Witnesses told us that Mr. McCarthy stayed on the call for approximately 5 minutes, long enough to hear and acknowledge the urgent request from Mr. Sund and Mayor Bowser.” “LTG Piatt told us that it was not the ‘clearest’ conference call because some participants were nearly panicked,” the report adds. “He said that people talked over each other, there was ‘yelling and screaming and shouting,’ other people were moving in and out of Mr. McCarthy’s office, simultaneous conversations were occurring, the news was on the television, and background noise was heard on some of the participants’ telephones.” “One of these witnesses said that no one on the conference call could answer LTG Piatt’s questions and the only thing LTG Piatt and the witness heard were ‘hysterical cries for help,'” it continues. Capitol Police in front of the Capitol on Jan. 6., AP Photo/Julio Cortez In the chaos, the D.C. National Guard QRF moved from Andrews to its Armory in D.C., closer to the Capitol. There is confusion about who ordered this, with Piatt saying McCarthy instructed Walker to do so, and Walker saying he did it “without permission.” In any case, none of the parties appear to have had the actual authority to approve this movement. There was also no approved operational plan for what the QRF would be supposed to do once approval was given for them to go to the Capitol. “LTG Piatt told us that he commanded a division in Iraq and could not imagine sending a subordinate element into a violent situation without that element clearly understanding the mission,” DODIG’s report says. “LTG Piatt added, ‘It would be like me saying, ‘Go to Baghdad and just find somebody and see what they need.”” At the time, Sund reportedly viewed Piatt’s hesitance as a denial of his initial request for support. Walker and other witnesses told DODIG that Piatt, as well as Army Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn, then the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and brother to controversial retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, had also raised concerns about the “optics” of rushing troops to the Capitol. This was, in part, prompted by the separate controversy over National Guard involvement in the responses to civil disturbances in the city in 2020. “MG Walker said that he was ‘stunned’ and ‘frustrated’ at these comments,” the report says. Piatt’s position is that he only wanted to make sure that things were done properly. “LTG Piatt explained that DCNG personnel were not armed or equipped for riot control and if the DCNG reported immediately, as requested, the USCP would only get ‘a bunch of bodies that [would] be able to reinforce the perimeter’ but would not be equipped or prepared to conduct building clearance operations,” DODIG’s report says. The report also notes that some personnel in the QRF were not actually trained for riot control duties and that basic rehearsals for what they might be called upon to do had been conducted earlier in the day at Andrews. This conference call ultimately ended abruptly at 2:45 PM as shots were fired at the Capitol. This would have been around when USCP officer Lieutenant Michael Byrd shot Ashli Babbitt as she made her way into the building. Bryd has since been cleared of any potential wrongdoing in his decision to use lethal force. “Whatever time that was that was like, ‘Okay. The National Guard is getting mobilized. We’re going big. It’s now — it now has triggered that worst-case scenario,'” Miller told DODIG’s investigators. He authorized the deployment of 1,100 D.C. National Guard personnel at 3:04 PM. Calls also began being made to National Guards in neighboring states to coordinate possible support. It seems clear that the need to plan, properly equip and transport personnel, and coordinate those deployments with law enforcement, together with various bureaucratic requirements, stymied the response. USCP Chief Sund only called General Walker at 3:26 to walk through the process of submitting a formal written request for support, more than two hours after his initial request for help through the Capitol Police Board. At 3:48 PM, Secretary McCarthy also left the Pentagon to physically go to MPD headquarters in D.C. to try to better coordinate things in person. “Mr. McCarthy told us his staff was trying to get situational awareness but it was clear there was a lot of confusion. He said individuals on the conference call were talking past each other so he made the decision to go to MPD headquarters, coordinate directly with D.C. officials, and get some assets to the Capitol as quickly as possible,” DODIG’s report explains. At that point, the entire situation seems to have been in total chaos, as is described in the following passage: An Army witness told us that MG Walker could not clearly articulate to his staff what the USCP specifically needed. The witness said this is what prompted Mr. McCarthy and his staff to go to MPD HQ to figure out what was actually happening at the Capitol and what the USCP needed. Another witness told us that MG Walker and his staff “were unable to tell Secretary McCarthy any details about where they [DCNG] were going, what they were doing,” which was why Mr. McCarthy went to MPD HQ to do the planning. The witness said that the DCNG, including MG Walker and two DCNG liaison officers at MPD HQ, provided no meaningful input to Mr. McCarthy or did not produce a plan that set the conditions to deploy to the Capitol other than to say they were ready to go. Per DODIG’s review, USCP Sund did not finally get his formal request for D.C. National Guard support sent until 4:07 PM. He also did not ask for help from the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, with which USCP has a standing mutual assistance arrangement, until 4:13 PM. With all of this and a plan finally in hand, the D.C. National Guard’s officially received its new mission at 4:35 PM. “[Army Chief of Staff General] GEN McConville said that at approximately 5:05 p.m., he asked MG Walker … if he ‘had authority to go [to the Capitol],’ and MG Walker replied, ‘Yep. What do you want me to do?'” DODIG report says. “GEN McConville said that he advised MG Walker that the best thing to do would be to ‘Go command. Go do the right thing, the right way, get out there and do what you need to do.'” The first guardsmen, the members of the QRF, did not arrive at the Capitol building until between 5:20 and 5:30 PM, after initially getting lost in the parking lot. By that point, it was more than four hours after USCP made its first request for support and even longer since the violence had erupted, which had quickly overwhelmed law enforcement officers on the scene. Members of the DC National Guard arrive at the Capitol on Jan. 6., AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Even then, the National Guard personnel had to be formally deputized to carry out law enforcement missions in the Capitol Complex, a swearing-in process that only started at 5:40 PM. Guardsmen only began to take up their positions at 6:00 PM. Other federal law enforcement personnel had also begun to arrive in the interim. At 7:03 PM, just a little over an hour after National Guard forces actually took up their posts, the Capitol building’s interior and immediate outside were declared completely “clear of demonstrators.” Personnel from the Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware National Guards, despite efforts to coordinate their deployment hours before and earlier public statements from some state officials that they were ready to go, did not get approval to enter the city until 11:27 PM. This was more than five hours after the inciting incident had effectively ended. With all this information in hand, even with its overall assessments, DODIG’s report does, obviously, recommend streamlining the chain of command for the D.C. National Guard, as well as improving the mechanisms for communication, planning, and training ahead of and during future events that could spiral into major civil disturbances. Members of Congress have already moved to make changes to the structure and posture of the D.C. National Guard to try to be better positioned to react to similar crises in the future. Many questions do certainly remain as to why various parts of the process took so long to move forward, though again, they were clearly compounded by bureaucratic demands and just how chaotic and fast-moving the situation was initially. At the same time, this does not seem to fully explain why coordination initially was so haphazard, with various senior U.S. military officials being alerted to how dangerous the situation was becoming the same way the rest of us were – through media reporting at the time. The report also indicates that many of the same issues were present in the responses by the U.S. Capitol Police, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice, but, of course, a detailed investigation into their actions is outside of DODIG’s remit. All told, it is clear that much remains to be learned about what happened on this fateful day at the Capitol, but hopefully lessons learned are already being put into place.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Otto Aviation says it has finished the first phase of testing its potentially revolutionary high-efficiency Celera 500L aircraft, which the company officially unveiled last year . The prototype has now flown approximately 51 flight hours across 55 individual sorties, including at speeds over 250 miles per hour and at altitudes up to 15,000 feet, the company said in a press release today. The War Zone was the first to report on the existence of this plane , with its distinctive tear-drop shape and pusher-propeller configuration, after a picture of it at the Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville, California emerged in 2017. We have been tracking its development very closely since then. The video below is a collection of footage Otto Aviation has released from its Phase One testing of the Celera 500L. “The data from our first phase of test flights shows that we are on the path to achieving our goals for the aircraft,” William Otto Jr., CEO of Otto Aviation, said in a statement. “We couldn’t be more excited in this step toward our mission of having a production aircraft in 2025 and we look forward to beginning the next phase of development where we will take the aircraft to higher altitudes and higher speeds.” Otto and his company believe that the Celera 500L’s design, with its tear-drop “laminar flow”-optimized shape, long and slender wings, and high-efficiency multi-fuel piston engine, combined with a flight profile intended to make the best use of the plane’s features, will inaugurate a revolution in low-cost air travel. The firm’s website refers to this as the “air taxi model.” Otto Aviation capture “During test flights, the team was able to visualize the laminar flow state with a precision infrared camera mounted on a chase aircraft, quantifying extensive laminar flow capability on external surfaces,” today’s press release explained. “The team also tested wing and fuselage surfaces for laminar flow robustness and gathered additional test data supporting the development work for the production vehicle.” You can read more about the novel features of this plane and its Raikhlin Aircraft Engine Developments (RED) A03 V12 piston engine in detail here . “Several flights reached airspeeds of over 250 mph at altitudes up to 15,000 feet which projects to an airspeed of 460 mph at 50,000 feet,” Otto Aviation release said. In the past, the company has said it hopes the aircraft will have a range of at least 4,500 miles and be able to get between 18 and 25 miles per gallon of fuel. Its target cost per flight hour is just $328, a fraction of the cost of flying comparably sized turboprop aircraft or business jets. An infographic comparing the projected performance and fuel economy of the Celera 500L to a similarly sized business jet., Otto Aviation “In the classic [turboprop] airplane world, you’re scrubbing for half-a-percent improvement here or there,” David Bogue, Otto Aviation’s Chief Technical Officer, who previously worked at Boeing on the 737-700, told Air & Space Magazine earlier this year. “With this aircraft here, we’re looking at a 400 percent improvement. It’s just fantastic!” The idea is that the high-efficiency design will make the aircraft more environmentally friendly. “Flight test results show the Celera 500L has already delivered emission reductions of 80% less than comparable aircraft,” a press release that Otto Aviation put out in December 2020 had said. Otto Aviation While the Celera 500L is still very much an experimental design, Otto Aviation already has already laid out plans for a larger Celera 1000L and has openly discussed potential cargo-carrying and military applications for its designs, the latter of which would be numerous. Its website talks about the potential for unmanned derivatives and versions with hybrid-electric propulsion. Replacing the cabin with fuel and sensors and taking out the crew, paired with its high flight ceiling and speed, it doesn’t take much creativity to see how the Celera concept could make a huge impact on the unmanned medium-to-high altitude, long-endurance drone marketplace. The company’s plan is still first to pursue a production version of the Celera 500L, which it is marketing primarily as an alternative to light turboprop passenger aircraft and business jets. An artist’s conception of a production version of the Celera 500L., Otto Aviation An artist’s conception of what the interior of a future production Celera 500L configured like a typical business jet might look like., Otto Aviation “We’ve got a 6’2″ cabin height, which allows you to walk onto the [Celera 500L] aeroplane. There’s a stand-up lavatory. It’s really on the same level as a mid-size business jet,” Otto himself told CNN for a piece published just last week. The aircraft’s overall look “may not appeal to the corporate executives flying in their Gulfstreams, but there’s a very large audience of people who are frustrated with commercial airlines, airport security, waiting in lines and how long it all takes.” It very much remains to be seen whether Otto Aviation will be able to meet its ambitious goals. There are some that say the company’s claims will be extremely challenging if not impossible to achieve. If it can, the Celera 500L, and future designs based on it, could easily be game-changing on a number of fronts. Otto Aviation Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 2, 2020",Secret RQ-180 “White Bat” Spy Drone Alluded To In New Air Force Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It seems like the drumbeat of news regarding the existence of the U.S. Air Force’s secret ‘RQ-180’ high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) flying-wing stealth drone is really picking up in tempo. After three sightings of such a craft, two over America’s premier flight test airspace in California and Nevada and another seemingly over the Phillippines , it seems like an official disclosure of the aircraft could potentially happen soon. Further evidence of this possibility comes directly from the Air Force’s Profession of Arms Center of Excellence (PACE). The video, titled “Heritage Today — ISR And Innovation,” gives a quick overview of how far the Air Force’s information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission has come over the decades. Toward the video’s end, it shows a Global Hawk flying and boldly states, “The days of balloons and biplanes have been replaced by white bats.” At this point, it cuts to a planform image of a stealthy flying-wing HALE drone — one of the semi-cranked-kite designs we have seen in HALE sensor craft studies that emerged in the 2000s and similar to notional art posted by Aviation Week when covering the clandestine RQ-180 program (keep in mind we still do not know its real designation). This is certainly a placeholder design, as they would not be showing off the real thing, which remains classified. Furthermore, it doesn’t match the planform of the aircraft we have seen in the air. That’s not to say that there is only one HALE stealthy flying-wing drone configuration flying these days, but that is another story. China is also pursuing a similar design under the CH-7 ‘Rainbow’ designation. Regardless, there is really no room for coincidence here. The “white bat” reference has no place in ISR parlance outside of the RQ-180. Not only does this fit the physical description of the stealth drone we have now seen repeatedly, but its own nickname and its associated unit iconography supposedly directly reference this. According to a report from Aviation Week , which has since been reinforced by additional sources, the aircraft’s nicknames, even if unofficial, are “Great White Bat” and “Shikaka.” Shikaka is the name of a fictional sacred white bat that is at the center of the plot of the 1995 Jim Carrey comedy Ace Ventura 2. More recently, Aviation Week reported that the Air Force had stood up the 74th Reconnaissance Squadron at Beale AFB, Calif., in 2019 to operate the RQ-180, at least remotely. This unit’s insignia features a large white bat that fits perfectly with the RQ-180’s reported nicknames. The 74th Reconnaissance Squadron’s patch with the white bat displayed at its center. Also, note the Latin slogan that translates to “Access Is Allowed.” Pretty clever for a deep-penetrating ISR platform., Aviationgear.com So, what can we make of this? It’s quite stunning that such specific dialogue and imagery would be inserted into an official video in this way. Really, it is the closest thing we have to actual confirmation of what is bound to represent a major revolution in airborne ISR as well as battlefield communications and networking. You can read all about that in our massive feature on just what this platform is likely to bring to the table. It is impossible to predict when the USAF will finally openly discuss its stealthy flying-wing HALE drone program, but this system is related to the B-21 Raider and the ecosystem of penetrating capabilities also being developed around it. With the B-21’s unveiling not too far off into the future, we could get some sort of acknowledgment that this aircraft exists around that same time. Then again, it could come even sooner, or far later on, once the aircraft and its underlying support infrastructure are fully operational. This may still be years away, long after the aircraft is flying real-world missions. We saw a similar developmental path for the Global Hawk, which we know this aircraft will at least partially replace . Still, the Air Force is now clearly laying big breadcrumbs as to the existence of the “white bat.” This is not done without reason. As the operations of this aircraft expand, it will become harder to hide it from the public anyway, especially considering its long-endurance capabilities, so some sort of disclosure may become a necessity in the near future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The highly anticipated Top Gun: Maverick movie has been delayed so many times now that it’s hard to remember that its release date was pushed back by months even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. While we can only hope that it will finally reach theaters next May , we can now share a group of documents that show just how closely involved the Department of Defense, including the Department of the Navy, really was in the production of the film. The War Zone obtained the official production assistance agreements, 84 pages in total, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. They are all dated between 2018 and 2019, but cover activities scheduled to run over into 2020. The documents, which reveal that the movie was referred to as “Island Plaza” during production, a common tactic used to help keep work on films under wraps and away from the prying eyes of fans and the paparazzi, are almost entirely unredacted. Certain names, initials, and signatures are the only things blacked out. These documents offer an immense amount of detail about the kinds of support the U.S. military can provide to approved film productions, but especially the Top Gun sequel. The original film resulted in a massive recruitment leap for the Navy, one that lasted years after it first hit theaters. It has been known that the sequel would be getting unprecedented Department of Defense support. These agreements detail exactly what the Navy did for the Paramount production. Some of the more interesting parts of these documents detail the exact responsibilities of both the Department of Defense and Paramount with regards to various aspects of the production, including changes to the script, payment for damages to the government, and reimbursement for certain work. The U.S. military also wouldn’t be liable for “unforeseen contingencies affecting national security or other emergency circumstances such as disaster relief [that] may temporarily or permanently preclude the use of military resources.” You can see some of these provisions below. DOD DOD DOD Not surprisingly, a significant number of the total pages in the FOIA release cover various government-provided assets and other services, as well as access to several bases for filming. The documents confirm that filming was conducted on location at Naval Base Coronado , Naval Air Station (NAS) Fallon, NAS Lemoore, Naval Air Facility (NAF) El Centro , Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake , and Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island . Fallon is home to the Navy’s real-life Topgun program . The Nimitz class aircraft carriers USS Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt were also made available. Some filming even took place inside Roosevelt ‘s Combat Direction Center, which is the ship’s nerve center . A section of one of the agreements that mentions filming inside USS Theodore Roosevelt ‘s combat direction center, slightly misspelled here as “combat directional center,” among other things., DOD There are actually only a few references to the F-14 Tomcat, an aircraft that is inseparable from the original Top Gun film that came out in 1986, in these agreements. In late 2018, The War Zone reported on pictures that had appeared online showing star Tom Cruise, among others, filming with an F-14. In early 2019, additional photographs of this aircraft actually on board the Theodore Roosevelt emerged, which we reported on , as well. “Subject to approval from Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) and The National Naval Aviation Museum ‘s [sic] (NNAM) authorize the production company to borrow one heritage F-14 Tomcat , repaint the aircraft with NNAM approved paint scheme, remove ejection seats for on-stage filming, and conduct maintenance to power aircraft to have control panel and exterior lights operational in support of filming onboard a CVN and at second location TBD,” a section of one of the documents says. “All costs related to transporting, painting and maintenance are the Production Company’s sole expense.” Another section confirms that a scene involving an F-14 crashing on the carrier’s deck is in the film. Back in 2019, as The War Zone reported , photos had emerged that showed the Tomcat being used for the movie positioned on the deck of the Theodore Roosevelt to look like it had gotten caught in the ship’s crash barricade. Part of one of the agreements that makes reference to the “F-14 crash” in the film., DOD Two different agreements say that the Navy was expected to provide between four and 12 actual F/A-18 fighters for film, “dependent on availability of aircraft.” There is at least one scene in the trailers that have been released so far showing a row of these jets, including one wearing a special paint job created specifically for the movie. In addition, the Navy was to “allow for the internal and external placement of the Production Company’s cameras on F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets and Navy helicopters with the approval of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).” As The War Zone has pointed out in the past , there is no two-seat version of the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which would have made filming actors inside one of those jets during flying sequences impossible on a basic practical level. The production agreements highlight security concerns, as well, when discussing the filming of stock footage of F-35s, along with F/A-18E/Fs, on the Abraham Lincoln . “F-35 Joint Program Office will have on-sight program manager to conduct security review of all F-35 footage onboard. Any footage deemed classified or sensitive will be deleted or turned over to the U.S. Navy prior to debarking the ship,” a section of one agreement notes. Security concerns regarding the filming of F-35 jets on the USS Abraham Lincoln are discussed here, among other things., DOD The Navy had to agree to allow various civilian aircraft, some of which are listed below, onto its bases for the movie. These included specially configured L-39 CineJets and an Embraer Phenom 300 business jet used for aerial filming, arrangements that are detailed in various agreements. Among other aircraft, the documents mention the P-51 Mustang seen in the trailers. This aircraft is confirmed to be a P-51K with the U.S. civil registration code N51EW that is owned and flown by star Tom Cruise himself through a company called Valhalla Aviation. DOD DOD There’s a brief mention of the fictitious Dark Star hypersonic aircraft that drew a significant amount of attention after the second trailer for the movie was released in 2019. The same section that mentions this name, seen below, also talks about some of the flight work that was done for the movie, including the filming of the actors in actual jets during basic flight maneuvers (BFM), dogfighting, low-level flight, and an “End Battle,” as well as other scenes. DOD There are some details about set construction in various locations, including the complete transformation of a hangar and squadron spaces belonging to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 30 (VRC-30) at NAS North Island , part of Naval Base Coronado, for the movie. VRC-30 flies the C-2A Greyhound Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) cargo aircraft and is set to eventually be inactivated as part of the Navy’s transition to the CMV-22B Osprey tiltrotor. The service’s first CMV-22B unit, Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron 30 (VRM-30), stood up at NAS North Island in 2018. A production schedule talking about the use of VRC-30 spaces for filming., DOD There are multiple discussions about building the “Hard Deck Bar,” a full stand-alone structure that was built on a beach at NAS North Island back in 2018. Curiously, the Navy had agreed to keep the building in place through September 2020, according to one of the agreements, despite the movie’s release date at that time being June 26, 2020. A separate agreement makes clear that structure would only be used for filming and not for any other purpose, such as public relations events to promote the film. DOD DOD Oh, and don’t forget that the Department of Defense is supposed to receive “a minimum of five one-sheets [movie posters] upon the date of the United States theatrical release of the Picture, and ten digital videodisc (DVD) copies of the completed production to DoD for internal briefings and for historical purposes, at such time when such materials are made available to the general public.” DOD These are just a few of the massive cache of details found in the production assistance agreements we obtained, which you can find in their entirety here . We encourage anyone to drop anything else they find of interest into the comments below. Top Gun: Maverick is currently scheduled to hit theaters on May 27, 2022. Hopefully, there won’t be any more delays.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 23, 2020",Unwanted British Sentinel Radar Planes To Be Picked Up By US Army: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom’s fleet of now-retired Sentinel R1 radar planes may get another lease on life in the United States, potentially with the U.S. Army. The five aircraft, based on the Bombardier Global Express business jet airframe, were finally retired earlier this year and were understood to have been offered for sale as spare parts. The War Zone argued in the past that the Sentinels could provide the U.S. Air Force with a nearly off-the-shelf augmentation of the tired E-8C JSTARS fleet, but these capable jets could also be of interest to the Army as it continues to enhance its fixed-wing surveillance capacity . Citing an unnamed source on the team charged with scrapping the Sentinels, the U.K. Defence Journal (UKDJ) website today reported that the aircraft would be made airworthy again and flown to the United States. A deal has apparently been struck between the U.K. Ministry of Defense and a joint Raytheon/Bombardier team and, according to the same industry source, the end-user is the U.S. Army. The Royal Air Force officially disbands the Sentinel R1 operator, No V (Army Cooperation) Squadron, at RAF Waddington on March 31 this year, after the withdrawal of the aircraft from RAF service., Crown Copyright “Work has started to make them serviceable for flight already,” the industry source told the UKDJ . “Just enough to get them over the pond. Nothing to do with the mission side.” That would tally with reports that work was already well underway to remove the mission systems from the aircraft. Among other things, the Sentinels carried the Airborne Stand-Off Radar, or ASTOR, which was developed and supported by Raytheon . ASTOR was capable of being used to produce highly detailed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, as well as track moving targets on the ground and at sea, as you can more about here . Provided that the five aircraft — or a portion of the fleet — is delivered to the United States in a stripped-down condition, then the bizjet platforms could be adapted for a wide range of possible missions. The Bombardier Global Express airframe was originally selected as the basis for the Sentinel on account of its high-altitude performance, long-range capabilities, and expansive interior, all of which would lend it to other standoff surveillance missions. What’s unclear is how the reported transfer of the Sentinel fleet fits in with the U.K. MoD’s previous statement that the aircraft would only be offered in the form of spare parts and were “not for reuse.” Perhaps, providing the aircraft in a fully stripped-down condition is enough to circumvent this, but it would also not be a surprise if this guideline had been bent to accommodate the sale of these aircraft to a close ally. After all, in recent years, deals have been struck to transfer examples of the C-130J transport and E-3D radar plane from the United Kingdom to the United States. The Sentinels, which were officially retired in February, only entered service in 2007. As early as 2010, there was discussion about divesting them, despite proving their worth in support of various combat operations around the world. Originally the plan was to remove them from service in 2018, but demands for their help from commanders in the field pushed that schedule back, with the type ultimately seeing service in Iraq, Libya, Mali, and Syria. The U.K. MoD justified disposal of the Sentinel on account of “obsolescence” and the cost that would be required to keep it reliable in the long term. Regardless of the long-term viability of its capabilities, it was the victim of being a niche asset within an air force that has been exposed to repeated and significant cutbacks, withdrawing entire aircraft fleets at a stroke. Despite not receiving planned major upgrades as a result of the retirement plan, the aircraft still have a lot of life left in them. In the past, The War Zone made the case for the Sentinel as a stopgap solution to the U.S. Air Force’s requirement for a JSTARS successor, but the competition to replace this aircraft was effectively abandoned in 2018. Instead, the service is pursuing a system-of-systems approach to replacing JSTARS under its Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) initiative . Airmen with the 12th Airborne Command and Control Squadron perform pre-flight ops checks on an E-8C JSTARS in preparation for a mission during a combat exercise at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia., U.S. Air National Guard/Senior Master Sgt. Roger Parsons Now, it seems possible that the U.S. Army, not the Air Force, will be the recipient of the ex-RAF Sentinels, although the USAF is still known to want to increase its fleet of E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) airborne communications platforms, another aircraft based on the Global Express airframe. It may also be looking for a spare parts source to support a larger E-11 fleet. However, this program has Northrop Grumman as its prime contractor, not Raytheon, so this seems less likely. Wherever they ultimately end up, the aircraft’s various satcom domes and other fairings could potenially be reused, saving on costly new modifications that would otherwise need to be developed and flight-tested for a special missions platform. A BACN-equipped E-11A aircraft at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in July 2018. , U.S. Air Force/Mark Herlihy As for the Army, the service has already been using two modified, contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 600/650 business jets configured as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms for testing and evaluation purposes. These testbeds, known as the Airborne Reconnaissance and Targeting Multi-Mission Intelligence System, or ARTEMIS , have been deployed for field tests in Europe and the Pacific . One of the contractor-owned and operated Bombardier Challenger 650 aircraft used to carry the ARTEMIS suite., U.S. ARMY Raytheon, the company now reportedly looking to buy at least some of the retired Sentinels, along with L3Harris is working on prototypes of a key payload, known as the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System, or HADES, that will go into a future Army ISR aircraft. Though ARTEMIS is using a business jet airframe, the service has yet to decide if this is its actual preferred platform. It is also considering the possibility of using an airliner-sized aircraft or a high-flying drone. According to Aviation Week’s Steve Trimble, the timeline for HADES might involve introducing a fleet of “fewer than 10 business jet derivatives,” followed by the introduction of a definitive solution in around 2035. What platform carries this sensor system is expected to replace the aging RC-12 Guardrail , as well as the more modern MC-12 Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), both of which are derived from the popular Beechcraft King Air series of twin-turboprops. It is possible that these future aircraft could be a replacement for the Army’s larger RO-6A Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E) aircraft, which are adapted Dash 8 twin-turboprops, as well. The MC-12 Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS)., U.S. ARMY HADES is expected to be capable of being deployed to hotspots around the globe, remain on station longer, then gather intelligence at longer standoff ranges and from high altitudes, increasing the amount of data it can acquire as well as improving its survivability. Alongside ARTEMIS and its evolving plans for HADES, the Army is preparing to use an adapted Global Express airframe as another ISR trials platform. This is the Airborne Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare System, or ARES, and it’s been installed on the bizjet by L3Harris Technologies. The aircraft reportedly made its first flight earlier this year. Again, we don’t know that the ex-RAF Sentinels are going to end up in U.S. Army service, but it’s clear that this service is increasingly aspiring to operate larger, more capable, and jet-powered ISR aircraft, which could include types in this class. Indeed, the kinds of platforms and capabilities that the Army is eyeing for HADES, at least, parallel those that the Air Force was considering for its abortive JSTARS replacement effort. At the same time, HADES is expected to offer some combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground-moving-target-indicator (GMTI) functions that are currently found on the E-8C, and which were previously found on the Sentinel R1. It’s too early to say whether the U.K.’s unwanted Sentinels finally fill a piece of America’s vast ISR puzzle. However, it’s fairly obvious that these airframes would be a good basis — and presumably a well-priced one — for any one of a number of aerial surveillance programs that are now beginning to take shape.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",HMS Queen Elizabeth Is First British Carrier To Send Jets Into Combat In Over Two Decades (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Royal Navy’s flagship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , has launched its first combat missions, as part of the international coalition fighting ISIS in the Middle East. British and American F-35B Lightning stealth jets operating from its deck in the eastern Mediterranean have flown operational sorties over Iraq during the warship’s first operational cruise as part of Carrier Strike Group 21 , or CSG21. Official confirmation of the F-35B combat sorties came from the Royal Navy today , although some sources reported that HMS Queen Elizabeth and its embarked air wing actually began flying missions against ISIS in Iraq on June 18, a date that’s also reflected in official Royal Navy imagery releases. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph stated that the jets first went into combat from the carrier last Sunday, June 20. So far, the U.K. Ministry of Defense has not disclosed if any weapons were employed by the jets, although unnamed defense officials confirmed to USNI News today that airstrikes had been flown. An F-35B Lightning from the RAF’s No 617 Squadron launching from HMS Queen Elizabeth for its first combat mission, in a photo dated June 18., Crown Copyright Either way, this is the first time that a Royal Navy warship embarking fixed-wing aircraft has taken part in combat operations since the much smaller Invincible class carrier HMS Illustrious took part in the U.K. response to the crisis in Sierra Leone in 2000. The last time that fixed-wing jets from a British carrier actually struck enemy targets was during the crisis in the Balkans in the mid-1990s when Sea Harriers were involved. Eight of the F-35Bs on the carrier are provided by the RAF’s No 617 Squadron, the “ Dambusters ,” while another 10 are from the U.S. Marines Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “ Wake Island Avengers ,” home-based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona, but currently under British command . The anti-ISIS missions have involved the Marine Corps jets, too. According to the British Ministry of Defense, this marks the first time that U.S. aircraft have launched into combat from a foreign aircraft carrier since 1943 when they flew from HMS Victorious in the South Pacific. As for the rest of CSG21, as well as HMS Queen Elizabeth , the Royal Navy elements of the strike group consist of the Type 45 destroyers HMS Diamond and HMS Defender , the Type 23 class frigates HMS Kent and HMS Richmond , the replenishment tanker RFA Tidespring , the stores ship and fleet tanker RFA Fort Victoria , and an undisclosed Royal Navy Astute class nuclear attack submarine. They are also accompanied by the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS The Sullivans , and the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Evertsen . “The ability to operate from the sea with the most advanced fighter jets ever created is a significant moment in our history, offering reassurance to our allies and demonstrating the U.K.’s formidable air power to our adversaries,” said U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. “The Carrier Strike Group is a physical embodiment of Global Britain and a show of international military strength that will deter anyone who seeks to undermine global security.” Two Royal Air Force F-35Bs armed with ASRAAM missiles for self-defense conduct a sortie in support of Operation Shader., Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Unconfirmed open-source flight-tracking data from yesterday suggested that the F-35Bs were also conducting these missions with support from both Royal Air Force (RAF) E-3D Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft operating from the RAF’s base at Akrotiri in Cyprus, also in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as RAF RC-135W Rivet Joint electronic surveillance aircraft flying from the United Kingdom. While AWACS is used primarily to monitor airspace movements, the Rivet Joint gathers and analyzes electronic emissions from communications, radar, and other systems. Further airborne early warning in the vicinity of the carrier itself will likely have been provided by the Crowsnest Merlin HM2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron, three of which are embarked on HMS Queen Elizabeth for what is the type’s first operational deployment. A Crowsnest Merlin HM2 helicopter on HMS Queen Elizabeth. , Crown Copyright Meanwhile, at least two RAF Voyager tankers were apparently available to provide aerial refueling to the F-35Bs last Sunday. These assets will have enabled the F-35Bs to remain on station longer, addressing a long-standing criticism over their range on internal fuel. The United Kingdom does not have any organic, carrier-based aerial refueling capacity. “At the moment, we’re taking on the lion’s share of that operation over Iraq, which is a fantastic […] feather in our cap. But an achievement that ‘A’, we’re trusted and ‘B’, that we’re able to do that,” Commodore Steve Moorhouse, the commander of the U.K. Carrier Strike Group, told reporters last Sunday. Commodore Moorhouse’s statement has been taken by some sources to indicate that the United Kingdom is currently bearing the brunt of the anti-ISIS mission in Iraq, while the U.S. military meanwhile focuses on its continuing withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Pentagon recently announced it would cut down the number of U.S. fighter squadrons — as well as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot missile defense systems — deployed in the Middle East as part of a wider effort to reduce its presence in the region. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright However, Moorhouse may well have been referring to the carrier-based F-35Bs taking over the mantle from RAF Typhoon fighter jets that are based at RAF Akrotiri. More generally, details of the types of missions that the F-35Bs flying from Queen Elizabeth have been undertaking have not been disclosed. Moorhouse did describe the Joint Strike Fighters as the “eyes and ears” in theater, thanks to its “hugely, hugely capable radar and sensor suite .” However, beyond the type’s basic electro-optical targeting capabilities, and synthetic aperture radar, it isn’t immediately clear what unique capabilities it can provide to commanders tasked with defeating ISIS on the ground. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright The debut appearance of the British carrier in the Mediterranean has prompted interest from Russia, which maintains a significant air and naval presence in Syria . Moorhouse noted that an unnamed Russian Navy warship had come within 16 miles of the carrier. A Russian Navy Admiral Grigorovich class frigate has been noted trailing CSG21 and the Royal Navy says Russian submarines are tracking their movements, too. According to the Daily Telegraph , the first F-35B combat mission last Sunday saw two jets tasked against ISIS, while another two were scrambled to investigate Russian aircraft overhead. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright “We’re rubbing up against Russian activity, not in […] a dangerous or aggressive manner, but you’ve just got other people out here playing in what is a fixed piece of water and airspace,” Moorhouse added, describing the eastern Mediterranean as more “congested and contested” as a result of the Russian presence in Syria. Meanwhile, British and Russian pilots have come within “visual distance” of each other, according to Captain James Blackmore, commander of the Carrier Air Wing aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth . “It’s that cat-and-mouse posturing, it’s what we expect in this region of the world. And as you can imagine, it’s the first time for F-35s into the eastern Mediterranean,” Blackmore explained. “So, of course, Russia wants to look at what they’re like, they want to look at what our carriers are like.” Crown Copyright Crown Copyright This planned combat deployment as part of the wider CSG21 cruise was announced by the U.K. government last month. “The F-35B Lightning jets pack a potent punch against Daesh and help prevent them from regaining a foothold in Iraq,” said U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey, in a statement released on May 3. “This is a prime example of the U.K. Armed Forces stepping forward with our allies to confront persistent threats around the world. It is Global Britain in action.” “This deployment represents the embodiment of the UK’s Joint Expeditionary Capability and utilizing the F-35Bs in the fight against Daesh will further demonstrate our commitment to securing their global defeat,” added Chief of Joint Operations, Vice Admiral Sir Ben Key. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright British-operated F-35Bs have previously taken part in combat missions over the Middle East, although from a land base. In the summer of 2019, as part of Operation Shader, the U.K.’s counter-ISIS campaign, the jets operated from RAF Akrotiri, a deployment you can read more about here . CSG21 is expected to remain in the Mediterranean for another two to three weeks before continuing its maiden operational deployment, which will take it via the Suez Canal before making planned visits to Oman, Singapore, India, Japan, and South Korea, as well as cooperation with the armed forces from those nations. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Until more details of exactly what kinds of combat missions the F-35Bs have been flying from the carrier become available, it’s hard to determine what impact they will have had on the campaign in Iraq. We don’t yet know how sustained this is, or what kinds of sortie generation rates have been achieved. When the planned combat missions were pre-announced, there was some concern that the effort might be a token one, but the switch in the focus of the U.S. military toward Afghanistan could have provided more opportunities for CSG21 to make a meaningful contribution. That there are still key ISIS targets in Iraq was demonstrated earlier this year, when RAF Typhoon fighter jets struck around 100 cave hideouts in a 10-day period, as well as launching Storm Shadow cruise missiles for the first time. A Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 armed with a conventionally armed Storm Shadow cruise missile at Akrotiri earlier this year., Crown Copyright However, even a fairly tokenistic effort would involve going through the motions of actually preparing aircraft on the ship for combat, launching them, and then recovering them under real-world conditions, and can only provide useful lessons learned for refining the tactics, techniques, and procedures for future operations from HMS Queen Elizabeth and sister vessel HMS Prince of Wales , which is now undergoing its first fixed-wing flight trials. The same learning curve applied to the entire strike group, which has been working to integrate to monitor for potential threats, like the Russian presence in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, bearing in mind the proximity of Russian forces, the F-35B’s availability as an information-gathering tool probably makes it a very useful asset in this theater, even if this kind of capability is not a prerequisite of anti-ISIS missions. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright What is noteworthy, however, is that even in a combat operation fairly close to the United Kingdom, and in a relatively benign environment, a significant role is clearly being played by land-based aircraft: the aforementioned AWACS and Rivet Joint for surveillance, plus Voyager tankers. A case could be made that very similar effects could be brought to bear by having F-35Bs flying missions from an airbase on Cyprus, as they did in 2019. Meanwhile, ensuring critical support assets are on hand is not such a problem in the Mediterranean, but could be a very different story in the Indo-Pacific region, for example, where aerial refueling support would be even more critical. Crown Copyright Crown Copyright Nevertheless, the United Kingdom has proven that HMS Queen Elizabeth , and the wider Carrier Strike Group, are ready for combat operations. That is an important messaging tool in itself and provides weight to the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s claim that the CSG21 is “committed to confronting persistent threats around the world and [will] make a meaningful contribution to global security.” More concretely, after more than two decades, the United Kingdom has returned to fixed-wing carrier-based combat operations, after having given up this capability entirely in 2010, with the decision to retire its last Harrier jump jets. Regenerating that capability has been a huge effort, and an extremely costly one, but the first of the country’s two aircraft carriers is now combat-proven. Although many details of the operation are still to be revealed, the United Kingdom’s first use of carrier-based combat airpower in a long time is significant in its own right. Update, 12:45 pm PST: Further details of these milestone combat sorties have been provided by the U.S. Marine Corps, confirming that “counter-ISIS and protective overwatch missions” were launched from HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Sixth Fleet area of operations on June 18, in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Accompanying photos show F-35Bs from VMFA-211 being armed with live munitions including GBU-12 Paveway guided bombs, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), AIM-120 AMRAAMs, and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",F-35 From The Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth Has Crashed Into The Sea (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has confirmed that an F-35B Lightning stealth jet that was operating from the Royal Navy’s flagship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth , currently underway in the eastern Mediterranean, crashed into the sea earlier today, soon after takeoff. Details are still limited, but the British pilot was able to eject safely and has been returned to the ship. The aircraft carrier is on its maiden operational cruise, and this is the first loss of a Joint Strike Fighter while operating from the deck of an aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship . The F-35B crashed during routine flying operations at approximately 10:00 AM U.K. time this morning, and no other aircraft were involved in the mishap. The U.K. Ministry of Defence has offered no additional details about the circumstances of the incident but has said that an investigation is now underway. A pair of British F-35Bs on the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Crown Copyright HMS Queen Elizabeth is back in the Mediterranean, having just recently transited north through the Suez Canal after having sailed to the Asia Pacific region as part of Carrier Strike Group 21 , or CSG21, earlier this year, during a 26,000-nautical-mile cruise that planned to take in visits to 40 nations, as well as various bilateral and multinational exercises. The preparations within the British Lightning Force, ahead of this major undertaking, are something that The War Zone discussed in detail with Group Captain Jim Beck, the Station Commander of RAF Marham, the home base of the U.K. F-35Bs. Prior to this mishap, the carrier had a contingent of eight F-35Bs from the Royal Air Force’s No. 617 Squadron, the “ Dambusters ,” onboard. These are embarked alongside 10 similar jets from the U.S. Marines Corps’ Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211, the “ Wake Island Avengers ,” based at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona, but currently under British command . As well as HMS Queen Elizabeth , the Royal Navy elements of CSG21 consist of the Type 45 destroyers HMS Diamond and Defender , the Type 23 class frigates HMS Kent and Richmond , the replenishment tanker RFA Tidespring , the fleet tanker RFA Fort Victoria , and an undisclosed Royal Navy Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarine. They are also accompanied by U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS The Sullivans , and the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigate HNLMS Evertsen . CSG21 had taken HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Mediterranean earlier this year as well, during which British F-35Bs launched their first combat missions, as part of the international coalition fighting ISIS in the Middle East. This was the first time that a Royal Navy warship embarking fixed-wing aircraft had taken part in combat operations since HMS Illustrious took part in the U.K. response to the crisis in Sierra Leone in 2000. The loss of any jet fighter is a significant blow, but in the case of the United Kingdom, in particular, F-35B fleet numbers and costs have long been a point of fierce debate. To date, the United Kingdom has committed to buying 48 Lightnings by the end of 2025, at a cost of £10.5 billion. As of this morning, 24 of the jets had been delivered to the RAF, the three most recent examples arriving at RAF Marham in England in October. Beyond that number, there has been a long-standing official target of 138 aircraft purchased across the lifespan of the program. However, the government has more recently admitted that the figure of 138 was taken “following some hesitation,” and most observers expect the number to be reduced , perhaps significantly. The U.K. government’s Integrated Review Command Paper , published earlier this year , did commit to increasing the F-35B fleet size beyond the 48 already ordered but didn’t provide any more details on numbers, and there is a tacit acknowledgment that the planned 138-aircraft figure has been abandoned. Overall, this is the fifth crash of an F-35, of all versions. The crash totals prior to this latest incident were two U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs, which we reported on here and here , one U.S. Air Force F-35A , and one Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35A . This tally does not include ground incidents, including engine fires and undercarriage failures on landing, for example. Update, 5:00 PM GMT: We now have apparent confirmation that the F-35B lost earlier today was indeed one of the eight embarked British jets, assigned to the Royal Air Force’s No. 617 Squadron and was not a U.S. Marine Corps jet flown by a British pilot. Paul D. Shinkman, the National Security Correspondent for US News , tweeted that the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office confirmed that the “pilot is British [and] was flying a British plane.” Update, 8:00 PM GMT: The Headquarters Marine Corps has also now confirmed that it was not a USMC jet that was lost and provided us with the following statement: “We are pleased to hear that the British pilot is safe and back aboard HMS Queen Elizabeth after ejecting from a U.K. F-35 over the Mediterranean. U.S. participation in the U.K.’s Carrier Strike Group 21 has allowed us to train with the U.K., improve readiness and interoperability, and respond to situations such as these.” Meanwhile, the @DefenceSenseUK notes that the mishap pilot was recovered by an embarked Merlin helicopter from the aircraft carrier. Among its rotary-wing component, HMS Queen Elizabeth currently embarks Commando Merlin helicopters from 845 Naval Air Squadron, as well as anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning Merlin HM2s from 820 Naval Air Squadron.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Among the maelstrom of operational and abandoned test sites that speckle the desolate desert on the southern end of White Sands Missile Range sits a peculiar facility that has quietly helped develop the Navy’s most important missile, gun, and fire control technologies for over six decades. The installation with a U.S. Navy ship’s name and culture, but located thousands of miles away from where a ship should be, has put weapon systems that would change warfare forever through their paces. This place is USS Desert Ship, also designated LLS-1, for ‘Land Locked Ship’ number one. It is also known by the adjacent launch site that predates it, Launch Center 35 (LC-35). LLS-1 is yet another exotic installation that makes up a constellation full of seemingly countless facilities arrayed across the United States that develop, test, and evaluate America’s future combat technologies. LLS-1 is half ship-like concrete bunker and half launch pad. Built in the mid-1950s at the dawn of the guided missile age, its blockhouse was designed to be stuffed with combat systems and to emulate the conditions found on an operational U.S. Navy fighting ship. Its upper deck was fortified to accommodate similar sensors and communications gear found on its seagoing counterparts as well as additional gear needed to support testing efforts and to interface with the highly networked and surveilled White Sands Missile Range complex which extends many miles to the North. The WSMR Complex area (marked in red) is about 8 miles to the west of USS Desert Ship., WSMR The facility was originally built to develop and test the massive and ultra-complex and optionally nuclear-armed RIM-8 Talos shipboard surface-to-air missile system. When I say complex and massive it is not for hyperbole’s sake. Read all about this crazy Cold War weapon whose combined magazine and launch system was more akin to a highly armored assembly line at sea than anything else in this recent feature of mine . The facility from the air, with what looks like a box launcher installed for Sea Sparrow missile tests. Also, note the large trapezoidal building with GO NAVY on the top is the Talon assembly-magazine area just like the ones found on ships (Left image). Talos tests had to very lively affairs back in the 1950s (Right)!, USN Eventually, the ‘Three Ts’ of the Navy’s SAM ecosystem during the first couple of decade of the Cold War—Terrier, Tartar, and Talos—would be tested at the facility, with all three launchers , including Talos’ missile assembly magazine, being installed in front and just to the east of USS Desert Ship. Gun systems were also tested at the site. A 73,000 pound, Mk39 five-inch gun was used primarily. Tests included the evaluation of rocket-propelled shells back in the 1990s before the gun was removed in 2000. Before any of this took place, back in 1947, a pad adjacent to where USS Desert Ship sits to today was constructed to launch Aerobee sounding rockets into the upper atmosphere. These rockets gathered important information on atmospheric conditions and cosmic radiation. Two big launch towers were used to send the Aerobees on their way. The name LC-35 comes from this precursor installation to USS Desert Ship. The large tilting launch rails used for Aerobee rockets at LC-35. These rockets could travel dozens of miles into the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere. , UC Boulder By the mid-1970s, the facility began to slowly migrate away from primarily supporting tests of the ‘Three Ts’ to the doing so for the Standard Missile series and the Aegis Combat System. A large portion of Aegis developmental testing was executed at the site leading up to and after its certification in 1983. Since then, USS Desert Ship has continued to support the development of the latest Navy missile technologies. White Sands Missile Range officially describes the site’s activities as such: Launch Complex 35, known as the USS Desert Ship LLS-1, is primarily used for live fire testing the Navy´s STANDARD Missile (SM). The Navy is currently testing SM and Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) at this site. All versions of STANDARD Missile have been tested at the Desert Ship including SM-2 Block II (Terrier, Tartar, AEGIS, and Vertical Launch AEGIS), SM-2 Block III/IIIA/IIIB (Terrier, Tartar, and Vertical Launch AEGIS), and SM-2 Block IV (Extended Range Vertical Launch AEGIS). Testing of SM-2 Blk IVA is in process. Other Navy systems that have been tested here include Sea Lance, NATO Seasparrow Missile (NSSM), and Vertical Launch ASROC (VLA). The Desert Ship functionally duplicates the fire control requirements of a surface ship. Dedicated telemetry, target monitoring, and data extraction and reduction systems Launch Complex 35 “The Desert Ship” complement the extensive instrumentation services provided by the Range… Launch Complex 35 is a Research Rocket facility that includes a block-house, launch control equipment, and a payload assembly building. Current use of this facility is for NASA payload buildup, telemetry pre-launch and launch support, and uplink control of rocket payloads. Some areas inside LLS-1 look a bit more like a NASA control center than the inside of a fighting ship, while others still supposedly appear similar to what you would see in a combat information center aboard a ship. And even though the facility is over 60 years old, it is still uniquely positioned to test the hardware that will end up on America’s front-line fighting ships in the not so distant future., USN More recently, in 2016, LLS-1 executed a highly publicized cooperative engagement test in which an F-35 provided targeting information to an SM-6. The facility continues to be an important part of moving improved versions of the hugely versatile SM-6 that feature new capabilities into an operational state, but gone are the eclectic turreted launchers of the past. A basic concept drawing of the cooperative engagement test over White Sands Missile Range in which an F-35 provided targeting data for a SM-6 fired from USS Desert Ship. , USN Today, an upright Mark 41 vertical launch system, similar to those used at Aegis Ashore sites overseas, provides the launch interface for missile tests. A relatively new site handles the launches remotely from USS Desert Ship. There is also a weapons assembly facility across the road from USS Desert Ship that provides munitions to be tested. It was built to make tests more seamless as transporting experimental weapons over long distances was deemed problematic, especially while trying to power through important trials. But by and large, there isn’t anything but a handful of other test sites within about 10 miles of USS Desert Ship, with the closest population center being the tiny town of White Sands that largely exists to support the missile range and its workforce. WSMR Even though only roughly 30 sailors work at the site, along with a number of contractors that can drastically increase or decrease depending on the testing schedule, it seems that some of those who have called the facility home actually enjoyed their time there. USS Desert Ship and LC-35., Google Earth A newer remote facility located roughly two and a half miles north of USS Desert Ship is equipped with the vertical launch systems needed to carry out missile tests in conjunction to USS Desert Ship for the Navy., Google Earth There are a handful of other ship-like structures built on land to help in naval combat systems research and development which we will discuss in a future article, but none are as remote or offer live fire opportunities like USS Desert Ship. It’s yet another oddity of the sprawling White Sands Missile Range—a place packed with history along with a sprinkling of mystery.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",Confessions Of A B-52 Stratofortress Maintainer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-52 Stratofortress is arguably one of the most iconic flying machines ever created. For the U.S. military, it is so much more than that. It serves as the backbone of the aerial leg of America’s nuclear deterrent triad and has morphed throughout the years to match the needs of the Air Force at the time. From standoff missile truck to close air support platform , the B-52 has done far more than its original creators could have ever dreamed it would do. It’s now set to soldier on at least into the back half of the century , taking on new roles as hypersonic missile truck — and who knows what else — in an upgraded form. The thing most don’t think about in regard to the B-52 is just how many generations of airmen have put blood, sweat, and tears into keeping it in the air day-in and day-out. With the youngest B-52H now hitting 60 years old, there were airmen scrambling to generate sorties on these same jets that called John F. Kennedy their Commander-in-Chief. The fact that they still fly so reliably — they are more dependable by a significant margin than their newer B-2 and B-1 brethren — is a testament to the guys and gals on flightlines and in hangars, putting in long hours to keep these ancient flying beasts motivated to complete their critical missions. They are the true unsung heroes of the B-52’s incredible story. For well over six decades, the B-52 force hasn’t slept. At any given time, some part of the sprawling ecosystem that keeps these aircraft in the air is churning somewhere. Crew chiefs and other ground support personnel have been the backbone of this incredible operation, which is truly a multigenerational institution now and is set to continue being so for decades to come., U.S. Air Force / Staff Sgt.

Enter John Brehman, who was a young kid from Chicago fresh out of high school when he enlisted just prior to the world-changing events of 9/11. He went on to serve until the middle of the decade that would be dominated by the Global War On Terror — a strategic shift that would see the B-52’s mission be revamped once again. Brehman was part of a long lineage of young Americans whose mission was to make the B-52 fly. For an aircraft that was already nearly a half-century old at the time, massive in proportions, and sporting eight turbofan engines , that is not an easy task, as we are about to find out. Below is our extensive Q and A, but before we start, I would check out this previous post that features a great tour of the B-52. It will make this piece a far richer read. What exactly does a B-52 crew chief’s job entail? Very generally, a crew chief is responsible for the general maintenance, inspections, and servicing, as well as launch and recovery, of their aircraft. Maintenance can mean everything from changing brakes to changing cockpit light bulbs; inspections from pre-flight to extensive tear-down in Phase; servicing from a 310,000 lb refuel to refilling liquid oxygen tanks. John hanging off one of the B-52’s loaded bomb racks. Courtesy of John Brehman B-52 Bomb Squadrons (BS) at Barksdale Air Force Base (96th, 20th, and 11th, and the 93rd Reservists) utilized a dedicated crew chief (DCC) system — usually, an E-5 or young E-6 is the DCC, with an E-4 as assistant DCC (ADCC) and a couple of E-3s or below also working that jet. Ideally, the same people work on the same jet for years, getting to intimately know the quirks and specific details of an individual plane. This is certainly true of the DCCs themselves, but maybe less true of the ADCCs. If your airplane is flying on a given day — maybe two to three times a week for a couple of weeks and then not again for a few weeks — generally the DCC and an E-3 will launch it, coming in eight hours before launch, which would usually be between 8 and 10 AM. The ADCC and the other E-1 recover it in the afternoon or evening. Training flights would often be eight or more hours long, I imagine to semi-simulate combat ops. On the many other non-flying days, you’re helping everyone else with their planes. There was rarely a shortage of work. John climbing alongside a load of AGM-86 CALCMs in the B-52’s bomb bay. Courtesy of John Brehman When I was there, the Air Force moved away from individual bomb squadrons having maintenance (MX) sections, and went with the more generic 2nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron for the 2nd Bomb Wing, but nothing really changed. The same MX personnel were still assigned to the same bomber squadron and the same planes. That, as with many other things, may have changed since 2005. As an aside, crew chiefs were “in charge” of MX, but many other specialists contributed every day to the airworthiness of a jet: hydraulics, electrics, avionics, life support, comms, engines. The list goes on. Unless there’s a scheduled task from a given section, we would be the ones to call those specialists, either via a crew request or because we found something amiss. What are the major differences between being a crew chief for a modern tactical jet, like an F-16, and a huge early Cold War-era strategic bomber like the B-52? I don’t really know the differences, but I would speculate that modern jets, like commercial jets, have fault sensors and can tell the mechanic what the issue is, or are small enough that one person can handle most tasks. Everything on the MX side of a B-52 is visual. You’re checking steam gauges and sight gauges in the wheel and flap wells for the six hydraulic systems. You’re putting a tire pressure gauge on 10 tires. You’re repositioning a stand eight times just to check the oil. Etc. Rarely did we work alone on a B-52. There was a lot to be done and it all took time. The names of the crew chiefs on one of Barksdale’s B-52s, including John’s. Courtesy of John Brehman How does one train to be a crew chief on a B-52? The training was actually pretty simple. I spent about two months at Sheppard AFB in Texas, mostly dealing with classroom safety instructions. They have a G-model there with the vertical stabilizer cut off so the Russian satellites know it’s not an active bomber, but I don’t think we touched it to do any practice maintenance. We just used the aircraft familiarity training. When I got to Barksdale AFB, of course, it was different. Like any job, you sort of jump into any situation you can, and get respect by being willing to do anything. I was also blessed with an outstanding supervisor (my DCC), who quizzed me randomly when we had time and was seen as one of the most knowledgeable guys on the flightline. The B-52 crew chief as a job is sort of a dead end. Either one cross-trains after six or so years, or they stay in Shreveport (or — God forbid — Minot) and likely become an expert on the aircraft. No old-timer knew everything, though. Every plane we had (built 1960 and 1961) was older than anyone working on it, and even the 20-plus year guys would be called out of the office here and there to see something new. From left, Airman Greg Hogle, Airman 1st Class Daniel Miranda, Airman George Michael Singer III, and Airman Brycen Brooks, 362nd Training Squadron B-52 crew chief apprentice course students, pose for a picture inside a B-52 Stratofortress at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. U.S. Air Force / Airman 1st Class Pedro Tenorio How does the crew chief on a B-52 interact with its flight crews and its maintainers? As a young buck back then, I didn’t interact too much with the crew, to my regret. I was focused on not screwing up. Those butterbars (new officers) and lieutenants who were training weren’t much older than me. They were the ones we’d see from the hangar bouncing ‘our’ aircraft on the runway doing touch-and-goes. We’d say, “It takes a college education to break a plane, and a high school education to fix it.” The DCC and more knowledgeable maintainers had a friendly relationship with the crew most often. The DCC, launching the aircraft, would usually know the aircraft commander, and there was a lot of implicit trust the crew gave us. I learned that later on, after I gained the knowledge and experience to be in charge of a launch myself. Most often, they ask any question and go with whatever you have to offer them. Airman 1st Class Alan Johnson and Airman 1st Class John Thompson, 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron weapons load crew members, walk under the bomb bay of a B-52H Stratofortress. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Brittany Y. Auld The youth of some of the training flight crews made for funny moments. I never saw it myself, but a young LT inspecting a leak in the bomb bay, inclined to touch and smell the liquid in question to determine the source, may have had crew chief piss on his fingers. Rarely was there an asshole crew member. Sometimes crew members would leave important items in the cockpit, like a headset or document case. The CC would keep it for them and often would be rewarded with a case of beer — a tradition. How reliable were the BUFFs (Big Ugly Fat Fuckers — or Fellows) when you were crew chief on them? We never said BUFFs, so that’s funny to hear. I loved my jet, “Balls Eleven,” the flagship of the 11th Bomber Squadron, so I didn’t consider it an ugly plane. Maybe that’s just me! Anyway, pretty darn reliable, I think. We had stats displayed on a physical board, updated weekly, driving into the Bossier City entrance of Barksdale with each bomber squadron’s recent reliability. I think most were around 85 percent-ish, albeit that’s stateside. Airman 1st Class Wesley Pratt, 20th Aircraft Maintenance Unit crew chief, inspects a B-52H Stratofortress during a series of inspections in support of Global Thunder 20 at Barksdale Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Tessa Corrick I know we were more reliable than B-2s by a bit and by B-1s by a good deal, for the most part. From what I remember, the Bone’s reliability was in the 60 percent a lot of the time. Sort goes to show why the Air Force is keeping the B-52 around. Walk us through a typical launch and recovery of a B-52. So, launch. As a crew chief, you’d get there eight hours prior — let’s say midnight, for an 8 AM flight. All the servicing should be done and good. The aircraft should be good to go. Fueled up. You’re not changing a tire at 2 in the morning, of course. So you’re going through the pre-flight checklist, which is extensive, but easy as long as nothing happens, which it likely wouldn’t — double-checking stuff for your own eyes, basically, so when you greet the flight crew you have absolute confidence in the jet. You’re running a flashlight over accumulator pressure gauges and hydro reservoir sight gauges, checking for leaks on the landing gear. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Jacob M. Thompson Hint: If you know your aircraft and know there’s a training crew that’s going to wonder why there’s a single drip of hydro fluid on the main landing gear strut, keep a rag on you and wipe it right before the crew van shows up. And, of course, know the exact drip limits allowed by the tech orders, so you can confidently tell this super-cautious new second lieutenant or this full-bird colonel getting out of the office for the first time in a month, “It’s within limits.” We work over the plane with flashlights and determine it’s fine. Time to transcribe forms, my least favorite activity. Maybe it’s electronic now. Hopefully, it is. Every fault that is found has to be written up. Every corrective action taken has to be written up, with the annotated tech order reference. Everything signed off can be set aside, taken out of the aircraft forms, which actually stay on the aircraft when it flies (again, maybe changed since 2005), but all the existent items have to be carried forward for the aircrew to review. It’s like office work. Now we’re ready, and we’re at the aircraft when the aircrew pulls up two hours before scheduled takeoff. We have things nice and tidy, which means everything from pushing the chocks a bit forward from the forward gear (there’s nothing more embarrassing than not being able to remove a chock when everything else is golden and engines are running, but there’s pressure on an offending chock), to having the ejection seat straps set off to the side so the crew can easily get in their seats. U.S. Air Force / Staff Sgt. James Cason We talk to the crew — they review the forms. They ask about outstanding discrepancies — we explain any issues. They go up the hatch after their individual outside inspections and get set up. We have an air cart and a generator hooked up to the aircraft — attached to the #2 pod, 3 and 4 engines — because the B-52 has no onboard auxiliary power unit (APU). There are two crew chiefs in the launching crew — one on a headset talking to the aircrew, the other to follow instructions. The generator is pretty much always running, but unlike an actual APU, our air cart doesn’t supply air conditioning. On super hot days, or if a VIP is flying, they’ll haul an enormous AC cart out to the jet and run the foot-diameter insulated tubes through the hatch or through the cockpit windows. The aircrew will start engines 3 and 4 off of the air cart we have. That means they have low-pressure air, one hydraulic system, and one generator online. Keep that in mind for cart starts. On the ground, the non-wired crew chief is in front just looking for anything abnormal. If it’s sorta crazy and only lasts for two to three seconds, it’s “normal.” You do not want to freak out flight crews by reporting flames that aren’t sustained. So the engines start normally, as they usually do, and that’s signaled to the crew by hand and also through the headset. Senior Airman Josh Serafin, 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief, monitors the ignition of eight B-52H Stratofortress engines at Minot Air Force Base, N.D. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman J.T. Armstrong They start the rest of the eight engines, and other vehicles, which have crew chiefs and have been watching us launch, swoop in to take away first the air cart and a bit later the generator. The crew cycle and check flight surfaces and close the bomb bay doors. The headset-wearing crew chief confirms these movements. If any crew member has issues with their equipment, the aircraft commander, in the pilot’s seat — also generally our point of contact on the headset — will request specialists or tell us what to do. Then comes the fun part, when they’re ready to go. There are two of us, so one wishes the crew well as they unplug from the intercom system in the wheel well. Each crew chief pulls a four-foot chock out of the way of the forward main landing gear, dragging it to the aft gear so it’s not a factor at all. Then we run out to our respective wings to make sure everything is clear. Remember that there are eight running engines and you’re running up the fuselage and away from the pilot’s view. Then we snap-to, give them a salute, and touch the wingtips as it taxis by. Launching a plane generally wasn’t hard work, but it was very rewarding if it was ‘your’ plane. Even if it wasn’t, one knew the work that went into getting a B-52 off the ground, and it was still a great feeling. A B-52H Stratofortress takes off from Barksdale Air Force Base, La., during Global Thunder 21. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Tessa B. Corrick Everyone swarmed a B-52 after a mission. For crew chiefs, the ADCC might ask the crew questions, maybe not. At this point, it’s the evening and everyone wants to get shit done: Swing shift (3 PM-ish to midnight-ish) wants to start work so they can end work. The aircrew has been doing a difficult job since their pre-flight briefings at 6 AM. Day shift sucks ass and is as lazy as possible. But yeah, all the servicing and MX generally happens soon after landing. A boost to your ego might happen if you find that, as you show a B-52 crew where to park their aircraft, you nail it with hand directions. That’s a nice feeling, to get it right immediately. First and foremost, after engine shutdown, you safe the ejection seats. You can’t work in an environment with unsafe ejection seats. These are not zero-zero (zero airspeed, zero altitude) ejection seats. In other words, they can’t save the crew safely without some forward speed and altitude. To punch out, you rotate and depress the handle, and the lip of the ejection hatch is exposed to the airstream. If there’s no airstream, or you’re in a lower compartment with little altitude, it’s over. U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Corri Craig, 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, flying crew chief, adjusts his headphone sound on a communication radio panel in a B-52H Stratofortress assigned to the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Xavier Navarro There’s also an actual rope kept in the cockpit — DO NOT grab the rope and jump! At least that advice was given to us in training. It’s one of those features that exist but probably has never been used. Anecdotally, we heard people have broken legs in their hurry to get out. The “escape route” was the no. 3 cockpit window, the only window that opens, or somehow climbing out of the hatch above the election seat by twisting torque tubes to release and then lift the hatch. After that, it’s your basic oil servicing, checking tires and brakes. And of course, then there is also the drag chute. It’s a huge part of the crew chief’s job. Every recovery involved reinstalling a drag chute. It’s a 200-ish pound parcel. It’s a key piece of the B-52 — the brakes are sturdy, but not meant to hold up for so long. Also, the aircraft is very heavy. Pilots pop the chute every time; it’s part of a normal landing. There’s a shop, of course, for re-packing chutes. So, part of the post-flight would be to re-install a drag chute. This would involve getting a drag chute stand, if one is available, and hauling it across the flightline. And it takes four-ish people to put the chute in and rig it and the drogue chute, which is a little spring-loaded canister attached to the cockpit via a cable that runs the length of the fuselage. There’s a winch on the drag chute stand to pull up the chute from the ground to get it into the tail, but usually, it was easier to haul the fucking thing up a bunch of steps from a different stand. Crew chiefs from the 20th Aircraft Maintenance Unit hoist a packaged drag chute for installation on a B-52 Stratofortress at Barksdale Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Mozer O. Da Cunha The pilot chute pops out of this roughly 18-inch by 10-inch can. It’s mounted on the door of the main chute compartment. The aircrew pulls the handle and the cable pops the door open. That action also pulls a pin on the pilot chute can. The pilot chute flies out via spring, catches air, and pulls the enormous main chute out. After use, after they clear the runway, they cycle the handle to release the main chute — which is secured by a different, much heavier pin — that attaches to the main and to the drogue. The airplane keeps the drogue chute canister and the bag. I’m making it seem more complex than it is. Everything released is recovered near the end of the runway by the people in the chute shop, who then inspect, repair, and repack it. One day-shift crew chief duty was to visit the chute shop and load up the truck for every flying aircraft that day, chute reinstallation being one of the last activities after recovery. A guy in the cockpit would cycle the handle to make sure everything works correctly and the main chute jaws-locking mechanism is open for installation, and then closed for use by the aircrew. Then the chute would be reinstalled. The truck driver was usually a seasoned tech sergeant. This is the AF equivalent of lower-level NCOs getting it done in pretty much every war movie. They ran the shift with a grease pencil and a plexi board with aircraft status and needs on it. Every job and every request flowed through them. During the day, they’re doing the routine tasks and routine maintenance and getting ready for recoveries. Come swing shift, they’re harried — every recovery crew needs a bunch of things. Mid-shift, it’s pretty low-key, they’re checking up on guys doing pre-flights. Staff Sgt. Michael Nichols, left, and Senior Airman Izumi Stanley, 20th Aircraft Maintenance Unit crew chiefs, connect latch cables to a drag chute door on a B-52 Stratofortress at Barksdale Air Force Base, La., Jan. 24, 2017. The latch cables are used to apply pressure needed to close the chute door. Once the latch is closed, the cables are disconnected, allowing the chute to easily slide out of the aircraft. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Mozer O. Da Cunha ‘The truck’ was painted blue and had benches along the sides in the back. It brought guys to and from the smoke pit and flight kitchen, brought tools, launch kits and ladders piled high to and from the aircraft, and towed things like generators and air carts and tires and jacks. A good truck driver was invaluable, and an inexperienced or bad one was borderline insufferable. You would walk a mile back to the hanger with a 40-pound toolbox rather than wait for them. Tell us about what went into a “cartridge start” on a B-52? We practiced cart starts, I think, once or twice a year. Not sure where the cartridges were stored, but we would get them and install them in the no. 4 and no. 5 engines during whatever exercise we were doing. Conventional and Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspections (CORI and NORI) were each 10 to 14 days a year. There was a NORI going on during 9/11, which is often left out of narratives. Many guys I worked with were at Barksdale on 9/11, and damn, they tell of seeing a huge plane come in (Air Force One), landing near B-52s loaded with live nukes, knowing that the national airspace was closed at that point. It had to be a weird feeling. And then the President makes an appearance and then took off again. A B-52 Stratofortress has its engine cart started during Global Thunder 2019 at Barksdale Air Force Base, La., Nov. 5, 2018. U.S. Air Force / Capt. Andrew Caulk Anyway, the carts are 10 inches or so in diameter and weigh maybe eight pounds. They were always described as large shotgun shells. They simply supply a huge volume of pressurized gas into the engine in a short time to turn the compressor. The carts were activated by a circuit from the aircraft’s battery, and as such had to be protected from static electricity as much as possible, lest they inadvertently fire. The B-52 doesn’t have static wicks like modern aircraft do, so grounding the aircraft after it landed was always stressed. There’s a port on each engine for a cartridge, so the crew could get in and go very, very quickly if need be. We practiced with engines 4 and 5 only, though, so they’d get a generator, hydraulics, and low-pressure air to start the other engines online quickly, using battery power alone. No external generator or air cart was needed, which was actually sort of weird to see. I think there was a lead-sealed switch over the applicable engine start switches when the carts were installed. Once you hit those switches, if you’ve got the appropriate settings, you will have engines running very quickly. If everything is pre-set, you can taxi out in minutes, after large plumes of smoke are blown aside quickly by engine exhaust. As an aside, I spent a couple of weeks on temporary duty at Minot AFB in 2004. I think it was a CORI, but I’m not sure. Our little detachment did our jobs and worked out of those old alert shelters that B-52 crews would live in for weeks at a time during the Cold War — and would run out of in the movies — so you knew the threat of war was real. Run up the ramp, and planes are ready to go, probably with carts already in the engines. These were bare-bones bunkers with libraries and recreation rooms frozen in 1988 or so. Never say no to a deployment, though. It was a sometimes really interesting, if mostly boring, couple of weeks. What are five highlights of servicing the B-52? In general, I think we took pride in how everything had to be done so rudimentarily. There were very few shortcuts. When it came down to it, we got stuff done. We had the most storied, badass airframe, and even in modern combat (Afghanistan, Iraq), the B-52 reliability rates were superior to other airframes. I liked maintenance like changing brakes, one of the more physically demanding jobs. A bunch of guys doing heavy maintenance on a plane on the flightline was what the job aspired to be ‘about.’ For some reason, putting such a big-ass plane on jacks was cool. It was hard work but getting it done was very satisfying. Everyone in the military knows what a B-52 is. You say “B-52 mechanic,” and people get it. Even later in life, going to school with some combat vets, there’d be some respect there, if only because it appeared to be a real job. U.S. Airman 1st Class Seth Bassett, 2d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief, takes a moment to look at the camera while preparing a B-52 Stratofortress for a flight July 7, 2021, at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. U.S. Air force photo by Senior Airman Kate Bragg Deploying to tropical islands — Guam and then forward deploying to Diego Garcia — to get a Global War On Terror medal. This was the most fun and most rewarding work/play I did in the Air Force. Working on a cool plane and lying on beaches. Getting that medal also meant enhanced benefits as a veteran. Really just ridiculous how lucky I got in that regard. Launching a plane was very rewarding. Doing the pre-flight, talking to the crew, getting the systems up and running, then marshaling them out, knowing how much work would go into each mission, and then seeing that huge plane take to the skies. Then, as soon as it lifts off, you could head home proud of what you did. It was a great feeling. Another fun, yet uncommon, exercise was the ERCC, the Engines Running Crew Change. You’re waiting at the end of the runway, so you can see the aircraft coming in basically overhead to do touch and goes, and then pull up, as the aircrew changes out. Let’s get to the lowlights. Everything takes forever. A plane land with 30,000 lbs of fuel and needing to fly with 310,000 lbs the next day would take many hours to refuel. If the powers that be decide that fuel tank maintenance is required, a defuel and drain might take two eight-hour shifts , using boost pumps to put that fuel into tanker trucks. Airman 1st Class Lucas Johnson, 2nd Logistics Readiness Squadron Fuel Management Flight fuels distribution operator, monitors the flow of fuel into a B-52 Stratofortress at Barksdale Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Philip Bryant Trying to refill the liquid oxygen when it’s 90 degrees outside. When the three 25-liter tanks were full, they’d spill over. When it’s hot out, that would never happen, so you do what you can. Let me clarify what I mean by this. Liquid oxygen (LOX) is stored at -297° F, so on a hot day, a lot of oxygen is boiling into the atmosphere before even making it into the aircraft. Also, note that the aircraft’s three 25-liter storage spheres aren’t mechanically cooled in any way. They are just large thermoses, with piping running from the aft part of the aircraft to the cockpit. So, if an aircraft is in the flying rotation, that’s a lot of LOX, and servicing time going to waste. Maybe a crew chief is spending four hours with two LOX carts to just get it up to, say, 60 liters, and they’ll have to do the same again in a day or two just to keep it ready to fly. No APU and no air conditioning mean extra work and lack of comfort. External power was supplied via a Hobart (because of the brand name) — a 3,000-lb old beast of a towable generator that needed to be working in order to conduct much maintenance. Every little thing might have to be serviced. No. 2 main hydraulic reservoir looks low? Get a ladder and a hydro cart. It’s pretty simple but it takes time. Another one of those situations where knowing the plane saves time and effort. Maybe the crew chief sees a main hydro reservoir come in low from a mission, but they know it’ll even out in a bit when the aircraft ‘settles,’ or if one just wiggles the spoilers, for example. Sixth Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron airmen perform maintenance on a B-52 Stratofortress in support of a Bomber Task Force deployment, Feb. 2, 2021, at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Jacob M. Thompson Because the jets are old, I think, lots of panels and the cowlings and so on just don’t fit well. If you’re reinstalling urinal flooring, you’re getting as many bolts as possible in, but then … maybe the rest just don’t work. And you have to sign off on that, because it’s the urinal flooring, and there’s no way anyone is doing that perfectly. So you have to know what you can pencil-whip and what needs to be worked on and/or sent up for more evaluation, just like anything else. With something like cowling, of course, a DCC might know their own plane and know that a certain engine’s cowling is just the worst to get back on. But that can’t be helped, and sometimes you’re out there with four guys for hours trying to get certain latches to line up. That’s stuff that obviously can’t be fudged, but was a huge, huge pain, literally, as we would be putting our arms and backs into holding the lower cowling in place for as long as possible with someone else trying to close a latch. Washing a B-52 isn’t exactly fun, especially with newer troops, who don’t understand that most everything needs to be ‘blended,’ not necessarily cleaned. B-52s can get very dirty, as you can imagine. A team of four crew chiefs might spend eight or 10 hours cleaning one plane to prevent corrosion. Mainly, you’re getting all the nastiness out of the landing gear, and some of the engine grime off the flaps. There’s a lot of grime, though, and at the end of the wash, it’s inspected by a higher-level supervisor. Airmen from the 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron wash a B-52H Stratofortress at Minot Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Brittany Y. Auld Blending just means not making one area super clean — and therefore wasting so much time that the rest of the plane isn’t going to be cleaned — or we’re not going home. To truly and extensively clean the grime off a B-52 would take … forever. Just like many things in the military, the idea is to not stand out. In this instance, that would be a new guy really, intensely cleaning the flaps right behind the engine exhaust, spending an hour making a very small section look very clean. Make everything look nice and even, and go home. Sucker door screens. This is so minute of a thing, but it really was one of the worst tasks to have to attend to. Here’s a link to what they look like. Those doors behind the engine’s nose cowling are spring-activated and open on the ground when the engines are run up to allow more air to enter the compressor. Under each door are two holes, allowing the air to enter, maybe an inch and a half in diameter, protected by a small screen to prevent ingestion of debris, secured by two bolts. Lest they become debris elements themselves, each bolt is, of course, safety-wired to the cowling. Two screens per door, 16 doors per cowling, 256 screens to be inspected during every postflight. Relatively easy to inspect, but a huge beast to remove and replace, and then safety-wire them and be sure there’s no debris at all leftover. I’m sorry to be so pedantic, but some of these things can really illustrate the intense and annoying labor involved. Airman 1st Class Khalil Miles-Palmer, 2nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron 20th Aircraft Maintenance Unit crew chief deployed from Barksdale Air Force Base, La., performs maintenance on the engine of a B-52 Stratofortress at RAF Fairford, England, March 28, 2019. U.S. Air Force / Staff Sgt. Philip Bryant Urinal stuff! So, there was a “honey pot” on the upper deck near the EWO/Gunner station. Crew chiefs never touched it. If someone in the crew has to poo, they would carry it out. I never experienced it myself, but there was a policy of a crew member being called back out to the aircraft to deal with it if they forgot. The urinal was a different story. The ‘urinal’ was a five-gallon jerry-can near the main hatch with a large funnel. That’s it. On a post-flight inspection, right after the jet lands, there’d usually be three people, if I remember correctly—one for engine oil, one for body inspection, one for the cockpit. The cockpit person would take the urinal out almost immediately after safeing the ejection seats (which was always the very first thing) because it would already stink. There are stormwater drains all over, and no, urine was not disposed of properly on the flightline. From Diego Garcia to Afghanistan was about eight hours each way, for about two hours of combat coverage, so 18+ hours total. Many training flights were also long. Lots of urine , but that’s what we signed up for, as airmen. “TYFYS” (thank you for your service) has to encompass all of these weird/bad experiences. I somehow doubt civilians understand what taking orders entails, even on a low level such as this. Sr. Airman Nicholas Beltz, 5th Maintenance Squadron crew chief, manually unscrews bolts at Minot Air Force Base, N.D. U.S. Air Force / Airman Jesse Jenny For some inspections, the urinal flooring had to be removed and cleaned, and the surrounding under-areas inspected for corrosion. The flooring itself never fit the same way twice, so it was always a terrible job, trying to align as many of the, say, 40 bolts on these weirdly-shaped panels as possible before calling a hopefully sympathetic supervisor over to inspect and sign-off the work as good. As an aside, crew chiefs working on the flightline were most often pretty far from a bathroom. We did not use the urinal, we used the bomb bay, with the open doors providing ample privacy. If there’s a hydraulic leak, it’s red fluid, so it cannot be mistaken. As I alluded to earlier, if it’s not red, do not inspect the leak in the bomb bay! What other stuff just breaks the most? Cowling latches. Lots of stuff didn’t fit right, and we’d be pounding on it to get the job done, but then, of course, it doesn’t fit right in the future either. Not a great position to be in, pounding on the outside of an engine with a rubber mallet. From a systems standpoint? Tons of small hydraulic leaks. If I were more astute back in the day, I’d have asked the hydraulics or electrics shops, or the ECM (electronic countermeasure) guys, or life support guys, what their nightmares were. I think lots of times crews during launch would call in for a specialist section for whatever system and a reset circuit breaker would solve the problem. So, I guess, overall, “circuit breakers” would be my mission-critical answer. U.S. Airman 1st Class Seth Bassett, 2d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief, stands in front of a B-52 Stratofortress during a pre-flight July 7, 2021, at Barksdale Air Force Base, La. The B-52 has eight engines with 17,000 pounds of thrust each. U.S. Air force / Sr. Airman Kate Bragg The BUFF can carry a lot of very powerful weaponry. This must have been a major consideration on the ground during some operations, right? In terms of weaponry, yes, it can carry some powerful stuff. Flying from Barksdale, almost all missions are training missions. Ninety-five percent launched without even dummy weapons. Once in a while, you’d have some blue-painted JDAMs or 500-pound non-explosive bombs. Rarely, they’d use live munitions for training over Nevada or wherever. No matter, if weapons (as in the weapons unit) were involved, they would do their work after all maintenance and servicing were done with the aircraft. They’d do their thing, and some of their guys would be around for the launch to talk to the crew, as well. On Diego Garcia, we were flying combat missions over Afghanistan. Sort of the same situation, though every bomber was taking off with 12 live JDAMs, six on each wing. Three hours of “hover” time after and before eight hours of travel time from and to the “footprint of freedom.” I spent about two months on Diego Garcia, and I can say that the only time I saw a bomber come back with weapons released was this incident. A B-52 loaded with JDAMs launches out of Diego Garcia. The structures in the background are the B-2’s climate-controlled clamshell shelters. Courtesy of John Brehman Nuclear stuff was obviously very different. Every year we had NORIs, and in the lead-up to those exercises, those aircraft participating had to be shit-hot. If your aircraft was participating, you had to have everything possible in working order. It was exciting. Then they loaded the nukes. Eight on a rotary launcher in the bomb bay, six on each wing. If you’re around the aircraft, you can’t be out of sight of anyone else. There’s always a Security Forces cop at the nose of each aircraft posted there. IDs are checked extensively. It’s a serious situation. It’s also weird to hang out (no general maintenance is going on after the nukes are loaded, but we had to be around in case of anything) around 20 missiles, each of which could take out a whole major city. It’s sobering. It makes one question why and how things operate the way they do. I never felt, in my personal experience, unsafe, but having read about nuclear incidents and knowing how many nukes are out there, it’s really incredible we have made it this far without an accidental nuclear disaster. Sr. Airman Samuel Hunter, 2nd Security Forces Squadron Close-In Sentry (CIS), guards a B-52 Stratofortress during Global Thunder 2019 at Barksdale Air Force Base. U.S. Air Force / Airman 1st Class Sydney Campbell B-52s can act as their own cargo haulers to a certain extent. Can you speak to that a bit? The 47 section in the tail is really the only place to store extra equipment. It has only enough space for a launch kit or two, for ground comms headsets and cords, rags, flashlights, toolboxes, and maybe a couple of drag chutes, assuming there’s a stand at the destination to install it. Also some milk crates of engine oil and hydraulic fluid, of course. I don’t think I ever saw luggage back there. I’m pretty sure the crew, being deployed, would have their stuff with them in the crew compartment. Again, really it could be used if necessary, like, say going to an overseas airshow without a lot of support equipment or personnel. Staff Sgt. Brett Jordan, 5th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief, inspects the tail of a B-52H Stratofortress. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Brittany Y. Bateman You were part of the first deployment of the 11th Bomber Squadron to Guam since the Vietnam War. What was that experience like? Andersen AFB on the island was far less updated than it is now I would imagine? When the 20th Bomb Squadron deployed to Guam, I was just lucky to be asked to volunteer to join them. I got back from leave in February 2003 and saw a note on my dorm room bed (barracks, but it’s the Air Force) from my first sergeant to call as soon as I got in. “Do you want to deploy for eight to 12 months?” Sure, of course. “Alright, pack your bags, you’re going to Guam.” Great snap decision. There were a lot of things at play — I’m sure the logistics of moving a squadron of airmen in the early months of 2003 to anywhere but the Middle East was extremely complex — so we didn’t know until basically the day before that we were actually leaving. Hurry up and wait. We flew Hawaiian Airlines charter from Barksdale to Honolulu, refueled, and went from there to Andersen AFB. The conditions were miserable, but it was interesting because we were the first deployed unit since Vietnam. Housing wasn’t good. 30 people to a bay, working different shifts, sharing a bathroom with five shower stalls. Some people had hotel housing, stacked on each other. But we were on a major base, and outside the base was tourism and culture, which we, as young airmen, took advantage of. B-52s operating out of Guam. U.S. Air Force / Master Sgt. Richard P. Ebensberger In terms of work, the higher-ups did have to figure out the logistics of how to, you know, actually get bombs and parts and such in a short amount of time. But we were “operational,” meaning deployed aircrews were flying familiarity flights around the Pacific very quickly. A wild guess is that, since deployed elements have been at Andersen since spring of 2003, it’s probably a lot more habitable now. No idea if they’re using the 30-person bays built during/after World War II. The two-room suites we eventually moved into also sucked, because it’s six people in two rooms, and, again, people working different shifts. The few months I was there, everything was thrown together, as it had to be, even on a major Pacific base, but that was part of the charm. What do you think of the Air Force’s plan to see these aircraft serve into the back half of the century? Now the H models are all 60+ years old … and there’s nothing to replace them. The biggest pitfall is that as airframes rack-up cycles, even unpressurized, there’s just stress and corrosion that builds up. At some point it’s not worth it, for any given airframe, to do the extensive maintenance. As for the new engines , we just saw four-engine concepts that looked pretty ridiculous. … The TF-33s, in my day, were pretty reliable — there weren’t a lot of engine changes — but that’s probably changed in the last 15-plus years. They are probably a ton more maintenance-intensive now. U.S. Air Force airmen repair a B-52H Stratofortress engine during a Bomber Task Force deployment at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. U.S. Air Force / Sr. Airman Jovante Johnson I wonder about the instrumentation, which I imagine will have to be updated in some way, and integrated into the other systems (hydraulic and electric). I imagine the re-engine process means a lot more data available to everyone involved, which would be great for aircraft longevity and maintenance, but I obviously can’t speak on anything specifically. I just keep wondering what that means for instrumentation and the other systems connected to engine systems. Lower fuel consumption would also mean shorter refuel times and/or higher take-off payloads, which is also good for everyone involved.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Over the last year, China has been regularly engaged in potential conflict zones on both its eastern and western borders. Territorial issues with India and Taiwan have reached new heights. This brought the Taiwan Strait and the Line of Actual Control along the Indian Border onto front pages around the world as Chinese and Indian soldiers entered into scuffles and People’s Liberation Army aircraft began to flood into the Taiwanese air defense identification zone. While most eyeballs focused on the saber-rattling in the east, we detailed China’s sudden airpower expansion on its western border, focusing on new airbase development and upgrades to existing airfields. Further investigations have now revealed a similar construction spree aimed at heliport capacity in the region. Satellite imagery shows the development of several new heliports across the Tibetan Plateau. This vast elevated landform is the highest and largest plateau in the world. Surrounded by mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, it is almost five times the size of California. This rapid development of infrastructure clearly underlines China’s advancements and trust in its platforms enabling better air connectivity throughout the plateau’s remote locales for quick troop movement and logistics, as well as emergency relief work. China first deployed its Z-20 utility helicopter to Tibet in 2020 . The Z-20 will help overcome some of the complications to vertical lift operations caused by the air density at high altitudes and variations in airflow through the mountainous terrain. Other updated helicopter types now in China’s inventory also feature improved high-altitude performance over their predecessors. In Golmud, on the northern edge of the plateau, a behemoth heliport can be seen under construction south of its existing airport. A total of 63 individual hangars are visible along with the construction of barracks and support buildings. A review of past satellite imagery indicates the site began construction in early 2020 and has almost reached completion. Golmud is situated in an area that was historically part of Tibet, but that is currently situated in the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of China’s Qinghai Province. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION Golmud has been seeing regular Peoples Liberation Army drills west and south of the city throughout the border crisis, along with the construction of large barracks and military training facilities. It also hosts a major railway junction connecting China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Xining and Korla, two large cities in neighboring Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces, respectively. These cities are also known to serve as bases for a variety of PLA military contingents. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The airport already serves as a key logistics hub, with commercial and military aircraft parking areas. Bomber, fighter, airborne early warning and transport aircraft regularly deploy to the airfield. A large contingent of helicopters also calls the facility home. These helicopter operations will certainly be relocated and greatly expanded once the new heliport is operational. PHOTO © GOOGLE EARTH It appears a very large heliport here would greatly enhance China’s ability to improve training or execute troop movements and rapid logistical operations towards any section of the Sino-Indo border if the need arises. The combination of the airbase, railways, and heliport also converts Golmud into a logistics hub capable of supporting any military mobilization, large or small, with a variety of equipment. Moving deeper into Tibet, we see a string of heliports almost equidistant from each other located in various remote townships. The smaller heliports, while still quite large, hosting around 18 hangars, also appear to have their own fuel storage and servicing points, allowing them to maintain connectivity and ensure sustainability for operations between large distances.  These smaller heliports, in conjunction with pre-existing airbases, and the large master heliport in Golmud, when mapped, also spell out a clear aerial logistics network being realized across the plateau which could benefit military, armed police, and emergency work. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION We have also noticed renovations and expansion activity at older pre-existing heliports such as the one in Lhasa, which is located in one of the most populated urban areas of Tibet. The heliport has seen new hangars being constructed along with the deployment of UAVs indicating a multi-purpose role to the structure. PHOTO © GOOGLE EARTH Near Doklam and Aksai Chin, not too far from areas where India and China have regularly clashed , new, smaller heliports continue to be developed. These heliports would also greatly enhance troop movement for the Chinese forces allowing for rapid response and support in case of any future clashes. During a major conflict, they would be essential forward operating and resupply points. PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION All said, the absolutely massive heliport taking shape in Golmud is indicative of a larger undertaking, one based around a major vertical lift network that is rapidly taking shape on the Tibetan Plateau. It stands to significantly enhance Beijing’s ability to quickly project power and sustain military operations throughout the tense region, even independent of runways. The importance of rotary-wing operations in China’s contingency plans for fighting conflicts on its borders is becoming more clear with every passing day. Another huge heliport has been built on the edge of the Taiwan Strait, for instance. But even that one, which has made international headlines, could be considered quaint compared to what we are seeing come to life in Golmud. @detresfa_ is an independent open-source intelligence analyst who has worked as a consultant to The Intel Lab, an independent intelligence analysis group who is reachable at detresfa@protonmail.ch detresfa_ Contributor Air Helicopters"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 29, 2022",Here’s What You Should Know About The Escalating Crisis Along Belarus’ Border,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A crisis involving groups of people traveling from the Middle East who are now trapped along the western borders of Belarus has been going on for months now and only continues to heat up. Here’s what this confusing situation is all about and its current state of play. Just today, Poland’s Ministry of Defense accused Belarusian security forces of fomenting a new round of violence by these individuals, who threw rocks and other objects at Polish personnel, causing non-life-threatening injuries to at least one Polish soldier. The governments of Poland, as well as Latvia and Lithuania, all of which are NATO members, have called on the alliance to do more, while the European Union has imposed new sanctions on Belarus in response to what it has described as aÂ “ hybrid attack .” There is strong evidence that authorities in Belarus, possibly with direct or indirect support from their allies in Russia, have deliberately weaponized groups of people coming from the Middle East. The Belarusian government has been accused of trying to force these individuals over their western borders in retaliation for sanctions the European Union imposed earlier this year against the regime of long-time dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The sanctions in question had been leveled at Lukashenko and his government in May over the effective hijacking of an entire Ryanair flight, which was forced to land in the country’s capital Minsk so that Belarusian officials could arrest a dissident journalist onboard. Just yesterday, the European Union announced new sanctions against Belarus, including ending lease agreements covering 17 of the 29 aircraft operated by the state-flag carrier, Belavia. Belavia has been directly implicated in facilitating the movement of individuals from the Middle East, especially Iraq and Syria, to Belarus via intermediate points.Â EU sanctions mean Belavia will lose 17 of its 29 planes leased from the EU. Lukashenko is literally destroying the national carrier with his border stunt. AprÃ¨s moi, le dÃ©luge. https://t.co/bRSy9xeD2I — Leonid Ragozin (@leonidragozin) November 15, 2021 Many of the people, who are commonly termed “migrants,” claim to have actively been lured to the Eastern European country on various false pretenses , including promises of support in legally reaching western Europe , as well as tourism packages. After arriving, however, they were then forced to move to camps with squalid conditions in various border areas by Belarusian security forces.Â The Kuznica-Bruzgi border crossing point, where the Polish soldier was injured, has become a particular flashpoint in the last day or so, as you can see in the imagery in the Tweets below. Polish authorities have accused the Belarusian security services of deliberately orchestrating the clashes today. Polish personnel have used water cannons, tear gas, flash-bang grenades, and other riot control tools in response.

Authorities in Poland have been criticized for their handling of the situation, as well, which has raised questions about the country’s adherence to international humanitarian obligations. It’s hard to see how a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe would not have been a factor in why Belarusian authorities decided that this course of action would be an effective asymmetric attack on its neighbors in the first place. At least 11 “migrants,” including at least one child, have reportedly died so far.Â Hundreds of migrants can be seen camping along the Belarus side of the Kuznica border crossing with Poland, as seen on this @Maxar satellite image taken today. pic.twitter.com/OZf1kDOowV — Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) November 10, 2021 â€œWe are discussing with Latvia and especially Lithuania about whether to trigger Article 4,â€ Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Sunday . â€œIt seems that it is needed more and more. It is not enough to publicly express our concern. Now concrete steps and the commitment of the whole alliance are needed.” Article 4 refers to a mechanism within the treaty that established NATO that allows for any member to call for an alliance-wide consultation on issues that “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.” Unlike a NATO member invoking Article 5, Article 4 is not a direct call for any sort of collective military action. However, in the past, Article 4 consultations have led to the deployment of NATO forces to member states for defense purposes, such as sending Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to Turkey on multiple occasions in response to concerns about regional ballistic-missile threats . There has already been some movement on the part of other NATO members to help bolster security along the Alliance’s borders with Belarus. Last week, it was reported that Royal Engineers from the British Army had deployed to Poland specifically to help strengthen border fortifications. In July, Estonia, which is situated just north of Latvia but does not share a border with Belarus, pledged to send reels of barbed wire to Lithuania to help reinforce that country’s physical barriers.Â There have been accusations that Belarusian security services have been destroying barriers along the border or aiding groups trying to cross in doing so themselves. Over the weekend, the Polish Border Guard released a video, seen below, that it said showed Belarusian soldiers attempting to destroy a fence while blinding Polish forces with strobe lights and lasers. Belarusian soldiers tried to destroy a Polish border fence last night. Our servicemen were blinded by laser beams and strobe light as well as tear gas were used against Polish Border Guard. Another attempt to cross the Polish-Belarusian border illegally was prevented. https://t.co/3GERjLlgVO — Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland (@PremierRP_en) November 13, 2021 Over the summer, Estonia had announced that it was prepared to send unspecified unmanned aircraft to help monitor the situation, but it’s unclear if those assets were ever deployed. Just in the past week or so, online flight tracking software has shown a U.S. Air Force E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft and one of the service’s RC-135W Rivet Joints , as well as a U.S. Army RC-12X Guardrail turboprop and a specially-configured Bombardier Challenger 600 jet operating under contract to that service, all flying opposite the Belarusian border. All of these are intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft that could be used to collect various types of information, including intercepted communications chatter, as well as track certain movements, including by vehicles that might be carrying groups headed to border areas .

Not a migration crisis,” Ursula von der Leyen, President of the E.U. Commission, Tweeted last week. “Hybrid” in this case appears to be a reference to hybrid warfare, a broad concept that covers a blending of military and non-military tactics employed directly or indirectly in conflicts and other crises. These asymmetric tactics can include â€” but are certainly not limited to â€” cyberwarfare , propaganda and disinformation campaigns , and economic threats , initiated either directly by a state or through proxies. These are things that Russia, in particular, has come to excel at, as you can read more about here . I had a productive meeting with @POTUS at the White Houseâ° We touched upon a series of issues including the situation at the border with Belarusâ° This is a hybrid attack. Not a migration crisis Â Beginning of next week, we will very quickly expand our sanctions against Belarus. pic.twitter.com/nsdCVLbyk4 — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) November 10, 2021 In addition to sanctions, there are certainly diplomatic efforts ongoing to try to resolve the crisis. Yesterday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who remains head of state in that country after national elections in September did not produce a clear winning coalition , reportedly spoke directly with Lukashenko about the situation. Unsurprisingly, Russia has both denied any direct involvement in the crisis and has sought to position itself as a peacemaker of sorts. Last week, Russian officials went so far as to raise the idea of the European Union providing financial assistance to Belarus to relocate individuals from the border. Last Friday, the Embassy of Iraq in Moscow announced plans to repatriate any Iraqi nationals from Belarus who wish to leave, though specific details about how that would be done and whether the Russian government would be involved in any way remain unclear. At the same time, the Kremlin has recently staged a number of military exercises that are clearly meant to demonstrate its commitment to its allies in Minsk. This has included long-range sorties involving Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bombers and a large airborne drill, during which two paratroopers died in an accident.Â https://youtube.com/watch?v=UG2eIdLBZgw Though there are concerns about the potential for some sort of interstate clash on the border, the risk of major direct military action against Belarus seems low. Thus, these exercises would seem to be intended in no small part for the benefit of Lukashenko personally . The Belarusian dictator has increasingly presented himself as under siege from foreign threats following huge protests after the country’s most recent national election last year, which was widely decried as neither free nor fair . The regime in Belarus has drawn additional criticism for its brutal crackdown on protestors. There is, of course, a fear that the crisis could continue to escalate, as it has in recent weeks, to the point where a miscalculation or other error in judgment on either side might lead to an actual conflict. Prior to today’s injury, Polish authorities had announced on Saturday that one of the country’s soldiers deployed to the border had died in an accidental shooting involving a Polish service weapon, though specific details about the incident remain limited. There have been accusations dating back to at least October from both sides of the border about Belarusian and other countries’ security forces shooting at each other or at least threatening to do so.Â The United States has alleged the crisis along the border with Belarus is, at least in part, a deliberate attempt to distract from a worrisome situation developing in areas of Russia situated opposite from Ukraine. “The actions by the Lukashenka regime threaten security, sow division, and aim to distract from Russiaâ€™s activities on the border with Ukraine,” top U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement on Nov. 14, regarding a call between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau the day before. Russia has been conducting large-scale exercises on land, at sea, and in the air in the Black Sea region recently, which some fear could be a prelude to a new surge in fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region . Russian-supported forces there have been fighting the government in Kyiv since 2014, the same year that the Kremlin seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.Â Satellite image taken today by @Maxar reveals presence of a large ground forces deployment â€” incl. tanks, APCs, self-propelled artillery â€” to a training area north of Yelnya, Russia. pic.twitter.com/fitG2APRZc — Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) November 1, 2021 Similar concerns emerged after Russian forces flooded into areas near Ukraine earlier this year. Many of those forces never really returned to their garrisons.Â “We do continue to see unusual military activity and concentration of forces in Russia, but near Ukrainian borders, and that remains concerning to us,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said yesterday, reiterating comments he had made last week. “There’s been no transparency from the Russian side about this concentration of forces in the western part of their country and we continue to urge them to be so transparent.” At least for the moment, neither that transparency nor a de-escalation in the crises in and around Belarus or Ukraine appears to be forthcoming.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 30, 2021",Russian Anti-Satellite Test Produces Dangerous Debris Cloud In Orbit (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia may have just conducted an anti-satellite weapon test. These reports are based on the apparent breakup of a satellite known as Kosmos-1408, part of a long-defunct Soviet-era electronic intelligence constellation, which has now created a cloud of debris that could threaten the International Space Station . It’s unclear exactly when this test may have occurred, but the first reports began to appear online earlier today. There has been no official word so far from Russian authorities. When reached for comment, U.S. Space Force redirected us to U.S. Space Command, which has issued press releases after Russian anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon tests in the past.Â The video below shows a past test of Russia’s A-235 Nudol, a ballistic missile interceptor with anti-satellite capabilities. “U.S. Space Command is aware of a debris-generating event in outer space,” Space Command subsequently told The War Zone in a statement that did not specifically say this incident was the result of an ASAT test. “We are actively working to characterize the debris field and will continue to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to maneuver satellites if impacted. We are also in the process of working with the interagency, including the State Department and NASA, concerning these reports and will provide an update in the near future.” However, experts and observers have said that there are indications that this was an ASAT test.Â “ASAT missile strike now suspected. Seradata SpaceTrak database orbital data had Cosmos 1408 in a 487 x 461 km orbit – a bit higher than ISS but not much,” read a Tweet from the official Twitter account for Seradata , a private space data-analysis company. “The ASAT strike on Cosmos 1408 would cause some debris to be fired below it … threatening ISS with a crossing debris cloud.” “Reports coming through of ASAT (Anti-satellite) test by Russia on one of its own satellites Cosmos 1408 (Kosmos-1408) (1982-092A/13552),” an earlier Tweet from the company said. “14 pieces of debris tracked so far.” ASAT missile strike now suspected.

Tselina-D provided detailed observation of radio sources detected by the smaller Tselina-O satellites,” according to Gunter’s Space Page , which is maintained by space expert Gunter Krebs. There are reports, that Russia has conducted an Anti-satellite ( #ASAT ) weapons test. Target was an old Soviet Tselina-D SIGINT satellite called Kosmos-1408 (1982-092A) launched in 1982, which has been dead for decades. 14 debris objects have been tracked. https://t.co/3rtUpvoMjN — Gunter Krebs ğŸš€ ğŸ›° ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ ğŸ³ï¸â€ğŸŒˆ (@Skyrocket71) November 15, 2021 The Tselina constellation has been out of service for decades, having been replaced by improved Tselina-2 satellites that the Soviets began launching in the mid-1980s. “No further details so far, but it appears that a ground based missile was used, not a co-orbital-ASAT like the earlier soviet ASAT systems,” Krebs tweeted, stressing that he could not independently confirm if this had been the case.Â Caveat: So far no confirmation from official sources. My unofficial source has been pretty reliable on topics like this in the past, but i would like to have independent confirmation. These days it has become difficult to get information on topics like this from Russia. — Gunter Krebs ğŸš€ ğŸ›° ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ ğŸ³ï¸â€ğŸŒˆ (@Skyrocket71) November 15, 2021 Russia certainly does have land-based ASAT interceptors . However, they have at least been testing air-launched types , as well as co-orbital weapons mounted on other satellites.Â Space Command accused the Kremlin of carrying out two “direct-ascent” ASAT tests, typically understood to involve ground-launched interceptors, in 2020. Last year, Space Force separately disclosed that it had observed at least one on-orbit ASAT test. That revelation came after reports, including from The War Zone , that a small Russian satellite had maneuvered very closely to an American intelligence satellite and was shadowing it. A graphical representation of the position of the Russian satellite Cosmos 2542 with regard to the American satellite USA 245 in January 2020., VIA @M_R_THOMP That satellite “behaved similar to previous Russian satellites that exhibited characteristics of a space weapon, conducted maneuvers near a U.S. Government satellite that would be interpreted as irresponsible and potentially threatening in any other domain,” according to a press release from Space Command in April 2020. A subsequent statement from that command in December 2020 described the event as having actually “demonstrated an on-orbit kinetic [ASAT] weapon.” An infographic depicting the various ways in which one satellite might attack another in orbit., DIA If Russia did indeed deliberately destroy Kosmos-1408 in an ASAT test, it would only further underscore how real this threat is now and how it will only become more of an issue as time goes on. Earlier this month, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that President Vladimir Putin had ordered the development of new air and missile defense system known as the S-550.Â It is unclear what this S-550 system might be. A Soviet-era design with that same nomenclature, which never came to fruition, was intended to be used against intercontinental ballistic missiles, possibly in the midcourse portions of their flights when they are flying very fast and at extremely high altitudes in space. Any such missile-defense interceptor would inherently have potential as an ASAT weapon, and Russian state media reports have now indicated this new S-550 is expected to be dual-purpose. China, among others , is in the process of developing and fielding its own various anti-satellite capabilities . For potential American adversaries, this all makes good sense, as the U.S. military and intelligence community are heavily dependent on space-based systems for intelligence gathering , as well as a variety of other functions, including early warning , navigation and weapons guidance , and communications, and data-sharing. Beyond all this, the potential risk to the ISS from this debris would also highlight the dangers posed simply by testing ASAT weapons. Whether or not American or Russian officials eventually confirm that an ASAT test occurred, hopefully any risks to the ISS and any other objects in space will turn out to be minimal. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Updated 1:25 PM EST: CNN is now reporting the U.S. State Department is planning later today to issue a statement that American officials have assessed that Russia did conduct an ASAT test sometime in the past few days.Â More: The US is very concerned about aÂ major Russian anti-satellite weapons test conducted over the weekend and the State Department is preparing to put out a statement on the matter today, two US officials tell me and my colleague @kylieatwood — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) November 15, 2021 In the meantime, other evidence that this “debris-generating event” was an ASAT test is growing. A previously issued warning notice to airmen and mariners said that a potential rocket launch could occur early on Nov. 15 from Russia’s Plesetsk Cosmodrome, which is used for space launches and missile tests. Experts and observers have noted that the apparent path of this prospective launch would align well with Kosmos-1408’s orbit.

He described the test as “reckless” and said that it involved the use of a direct-ascent interceptor. “The test has so far generated over 1500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of 1000s of pieces of smaller orbital debris that now threaten the interests of all nations,” Price said at a press conference today. “This test will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities.” “Russia’s dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long-term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia’s claims of opposing the weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical,” he continued. “The United States will work with our allies and partners to respond to Russia’s irresponsible act.” “We as you know, don’t telegraph specific measures, but as I said before, we will work with our allies and partners in different ways to make clear that the United States that the international community is not going to tolerate this kind of irresponsible behavior,” he said in response to a subsequent question from a member of the press. At a separate press conference, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said that “we share the concern that our State Department colleagues stressed” regarding the Russian ASAT test. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby says in a briefing that ""we share the concern that our State Department colleagues stressed"" about Russia's ASAT test. https://t.co/URlMwTJIo6 — Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) November 15, 2021 Updated 5:10 PM EST: U.S. Space Command now issued its own statement about the recent Russian ASAT test, which is as follows: Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite (DA-ASAT) missile test on Nov. 15, 2021, Moscow Standard Time, that struck a Russian satellite [COSMOS 1408] and created a debris field in low-Earth orbit. The test so far has generated more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris. â€œRussia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,â€ said U.S. Army Gen. James Dickinson, U.S. Space Command commander. â€œThe debris created by Russia’s DA-ASAT will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers. Space activities underpin our way of life and this kind of behavior is simply irresponsible.â€ USSPACECOM’s initial assessment is that the debris will remain in orbit for years and potentially for decades, posing a significant risk to the crew on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities, as well as multiple countries’ satellites. USSPACECOM continues to monitor the trajectory of the debris and will work to ensure all space-faring nations have the information necessary to safeguard their on-orbit activities if impacted by the debris cloud, a service the United States provides to the world, to include Russia and China. â€œRussia is developing and deploying capabilities to actively deny access to and use of space by the United States and its allies and partners,â€ Dickinson added. â€œRussia’s tests of direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons clearly demonstrate that Russia continues to pursue counterspace weapon systems that undermine strategic stability and pose a threat to all nations.â€ Updated 6:35 PM EST: Marcia Smith, editor of SpacePolicyOnline.com has posted a statement from NASA regarding Russia’s ASAT test on Twitter, which includes direct quotes from Administrator Bill Nelson, who says he is “outraged.” The statement also confirms various details about actions personnel onboard the ISS had to take to mitigate potential risks from the debris cloud, including sheltering in place in the docked spacecraft. Just got this from NASA. pic.twitter.com/7ZrYOGQvlD — Marcia Smith (@SpcPlcyOnline) November 15, 2021 Updated 11/16/2021: Russia’s Defense Ministry has finally confirmed that it conducted an ASAT test on Nov. 15. “We have indeed successfully tested a future system. It destroyed an old satellite with pinpoint accuracy,” Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said. The Kremlin has rejected the assertion that doing so created significant risks to the ISS and other spacecraft from the resulting debris cloud, despite clear evidence that this was and remains the case. Russia’s own space agency, Roscosmos, had earlier issued a statement that it was monitoring the debris in order to “prevent and counter all possible threats to the safety” to the ISS. “The United States knows for certain that the emerging fragments at the time of the test and in terms of the orbitâ€™s parameters did not and will not pose any threat to orbital stations, satellites and space activity,” the Defense Ministry’s statement declared . “Earlier, such tests in outer space were already conducted by the United States, China, and India.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said earlier that there “were no facts” to the U.S. government’s claims. This statement seems to have been in response to American accusations about the resulting debris field, though it initially appeared that Lavrov was denying the ASAT test had taken place at all.Â And here's Russia's Defense Ministry confirming there was a ""successful missile test"" destroying an nonoperational satellite; also denying that fragments pose any risk to the @Space_Station (""The US knows this."") @interfax_news pic.twitter.com/hXaAyfR8zd — Mike Eckel (@Mike_Eckel) November 16, 2021 Â Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Anti-Satellite Capabilities Russian Space Program Space War In Space"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2021",Giant Turboprop Attack Plane Reminiscent Of The A-1 Skyraider Unveiled At Dubai Airshow,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The appearance of an all-new military aircraft design is a fairly rare occurrence these days, but rarer still when the aircraft in question belongs to a new category in terms of mission spectrum, size, and performance. The Calidus B-350, which broke cover in mock-up form at the ongoing Dubai Airshow , fits this bill: A new offering from the Abu Dhabi-based company , the aircraft is a relatively enormous single-engine turboprop attack platform, broadly akin to a Douglas A-1 Skyraider albeit thoroughly updated for the 21st century. Making a surprise appearance at the exhibition, the two-seat B-350 looks at first sight fairly similar to other turboprop offerings in the light attack category, such as the Embraer A-29 Super Tucano that’s being evaluated by U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, or AFSOC. The difference, though, is the huge size of the B-350. Its proportions are very deceiving until you put a human being next to it and you realize it is a bizarre monster of an aircraft: While that much is clear from a cursory examination of the mock-up, the limited detailed information that has crept out about the B-350 thus far comes mainly from CHARVÁT AXL, a Czech company that has signed a contract to deliver landing gear sets for the aircraft. An in-house publication reveals some data relating to the B-350, including a wingspan stretching more than 50 feet and a maximum takeoff weight of around 20,000 pounds. By way of contrast, the A-29 has a wingspan of just over 36 and a half feet and a maximum takeoff weight of just under 12,000 pounds. By this measure, the slab-sided B-350 is a true beast — a ‘mecha Tucano,’ if you like. Side view of the B-350 mock-up., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The B-350 really appears much closer in size and ambition to the Cold War-era Skyraider that served with distinction with the U.S. Navy in Korea , with the U.S. Air Force and Navy in Vietnam, and with a variety of other operators in combat duty around the world. The A-1 also had a 50-foot wingspan, while its maximum takeoff weight was a little over 18,000 pounds. An armed U.S. Air Force A-1H Skyraider assigned to the 6th Special Operations Squadron at Pleiku, South Vietnam, in 1969. The aircraft is armed with six Mk 82 500-pound bombs with ‘Daisy Cutter’ fuzes and two Mk 20 Rockeye cluster bombs., U.S. Air Force The Emirati aircraft is powered by a 2,600-horsepower Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127, the same unit that’s used in the ATR 72 twin-turboprop regional airliner and the Airbus C295M military transport. The aircraft will reportedly be built mainly using carbon-fiber composites. A head-on view of the B-350 mock-up together with a wide range of dummy weapons., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP All this size and power translates to a considerable load-carrying capability, with a wide range of weapons and sensors that can be lugged on no fewer than 12 underwing hardpoints, some of which can accommodate dual launchers. Stores options include precision-guided air-to-ground missiles and bombs and infrared-guided air-to-air missiles — as well as various sensors for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting. The mock-up was shown alongside an array of possible ordnance , including Al-Tariq bomb kits produced by the UAE’s Edge company. Images of the B-350 appear in the first half of the following video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=o5hawSylwXQ Additional stores, including a large multi-sensor targeting/surveillance turret, and radar/electronic warfare pods, can be carried on further stations below the fuselage. It’s also possible that the B-350 may be especially suitable for certain niche roles, such as anti-helicopter missions, which would require gun pods or lightweight air-to-air missiles . The B-350 is a follow-on to the Calidus B-250 , which was unveiled at the Dubai Airshow in 2017 and is a turboprop trainer and light attack aircraft of much more conventional proportions. Powered by a 1,600-horsepower Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-68, the B-250 was designed by Novaer, a Brazilian company that was headed up by the late Joseph Kovács, who had designed the original Tucano for Embraer. The first two B-250s were built in Brazil before being shipped to the UAE. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the B-250 has much in common with the Tucano/Super Tucano in terms of form and function. One of the prototype Calidus B-250s., Calidus At the 2019 edition of the airshow, the United Arab Emirates placed a $620-million order for 24 B-250s, an air force spokesperson telling reporters that “it’s a UAE platform for the UAE.” However, the status of the B-250 order remains unclear, with the UAE Air Force currently relying on a mixed fleet of German Grob G 115 and Swiss PC-7 and PC-21 turboprop trainers. In the meantime, Calidus has also announced a more advanced version of the trainer, the B-250T, which offers new features including a mission-recording and debriefing system, and optional simulated radar and weapons. Intriguingly, there were unconfirmed rumors back in 2019 that the B-250 design had already been judged unsatisfactory, and AirForces Monthly reported on “speculation that ongoing development will probably see a bigger, more suitable aircraft being developed […] called the B-350.” Regardless of its relationship to the B-250 order, the B-350 might still attract domestic interest anyway, as the UAE continues to develop its Joint Aviation Command (JAC), a separate flying branch that’s dedicated to counterinsurgency and tackling other asymmetric threats. Currently, the JAC operates the fixed-wing IOMAX Archangel close air support and ISR aircraft, based on the Thrush S2R-660 crop-duster, and which you can read more about here . These serve alongside Cessna 208s and Twin Otters , as well as various rotorcraft, including AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The B-350 may therefore have been tailored as a follow-on to the Archangel, offering expanded performance, endurance, and weapons carriage. Compared to the B-350, the Archangel has just six underwing hardpoints, plus one on the centerline, as well as a maximum takeoff weight of 14,800 pounds. The IOMAX design is not fast, with the manufacturer advertising a cruising speed of 180 knots, with undisclosed stores. Calidus may also be hopeful of securing export orders for the big turboprop, perhaps from operators that require something more than an A-29 or an AT-6 Wolverine , but which still prize the low operating costs, short-field performance, and ruggedness of a turboprop. The A-29, in particular, has been enormously successful in carving out a niche for itself in the turboprop counterinsurgency/light attack segment, winning orders from customers across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere in Asia, with some of these customers having taken it into combat. This marketplace is also increasingly occupied by drones, although there is still a broader requirement for manned aircraft that benefit from what humans in the cockpit bring to counterinsurgency and close air support scenarios in terms of situational awareness. Furthermore, combat-capable unmanned aircraft generally remain a higher-end option, with significant demands in terms of infrastructure and training. The costs involved also mean that a manned platform is often a far more accessible path to fielding an airborne counterinsurgency and lower-end close air support capability. Manned and unmanned platforms are usually most effective in these roles when paired together. With that in mind, Asian or African nations engaged in this type of warfare might be tempted to look at the Calidus design, providing that they don’t face a significant threat from hostile air defenses, against which even a high-flying B-350 would be potentially vulnerable. That said, the B-350 does at least appear to have provision for some kind of self-protection suite, with mountings for missile approach warning sensors visible on the fuselage, and launchers for infrared flares would seem likely, at the very least. The tandem twin-seat cockpit of the B-350 mock-up., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Bearing in mind the increase in performance and payload, and potentially loiter time, over existing light attack platforms, the B-350 might instead find itself facing competition from ‘medium’ attack aircraft such as the Sierra Nevada Corporation MC-145B Wily Coyote . On the other hand, the Emirati design is unique as a heavy single-turboprop design optimized for this kind of work. A potential point in favor of B-350 exports is that the aircraft will likely be free of systems covered by the U.S.-imposed International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) framework , under which the U.S. Department of State can restrict exports to certain countries. The B-250 was developed to be ITAR-free, and the same will probably be the case for the B-350, hence the locally made munitions on display alongside the mock-up. However, the manufacturer has so far remained tight-lipped about either internal requirements or export prospects, and we really don’t know how far this project has progressed, beyond the mock-up on show in Dubai. According to CHARVÁT AXL, that company signed a contract, apparently in 2020, to deliver landing gear kits for three flying prototypes of the B-350 within three years, with the first set to be delivered within 18 months. If that’s the case, we might not have to wait long to see a real B-350, by which time Calidus will hopefully have revealed more about its plans for this intriguing giant.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 4, 2021",Israel Aerospace Industries Says This Is The Next Leap In Exportable Electronic Warfare Systems,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has unveiled two new additions to its electronic warfare systems portfolio, designed to provide protection against a wide range of threats on land and at sea. The latest iterations of the Scorpius system are based on active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology, harnessing its various advantages to provide what the company claims is a new type of soft-kill capability in the land-based and maritime domains. IAI officially announced the existence of the new Scorpius G (ground-based) and Scorpius N (naval) systems on Thursday, November 11, and The War Zone spoke to Gideon Fostick, director of marketing for the Intelligence, Communications and EW division of IAI’s Elta Systems subsidiary to find out more. The latest products are derived from technologies used in two previous airborne pods , the Scorpius SP (self-protection) and SJ (standoff jammer), as well as a ground-based training version, the Scorpius T. An artist’s conception of the ground-based Scorpius G engaging an enemy fighter, AWACS plane, and drone, using its AESA-based electronic attack beams., IAI The Scorpius electronic warfare (EW) systems are designed to target multiple threats simultaneously, using jamming to disrupt the radio frequencies used by those systems. Because of the AESA technology behind it, these kinds of systems are readily scalable and, once scaled up, are able to provide a defensive bubble around a much wider area, sufficient to defend a warship against long-range anti-ship missiles, for instance, or to protect an armored column on the move. “You can detect anything that’s happening all over the sky, even tens or hundreds of targets and you can send each one of them a dedicated narrow jamming beam,” Fostick explains. “Instead of targeting a single or just a couple of targets, you can now detect and address and disable [multiple targets].” The concept of attacking enemy systems with electronic means, or radio waves, has been around for a very long time, but up until now, this typically involved specific limitations. Using a traditional dish antenna meant pointing it in the direction of the threat emitter, before moving it to engage a different target. This limited engagements to a very small number of targets at a given moment, something that AESA can overcome. The advantages of AESA radar technology are something that we have discussed in depth in the past and it’s something we often hear about in relation to airborne radars . Fundamentally, an AESA system uses a flat array and can simultaneously send multiple narrow beams in many directions, using an array of transceivers. Using an AESA array for this kind of EW application is not unique to IAI, with the U.S. Navy’s AN/SLQ-32(V)7 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program Block III, or SEWIP Block III, is also using an advanced set of AESA arrays to make highly precise electronic attacks on multiple targets at once, and to act as secondary sensors and even communications nodes. You can read all about the capabilities of that system here . IAI of course has a long history of developing AESA radars for all kinds of applications, including as part of the Iron Dome air defense system that featured so prominently in the last Gaza conflict . This technology is now being developed in another direction altogether, in the form of the Scorpius family of EW systems. The Iron Dome system in action during tests last year: At the heart of Scorpius is taking the advantages of AESA and then optimizing those for the purpose of electronic attack. In this way, the EW system can benefit from the increased range provided by an AESA antenna and its ability to scan for threats in directions simultaneously. Then, in response, Scorpius uses the same technology to send narrowly focused beams to interfere with multiple threats across a broad swathe of the electromagnetic spectrum. Typical threats include manned aircraft, air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles, cruise missiles, smaller drones , and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). As Fostick explains “basically anything that’s in your line of sight that uses the spectrum somehow.” That could include the radar, electronic sensors, navigation systems, and data communications employed by those threat platforms. Fostick claims the receiver sensitivity and transmission power of Scorpius are so great that the system essentially represents a “whole new category of product.” Looking at the two newly unveiled systems in more detail, the Scorpius G is a mobile EW system that’s mounted on a truck, in its initial form. It uses an AESA system used to detect and disrupt ground and airborne threats. Fostick describes the Scorpius G as “the most groundbreaking application” in the family, due to its ability to defend “a region, a battlefield” against a full range of modern threats, including cruise missiles and small-size attack drones . https://youtube.com/watch?v=TBWiPhnbiSg Since these kinds of threats usually use some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to navigate, communicate, or to sense what’s going on around them, the opportunity exists to disrupt them. While IAI has not disclosed the range at which the Scorpius G system is effective, Fostick says that threats can be addressed “from much farther distances” than is possible with legacy jamming systems. It’s notable, of course, that Scorpius G (and associated products) offer a means of air defense that does not rely on a hard kill. The ability to defend against incoming threats without employing a gun, missile, or even a laser is especially relevant in urban environments or when there are troops in the open or soft-skinned vehicles in the vicinity. While Scorpius G is currently mounted on a truck, the system, in general, is designed to be highly modular and Fostick says that it’s conceivable that it could be installed at different sizes, weights, and complexities on platforms of varying size and capacity. Clearly, if it could be scaled down small enough, it could even provide protection to a single vehicle, or could be installed on one vehicle to protect a larger convoy. The maritime-optimized Scorpius N is intended to defend warships against advanced threats, including cruise missiles, drones, and airborne imaging radars. Here, the particular advantage offered by AESA technology is the ability to tackle threats at a longer range than was normally possible in the past. A computer-generated artwork showing the naval Scorpius N protecting a smaller warship., IAI “Naval EW is pretty tricky,” Fostick admits. “If a missile is coming at you and you’ve got this huge ship [to defend], it’s pretty difficult to confuse it. The only way to really be able to do that is to destroy it at longer ranges. Scorpius technology, by having these multiple narrow beams, dramatically increases the range at which you can detect that missile coming at you and act to confuse and deflect it. It’s really effective in defending a vessel in a way that would previously require a huge system.” The reduction in equipment size that AESA also offers means that Scorpius N can be installed on a frigate “easily,” while integration on a corvette is “possible.” Already on the market is the Scorpius T that provides EW training for pilots, emulating a variety of modern air-defense systems simultaneously and intended to challenge even fifth-generation aircraft, a growing concern for air forces around the world. It also reflects the increasing demand for threat emulators in general, as operators seek to inject more realism into aerial combat training, exposing pilots to threatening emissions associated with a wide array of potential enemy air defense systems . Scorpius T made its public debut during the international Blue Flag air combat exercise that took place in Israel last month. “We believe it’s the only system in the world today that can effectively train pilots of modern fifth-generation aircraft,” Fostick says. Here, the AESA technology is used to generate multiple different air defense threats to challenge different aircraft, for an enriched training experience that would be hard, or even impossible, for older systems to achieve. “The pilot flying in the air suddenly gets that buzz, that alarm in their cockpit telling them that they are being targeted by the most advanced air defense systems existing in the world today,” Fostick explains. “I was told by pilots participating in the exercise that it really gets you, you feel the threat out there and then you have to perform your evasive maneuvers , or chaff , or all kinds of other protection techniques.’ At the same time, Scorpius T records everything that is happening to help with a debriefing at the end of the mission. “The system itself is mobile, you can shift it from place to place, the advantage being you can change up the training scenario, otherwise you’re getting used to doing the same thing every time,” Fostick adds. “If you want, you can emulate multiple systems from the same point. In that sense, it’s a huge saving and logistical advantage versus previous expensive and cumbersome systems, each of which only emulated a single threat.” And, since Scorpius T is digital-based, it can be quickly updated to emulate newer threats as they become relevant. Finally, there is the airborne Scorpius SP/SJ for combat aircraft, offering either an autonomous self-protection capability or standoff jamming to protect a formation of friendly aircraft against enemy air and ground-based threats. In its basic form, the airborne Scorpius is pod-mounted and entirely self-contained, but it can also be installed on transport aircraft or, potentially, on drones. The podded airborne version of the Scorpius EW system., IAI The airborne Scorpius would seem to have an immediate application for the growing adversary air community , as a means of challenging fifth-generation aircraft , in particular, during red air simulated combat. Fostick notes that the adversary air market is one of those that IAI is targeting and it is an area where Israel has already featured prominently, including supplying EW equipment to U.S. aggressor units, while different air arms around the world use similar systems for self-protection during operational missions . As of today, actual Scorpius hardware has been sold to what Fostick describes as “several prominent customers across the world,” with several applications having been ordered — this would imply both the airborne pod and the Scorpius T training aid are now in use. The newly announced Scorpius G and N exist currently as “actual working systems,” which are said to be close to operational use, but there have been no orders announced so far. IAI’s activity in bringing new versions of Scorpius to market reflects a growing realization about the advantages inherent in AESA technology, and the ability to spiral this into different development paths. The company’s Elta division was well placed to leverage the work already achieved in AESA radars for an EW application, although adapting it to this new role was not necessarily straightforward, as Fostick explains” “There is a huge difference between radar and EW. With AESA radar, the radar operator selects the frequency. But for EW, you need to engage an enemy who is using any possible frequency across the spectrum, so you need to be able to have multiple shifting beams operating over a very, very wide band. Getting AESA to work across a huge bandwidth of threat frequencies was a huge technological leap.” With its modular design, the different Scorpius iterations can be adapted in terms of size, complexity, and autonomy. These options will be reflected in the cost of the system, but Fostick says it falls within the “same price ballpark as previous systems.” There is also a persistent discussion about the potential for AESA systems like Scorpius to be tuned to cause actual physical damage, using bursts of energy. The types of powerful AESA radar sets that are becoming widespread on modern combat aircraft, for example, are known to have a secondary non-kinetic attack capability , employing high-power pencil-sized beams of electromagnetic energy to disable enemy missile and air defense-related electronics. Although there is no confirmation of this capability in relation to Scorpius, it would clearly add another powerful facet to knock out threat emitters. Further development of Scorpius only reinforces the fact that the electromagnetic spectrum is fast becoming a preeminent domain at the center of modern warfare . Every field of conflict is likely to see forces seeking to exploit the spectrum for their own needs while simultaneously trying to deny the enemy from doing the same like never before. The Scorpius presents one potential way of addressing the challenging requirement of achieving electronic dominance. Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2021",Russia Claims Flying Prototypes Of Its New Checkmate Fighter Are Now Under Construction,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Developments in the Sukhoi Checkmate new-generation single-engine fighter program are now coming in rapid succession, with the announcement that the first flying prototypes are now under construction. At the same time, there are reports in the Russian media of talks on selling the jet to the Russian military, while officials are also hopeful that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could become more deeply involved in the program. The Checkmate is currently making its foreign debut at the Dubai Airshow where officials from the United Aircraft Corporation, the conglomerate responsible for the Sukhoi design bureau, have been talking up the prospects of the new fighter . This is all part of an extensive public relations drive that included a glitzy presentation ceremony in Dubai and even the launch of a signature perfume to accompany the jet’s appearance. UAC Potentially most critical to the future of the Checkmate is the revelation that more than one flying prototype is now under construction at UAC’s KnAAPO facility in the manufacturing plant at Komsomolsk-on-Amur, which also builds certain members of the Sukhoi Flanker multirole fighter family and the more advanced Su-57 Felon . This fact was confirmed by Yuri Slyusar, General Director of UAC. “I would like to hint that the plant at Komsomolsk has started to build a few prototypes for the starting batch,” Yuri Slyusar told reporters after yesterday’s presentation ceremony, according to Aviation Week’s Steve Trimble. This revelation suggests that the Checkmate on display in Dubai, and which was previously unveiled at the opening of the MAKS international air show at Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, in July, is an accurate full-scale mockup, rather than a flight-capable demonstrator. It was recently intimated by officials that the display article would be converted into a flying demonstrator. The first-ever official appearance of the Checkmate at MAKS 2021 in July., ROSTEC Meanwhile, Russia’s TASS state-run news agency, which recently published new details about the Checkmate’s specifications, today reported that discussions have been held between the Russian Ministry of Defense and Rostec, the country’s state-run industrial conglomerate, with a view to selling the fighter to the Russian military. According to TASS, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov told reporters at Dubai that talks involved “the outlook for the deliveries of the Checkmate single-engine fifth-generation fighter jet to the [Russian] armed forces.” “They wanted to have some, of course,” Chemezov said. “We recently discussed with the minister [of defense] that they need to come up with mission requirements stating what configuration they are looking for in the jet,” he added. “The configuration that we have made now was funded by us and the Russian Industry and Trade Ministry.” This is the first official signal that the Russian Ministry of Defense may be interested in acquiring the Checkmate which had previously been marketed primarily as an export product. Furthermore, Moscow has almost given up on purchases of lightweight and medium-weight fighters in favor of the Flanker family and, more recently, the Su-57. Indeed, Moscow has not bought a single-engine fighter jet of any kind since the mid-1980s, when the MiG-23, MiG-27, and Su-17 were still in production, and surviving examples of these were all disposed of by frontline unit by the mid-1990s. Visitors to the Dubai Airshow view a presentation about the Su-57., UAC Intriguingly, it could be the case that the ministry of defense is actually looking at acquiring an unmanned version of the Checkmate, rather than the manned fighter. Chemezov said that the jet “may be converted into a UAV,” further noting that “There’s great interest in UAVs at the moment.” UAC has recently raised the prospect of pilot-optional and unmanned Checkmate variants and last week TASS presented a digital rendering of an unmanned version of the Checkmate: An unmanned Checkmate accompanies a manned version in this TASS rendering., TASS As for the purported UAE connection, this dates back at least to the IDEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi in 2017, when Rostec signed a memorandum of understanding with the UAE on the co-development of a “fifth-generation light fighter.” At the time it was not clear whether this involved a clean-sheet fighter design or a further development of the MiG-35 Fulcrum family. Subsequently, a marketing video for the Checkmate released ahead of MAKS 2021 featured “air force pilots” from various nations, including the Emirates. At the airshow in Moscow, the UAE was identified as one of the territories targeted by the marketing campaign. Now, according to Aviation Week , there’s hope that the UAE will become more deeply involved in the program. “I believe that by the end of the exhibition, I will be able to tell you something more definite on the issue,” Slyusar said. The UAE fighter fleet is currently based around the F-16E/F Block 60 Desert Falcon and the Mirage 2000-9DAD/EAD, with upgrade programs for both types in the works. A UAE Air Force Mirage 2000-9EAD fighter jet., U.S. AIR FORCE Beyond that, the UAE has plans to buy around 60 new fighters, at a cost of around $6 billion. In November last year, the U.S. State Department approved the possible Foreign Military Sale of as many as 50 F-35A stealth fighters as part of a package of arms valued at up to $23.37 billion. No firm contracts have been signed, however, and it’s possible the Checkmate could fill the requirement. What’s more, UAC boasts a unit price of just $30 million compared to around $90 million for the F-35. This is very much the starting price for the Checkmate, however, and the actual price tag will “vary depending on the configuration.” As we have observed in the recent past , however, the possibility of actually hitting this price point seems very far-fetched, at this stage. The parent company also seems to be making a fairly deliberate pitch to Turkey, which has previously been linked with both the Su-35 and the Su-57 , although Ankara is also pursuing its own advanced indigenous fighter project . A video uploaded to the UAC website to coincide with the Dubai Airshow shows a Checkmate flying over a line-up of F-16 and F-4 fighters, a combination currently flown by Turkey. The same video includes an aerial engagement with an F-35, as well as an apparent reference to the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) that serves as the information infrastructure for the F-35 and which has had various well-publicized difficulties, especially for foreign operators , and which is now slated for replacement . A sequence in the new video shows a Checkmate as well as F-16s and F-4s., UAC Another still from the video, with a tablet showing an error message when an operator attempts to replenish weapons stocks, in an apparent dig at ALIS., UAC Amid all the hype, the matter of cost is just one of the questions that still surround this program. After all, the Checkmate appeared essentially out of nowhere amid a blaze of largely unconventional hype , and, so far, we have yet to see any actual, real hardware. On the other hand, if these latest statements check out, it would seem that this new fighter is at least heading toward flight testing. With the prospect of potential customer interest at home and aboard, the Checkmate might have a fighting chance at becoming an operational reality.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 15, 2021",Latest Images Of Russia’s Checkmate Fighter Shows Us Just How Big It Really Is (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some four months since it was officially unveiled , another glut of promotional material has been released relating to the Sukhoi Checkmate ahead of its official foreign debut at the Dubai Airshow next week. Also known as the Light Tactical Aircraft, or LTS in Russian, what we’ve seen now reveals a fighter that’s substantially bigger than we might have imagined, at least in comparison to the Su-57 Felon . Seeing the two planes alongside each other provides our best view so far of the enigmatic Checkmate fighter project and evidence that this is really more of a medium fighter than a true light combat jet. The comparison between the single-engine Checkmate and the twin-engine Su-57 reveals a lot about the new project, especially in terms of the features that are similar. Most remarkable, perhaps, is the relationship in size between the Su-57 — always seen as a heavyweight potential successor to the Sukhoi Flanker family — and the Checkmate, that’s officially described as a Light Tactical Aircraft. Published data indicate that the Checkmate is approximately 57 feet long with a wingspan of 39 feet, compared to equivalent figures of 66 feet and 46 feet for the Felon. An artist’s digital representation of the Sukhoi Checkmate., TASS Clearly, both Sukhoi designs are optimized for a ‘balanced’ degree of low visibility—you can read all about what that actually means here . Both aircraft incorporate blended-body configurations with a lift-generating fuselage, and wing leading-edge root extensions (LERXes), although those on the Su-57 are much larger, incorporating large moving flaps. The wing profile of the new fighter is also very similar to that of the Felon, at least when seen from outboard of the LERXes. pic.twitter.com/uxUMiuCbOu — 明太祖朱元璋 (@onceggyyy) November 11, 2021 Some great comparison shots of the Sukhoi LTS / S-75 ""CheckMate"" and the Su-57 (via 'helmutkohl' from the SecretProjectsForum) @Strike_Flanker @CombatAir pic.twitter.com/dFvY7Yapgs — @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) November 11, 2021 Except for some minor differences at the wing tip and inboard flap, the outboard wing panel of each aircraft is the same.

On the Checkmate, the tailerons are also combined with stub-like horizontal tail surfaces on either side of the engine exhaust, used for additional pitch control. The engine of the Checkmate remains mysterious, however, and it’s unclear if a real powerplant is installed in the demonstrator, although the nozzle, at least, appears to be the real thing. The engine is rumored to be a version of the Izdeliye 30 that’s planned as the definitive powerplant for the Su-57, but which has yet to appear on in-service aircraft. On the other hand, the published thrust figures of 14,500-16,000 kilograms for the Checkmate engine would suggest a lower-rated unit than the Izdeliye 30, or at least a down-rated version of this powerplant. Maneuverability would still be a primary driver with the design, so 3D thrust vectoring would also be included at least as an option, and even possibly by default. TASS published a promotional video of the Sukhoi Checkmate fighter for its foreign debut at the Dubai Airshow. 55/ https://t.co/VBESbjLSpR pic.twitter.com/8Us28Oiocz — Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 12, 2021 Data published by Russia’s TASS state-run news agency provides some additional details of the planned performance of the Checkmate, including a maximum speed of 2,200km/h (1,367mph) and a range of 2,800km (1,740 miles), which is a little reduced compared to previously announced figures. We also now know that this maximum range would be achieved through the use of external fuel tanks or what its actual combat radius would be in various configurations. Described as being unique for its class, the weapons load of the Checkmate is stated as 7,400kg (16,314lb), which will include stores carried on five internal hardpoints (located within three weapons bays) as well as six more pylons located externally. Overall, it’s easy to see that the Checkmate is very much a medium fighter, not some light fighter design. With significant internal fuel volume, its ability to fly longer combat missions over greater distances while remaining in its stealthiest state could be a major selling point. A diagram showing the three internal weapons bays plus four of the external pylons., TASS The cockpits and radomes of the respective fighters also show broad similarities, suggesting that there may be a substantial degree of community in terms of the cockpit avionics and the radar. This is something we predicted when the fighter first emerged. This makes sense in terms of reducing development costs and the burden on the extensive flight-test program once the Checkmate gets into the air. It would also lower costs for both platforms. This tallies with the TASS report, which notes that “to reduce the cost of a copy and simplify maintenance, the cockpit, and on-board systems and some of the Checkmate elements are unified” with those of the Su-57. The Checkmate during its official unveiling in July., ROSTEC Another interesting aspect of the TASS report is the declaration that Sukhoi designed the Checkmate, in part, on the basis of combat experience gathered in Syria. The Russian campaign in that country has involved all its main combat aircraft types , including a brief evaluation by the Su-57 . Drawing upon the Syrian experience, the designers “thought about creating a light single-engine aircraft in 2016  […] Analysis of the results of the use of strike aircraft systems in Syria showed that for most tasks, the capabilities of heavy twin-engine aircraft systems are excessive,” Mikhail Strelets, chief designer of the Checkmate told TASS . Official video of the brief Su-57 combat evaluation in Syria: With the Checkmate set to make its first international appearance at the Dubai Airshow that begins on Sunday, other officials have been talking up the export prospects of the jet as well as providing some hints of how they hope the program will develop in the future. The United Aircraft Corporation , which is responsible for the Sukhoi design bureau, has been talking up the possibility of pilot-optional and unmanned Checkmate variants as it works toward getting a prototype into the air. According to Yuri Slyusar, General Director of UAC: The aircraft was originally created as a platform for a whole family of aviation complexes. We are planning to create an optionally manned and unmanned aircraft modification. Unmanned modification is not just a tribute to fashion. Already at an early stage of the project, we lay in it ample opportunities for use in network-centric military operations. The aircraft will be able to exchange information and direct other aviation complexes and unmanned aerial vehicles to targets. The use of unmanned versions of the machine will allow, among other things, to implement new tactical techniques On the back of that suggestion from Slyusar, TASS has provided this rendering of an unmanned version of the Checkmate: TASS There has also been talk of other potential versions, including a two-seater, which would seem to mirror the recent appearance of a twin-place variant of China’s J-20 stealth fighter — although in that case, a real flying prototype has materialized. All these aspirations, however, will come to nothing without one or more customers for the Checkmate. So far, the response from the Russian Ministry of Defense seems to have been lukewarm, and its interest in lightweight , or even medium-weight fighters , has been limited in recent years. With that in mind, customers for the new fighter will likely have to be found further afield. Sergey Chemezov, General Director of Rostec State Corporation, told TASS : “Machines of this class are really in high demand on the world military equipment market. The unique combination of flight characteristics, combat effectiveness at an affordable price should make the Russian single-engine fighter popular on the international arms market.” TASS The plan to offer the Checkmate at a unit cost of $30 million had been announced before, in comparison to around $90 million for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter . This is also roughly half the cost (or more, depending on where you look) for a new F-16. More remarkably, TASS also states that the Checkmate will come in even cheaper than the JF-17 Thunder ($55.33 million), very much a “no-frills” fighter, at least in comparison to the Sukhoi product. Cost, however, will “vary depending on the configuration” and this is clearly the starting point for an austere version. Even then, it is downright puzzling how Sukhoi could deliver this jet at anywhere near that cost. Potential customers are being sought in the Middle East, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America, which is in keeping with the nations highlighted in this early promotional video for the Checkmate before the demonstrator was revealed: https://youtube.com/watch?v=u-OZZKnjhRI It’s important to note that the actual status of the Checkmate display article that we’ve seen to date remains obscure. There have been suggestions that it’s a full-scale mockup, designed to provide an idea of how the real plane will look. Others have posited that the degree of realism suggests it is at least some kind of demonstrator, perhaps capable of being taxied, provided it’s fitted with an engine. More recently, it’s been intimated it will be transformed in the future into a true flying prototype. And here’s the Sukhoi Checkmate stealth fighter model at the Dubai Airshow. 51/ https://t.co/c7xDycguVr pic.twitter.com/kyK0m0u3XX — Rob Lee (@RALee85) November 9, 2021 It might be hoped that observers in Dubai will be able to get a closer look at the aircraft and be able to figure out whether it has a powerplant installed as well as other critical systems that would be required for flight testing. It’s possible officials at the show will also provide more details as to its actual disposition. In the meantime, however, the hardware that has emerged in support of the Checkmate program, impressive as it looks, remains very firmly on the ground. UPDATE: Now, as if the marketing behind the Checkmate couldn’t have gotten any weirder , there is now a Checkmate fragrance! UPDATE: Some new product card details here, not much we don’t already know. A few interesting tidbits: 8G design 1740 miles range with a full internal combat load. That would be roughly an 870-mile combat radius, which is very large for a single-engine design. #Checkmate #LTS #DubaiAirshow2021 pic.twitter.com/gIi5CZZEaI — Michael Jerdev (@MuxelAero) November 14, 2021 LTS Chekmate presentation and Mr. Slusar Q&A session. #DubaiAirShow2021 #UAC #Checkmate pic.twitter.com/pINFBWZ4tY — Michael Jerdev (@MuxelAero) November 14, 2021 UPDATE: New developments on Checkmate out of Dubai can be read about in our new post linked here.

Now, thanks to our friends @CJR1321 and @Warshipcam , we get to see them like never before. The image above looks like a scene out of some remake or Miami Vice or Thunder In Paradise , with three CCAs racing in near-perfect formation across a glistening San Diego Bay. The Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen, better known as SWCCs, helm these fast boats, which provide a multi-purpose platform for special operations in medium-risk environments. This primarily includes acting as a seagoing chariot for Navy SEALs and other special operators from across the services. They have stealthy features, like their retractable low-observable sensor and communications masts, and can be configured in different ways to accomplish their varied missions. This includes having machine guns and grenade launchers installed or armor plating flipped into place. Maybe what’s most interesting about the CCA is all the ways it can be deployed. We have seen these boats dropped out of C-17s, carried off to parts unknown aboard Special Operations Command’s shadowy mothership , and sling loaded into action by MH-47 Chinooks flown by the 160th SOAR Night Stalkers. They operate from the well-decks of amphibious assault ships. So, we are talking about some very versatile boats here. You can read much more about the CCAs in this past piece of ours .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force B-52H bomber has been damaged during an incident earlier today on the ground at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The exact circumstances of the accident are unknown, but a report indicates that the aircraft’s right wing hit a fence while it was being positioned for a static display. A picture, seen below, reportedly showing a redacted Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) Notification Worksheet regarding this mishap appeared today on the unofficial Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook group. Barksdale’s public affairs office confirmed to The War Zone that an incident involving a B-52H had occurred at the base, but no other details are yet being released. Barksdale is home to the active-duty 2nd Bomb Wing and the Air Force Reserve’s 343rd Bomb Wing. “While positioning the aircraft for static display on the site, the aircraft collided with the fence directly in front of the MXG [maintenance] building,” the notice, which says it was submitted by the 2nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (2 AMXS), reads. “No personnel were reported injured. All pieces were recovered from the fence and the aircraft and there is significant damage to the right wing tip and the leading edge wing outboard of the right external tank.” There is no explanation given for the purpose of this static display. Bombers at the base are posed from time to time for public relations and other purposes . The actual extent of the damage remains to be seen, but if it is indeed substantial, it could be costly and time-consuming to repair the bomber. The last B-52Hs rolled off the production line in 1962. The Air Force currently has 76 of these bombers still in service, along with a small handful of additional surplus airframes in storage at the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Updated 5:35 PM EST: Pictures have now appeared on the Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook page reportedly showing the damage to the B-52H’s wing after the mishap at Barksdale earlier today. What we can see in these photographs is consistent with the information in the Notification Worksheet that had previously emerged.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jet was spotted carrying an AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s Eye radar pod during a recent sortie over the Red Sea with Air Force B-1B bombers and Royal Saudi Air Force F-15 fighters . This appears to be the first time this combination has been seen in the region and highlights how this pod, originally designed to be carried by Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles , has now become an operational tool for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Vipers. The pod offers a way to quickly give F-16s significant additional all-weather targeting and surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities when required. A total of two F-16Cs, a pair of B-1Bs, and four Saudi F-15s flew together to demonstrate “commitment to partners and regional stability” yesterday, according to the Air Force . The Dragon’s Eye pod is visible underneath one of the Vipers in a picture from this mission that the Saudi Ministry of Defense released, a crop of which is seen at the top of this story and the full version of which is seen below. It’s not entirely clear what unit the Vipers belong to, but the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s 115th Fighter Wing sent some of these jets and around 300 personnel to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia for a scheduled deployment in October. The F-16C carrying the Dragon’s Eye Pod is visible at the top left of this photograph., Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defense That the Viper in question belongs to an Air National Guard unit makes good sense. The Air Force announced in September 2020 that at least 200 F-16C/Ds in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve had been upgraded to be able to carry this radar pod. Work to integrate Dragon’s Eye onto these jets dates back to at least 2018 . The Dragon’s Eye pod is just barely visible on the F-16C at right in this picture that the US Air Force released from the mission over the Red Sea yesterday., USAF Dragon’s Eye is a powerful sensor system that has an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar at its core that is capable of being rotated around the pod’s center axis. The pod also contains geo-positioning and cooling systems. The radar has synthetic aperture functionality allowing it to produce high-fidelity imagery of a large area and is said to be sensitive enough to detect small and even shallow-buried objects, such as individual people and improvised explosive devices. It reportedly has ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) capabilities, as well, giving it the ability to track moving vehicles and ships below. What this all means is that system can be used to conduct general intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and collect targeting data for actual strikes, all at extended ranges and in any weather conditions. An F-15E Strike Eagle carrying a Dragon’s Eye pod, indicated by a white arrow, among other stores., USAF This is hardly the first time that Air Force aircraft have been seen carrying the pod in the Middle East, but previously it had been almost exclusively associated with the F-15E . The service’s F-15E fleet is small compared to how many F-16s it has, and the Strike Eagles are in high demand . So enabling Vipers to carry Dragon’s Eye expands the total number of platforms that can carry the system, offering greater operational flexibility, on top of just giving individual jets a major boost in capability. Many Air National Guard F-16C/Ds are separately in the process of receiving new, highly capable AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radars (SABR), another AESA type. Pairing Dragon’s Eye and SABR together would produce a very impressive set of capabilities, though it’s not clear if this particular Viper carrying the pod over the Red Sea yesterday has a new AN/APG-83. The focus of this mission yesterday appears to have mostly been about highlighting partnerships between the U.S. military and its Saudi counterparts. The Red Sea is a highly strategic body of water where the Dragon’s Eye pod could have real operational utility. It lies between two major chokepoints, the Suez Canal to the North and the Bab Al Mandeb Strait to the south. An accident involving the container ship Ever Given left the Suez Canal blocked off for six days earlier this year and underscored how even relatively short disruption of commercial shipping in this region could have major negative economic impacts worldwide. Accidents aren’t the only potential threats to unfettered maritime movement and general security in this part of the world. Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen regularly launch attacks on commercial interests in Saudi Arabia, including against ships in the southern Red Sea and facilities along the coast there, in addition to military targets. There have been concerns in recent years that this group, and Iran itself, may be expanding its ability to strike farther north , including at targets in southern Israel . Iran, or at least proxies acting on its behalf, have launched a number of attacks on commercial ships in the Middle East in recent years , including vessels tied to Israel as part of a maritime shadow war those countries have been waging against each other . F-16s with Dragon’s Eye pods would be able to help keep an eye out for potentially hostile activity in and around the Red Sea, as well as help execute strikes on threats that pop up and conduct damage assessment after any such operations. The AN/ASQ-236 presents a particularly ideal tool for spotting and targeting small boat swarms, no matter what the weather down below might be like. Iran and its proxies routinely demonstrate how swarms of small boats are a very real threat in the region, as is highlighted in the video footage below from a recent altercation in the Gulf of Oman. Flying from Prince Sultan Air Base, which is situated in central Saudi Arabia closer to the Persian Gulf, Vipers with these radar pods could perform similar missions elsewhere in the region, which has no shortage of potential hotspots . With hundreds of Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Vipers now capable of carrying Dragon’s Eye, seeing jets in the Middle East, as well as other locales, will likely only become ever more routine.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 17, 2021",China Is Using E-3 Sentry Mockups For Targets On Its Ballistic Missile Impact Range,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Concerns over China’s rapidly evolving high-end military capabilities have hit a crescendo in recent weeks. The massive expansion of its strategic arsenal , the test of a fractional orbital bombardment-like system , the emergence of a two-seat J-20 and carrier-capable FC-31 derivative — both stealth fighters — along with the real potential for new, more advanced combat aircraft types on the horizon , are just some the developments that have grabbed headlines as of late. Even more recently, the discovery of massive moving targets in China’s vast desert expanse that emulate American warships has added to the pile. Many of these revelations came via the use of satellite imagery. What was the niche of just a few of us OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)-focused reporters has become a race to identify anything new pertaining to China’s military developmental activities via spacial imaging — for better or worse. Some of these ‘discoveries’ are far more mundane or even misanalyzed than others, but more eyes on the case are always better than less. Now, we would like to add another entry to this ongoing public space imaging intel feeding frenzy — China’s apparent use of two E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) mockups on its impact range used for testing advanced missile technology. Images The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs (seen at the top of this article) dated Aug. 28, 2021, show two full-size E-3 mockups sitting on the main runway-like target that is part of one of the most well-established weapons testing range complexes in China’s Gobi Desert. It’s the same area that saw the emergence of ship and pier-like shapes used for ballistic missile development in the last decade and a half. Today, many of those features have been dismantled as the aforementioned higher fidelity targets have taken their place in the same general region. A wide shot of the range complex from the middle of the last decade shows the now largely dismantled ship and pier-like targets as well as the same large runway-like features and support buildings that remain today., Google Earth After we found the E-3 mockups, we searched to see how long they had been there. In those efforts, we came across a report from the Center For A New America Security by Thomas H. Shugart III that was released in February 2021. It pointed out one faux E-3 located on the impact range. It isn’t clear how long the mock Sentry has been there, but based on our review of low-resolution satellite imagery, it is likely a number of years, with the second one arriving much more recently. Nobody does full-scale mockups of potential foes’ infrastructure and assets like China. Their largest base is used for high-fidelity training and includes a full-scale representation of Taiwan’s Presidential Office Building. They have done the same with target airfields that perfectly match those in Taiwan, as well as many other high-fidelity recreations, some of which are quite puzzling. You can read all about these in this past post of ours. Mockups overall are sort of a thing in modern Chinese culture, so the fact that it is taken to the next level by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is somewhat logical. The inclusion specifically of the E-3 Sentry on one of China’s primary impact targets in the Gobi Desert makes total sense. E-3s would be among the highest priority targets for Chinese long-range missiles, and especially for its ever-evolving standoff missile capabilities. The best way to kill any aircraft during a conflict is on the ground. The E-3s — just 31 of which are in the USAF’s inventory — are massive force multipliers. They underpin America’s tactical air combat strategy and work as critical command-and-control and surveillance nodes and enablers for tactical airpower. Destroying the E-3s, and other lumbering support assets , would go a long way toward neutering American advantages in air-to-air combat and situational awareness over the battlefield. With this in mind, China has developed a heavy stealth fighter and very long-range air-to-air missiles to help execute such a strategy in the air, but killing U.S. aircraft before they can even get off the ground remains the best course of action. The E-3s, which are derived from the long out-of-production Boeing 707 airliner, are finicky and geriatric machines, something the U.S. Air Force is well aware of , so the opportunity to kill any of them on the ground could be even richer than some of their younger counterparts. This would be a top priority for the PLA’s missile units during the opening stages of an actual shooting war. The same can be said for other critical, high-value, low-density support assets, some of which, like the E-8 JSTARS and RC-135 family of aircraft , are also based on the 707 and its military cousin, the C-135. In fact, China itself is a true believer in the AWACS concept. It has poured huge sums of money into developing a remarkable range of airborne early warning types. They are more plentiful than U.S. stocks and many are smaller than their American counterparts, using turboprop propulsion that can allow them to operate out of smaller airfields. So, it’s pretty clear just how much China respects this capability and thus would want to kill it to any extent possible during a conflict with the United States. An E-3 Sentry being guarded by armed security forces. , USAF Location is key here, too. What is arguably China’s top U.S. target along the First Island Chain, the sprawling Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, also permanently hosts E-3s . During any major kinetic exchange between the U.S. and China, Kadena would be showered with ballistic missiles and even cruise missiles. Other major fallback bases, such as Andersen Air Force Base on Guam or even Wake Island , could also host Sentries during a crisis, including those from Kadena that could escape in time prior to a missile barrage. E-3s, RC-135s, and KC-135s in their usual spots at Kadena., Google Earth Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. , Google Earth So using a recreation of what would be a primary target within a primary target set for the PLA on this impact range makes perfect sense. This is not just true for full missile testing at the complex, but also for refining the kill chain that ensures those missiles are used most effectively during a barrage. This includes intelligence-gathering capabilities and even refining dynamic targeting sensors, such as those that use imaging infrared or millimetric wave radar, with automated target recognition capabilities. These are often found on various standoff missile types. The thing is, China is fully aware of where the E-3s and other strategic assets are traditionally parked at Kadena, as well as other assets on other bases of interest. That could change during a crisis in hopes of fouling-up fixed target attacks. Thus, China has to develop and adapt its own kill chain to overcome those countermeasures. As the PLA works to refine its standoff weapons systems and the intelligence capabilities needed to employ them effectively, we should see more of these elaborate mockups, not less. E-3s, ships on rails, huge facsimiles of adversary seats of power—are all strange residents of an ever more emboldened China’s desert wastelands.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 11, 2021",China Built A Mothership For Training Its Forces To Defend Against Drone Swarms,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China looks to have launched an odd mini-aircraft carrier of sorts that is intended to launch and recover small aerial drones earlier this year. A model of this catamaran vessel appeared at this year’s Zhuhai Airshow , where it was ostensibly described as a platform for mimicking enemy “electronic” systems during training exercises. This ship will be able to simulate hostile drone swarms, along with other kinds of threats, such as high-volume anti-ship missile strikes and distributed electronic warfare attacks . It also reflects the Chinese military’s interest in operational swarming capabilities , and especially in the maritime domain . Earlier this week, Twitter user @HenriKenhmann , who runs the website East Pendulum , was able to find a picture online of the ship during an apparent launch ceremony in May. The photograph shows an unusual cartoon shark motif painted on the outside of one of the ship’s twin hulls, very similar to what was seen on the model at Zhuhai. This model has received more recent attention as it was displayed alongside one depicting a rail-based training aid that has also turned out to be in operational use, as you can read more about here . A photo that reportedly shows the launch of the ship in question in May 2021. Note the visible cartoon shark motif on the outside of the left hull., Chinese internet The model of the ship shown at the 2021 Zhuhai Airshow., Chinese internet Another picture, seen below, from what would seem to be the same event shows a poster depicting the ship, along with the logo for the state-run China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, or CASIC. The model at Zhuhai was at a CASIC booth. Chinese internet The model of the vessel at Zhuhai depicted it carrying five relatively small tandem-rotor drone helicopters on a large open foredeck in front of the main superstructure. In addition, it showed multiple large antenna domes, which might be associated with high-bandwidth communications systems that would be useful for controlling large groups of unmanned helicopters. The domes were mounting on a large tower on top of the superstructure that would offer a very good location just for positioning line-of-sight control links. As for the drones themselves, the CASIC booth also had a separate model of one of them showing a bar underneath the fuselage with what appears to be some kind of radiofrequency signal emitter installed on either end. What could be other antennas are seen jutting out from the sides of the fuselage and the portly design points to some degree of internal payload capacity. A model of one of the tandem-rotor drone helicopters associated with this catamaran training ship seen at the 2021 Zhuhai Airshow., Chinese internet There was a small sign next to the model at Zhuhai with descriptions of the ship in Chinese and English. Available pictures of the sign do not provide a clear view of all of the English text, but part of it reads “Multifunctional Integrated Electronic Blue Army System.” In Chinese military parlance, mock opponents in training exercises are referred to as the “ Blue Army .” This is in direct contrast to how the U.S. military and other western armed forces describe generic simulated enemies as the “Red Force.” One view of the sign describing the model of this training ship at the 2021 Zhuhai Airshow., Chinese internet Based on this description, and from what we can see of the ship’s design and that of the drones on its deck, it’s not hard to imagine how it might be employed in maritime exercises both far out to sea and in littoral areas. For realistic training against swarms, it would be necessary to sortie lots of drones at once. Beyond that, the unmanned helicopters could pump out signals reflecting the signatures of various kinds of missiles, or even just waves of manned or unmanned aircraft. The rotary-wing drones would be fitted with electronic warfare systems to carry out electronic attacks , as well. All of this would provide a relatively low-cost way to simulate swarms, along with other kinds of aerial threats during drills, and do so across a broad area. The large open decks on the ship in front of and behind the superstructure might provide room for the addition of other capabilities. Catapults or static launchers for fixed-wing drones, including those designed specifically as targets , as well as recovery systems, could be installed in those spaces to expand the kinds of threats the vessel would be to simulate. While the Chinese military is often discussed as a source of these kinds of threats, as a result, it is certainly well aware of the operational risks that drone swarms , advanced anti-ship missiles , and electronic warfare capabilities pose to its own forces. China’s rapid modernization of its armed forces has very much prompted the U.S. military, as well as those of other countries in the Pacific, to work to improve their own capabilities in these same functional areas , especially with respect to future high-end maritime conflicts . At the same time, it’s not at all hard to see how this vessel could be a stepping stone to an actual operational capability, if it doesn’t simply reflect systems already in service clandestinely now. China has made steady advances in recent years in the development of drone swarm capabilities , as seen in the video below, often leveraging advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning technology in the process. Small drone carriers operating in conjunction with larger surface action groups could be extremely useful for disrupting enemy maritime operations, both at sea and in the air overhead, during an actual crisis. A ship like this could potentially direct drone swarms at targets ashore or wreak havoc on air defenses, enabling more traditional capabilities to be more effective. Just by themselves, swarms of unmanned aircraft have an inherent ability to confuse and overwhelm enemy forces, making it hard for an opponent to prioritize threats and apply their own resources effectively. In addition, networked swarms offer immense flexibility since individual drones do not need to perform all of the mission sets that the larger group is expected to carry out. As such, any single unmanned aircraft in the swarm might only be configured to carry sensors, electronic warfare systems, or even a small warhead. All of this applies just as much in the maritime domain as it does on land. A swarm could fan out and launch both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks on multiple ships from different vectors at once. A drone with a relatively small warhead could achieve a mission kill on a large warship by targeting key systems, such as radars or communications arrays. The loss of those capabilities could severely limit an enemy vessel’s combat utility until repair could be made and make it far more vulnerable to follow-up attacks. These are all capabilities that the Chinese military is clearly interested in. The state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) showed a video presentation at Zhuhai this year, seen in the Tweet below, depicting flying wing-type drones taking off from the deck of an amphibious assault ship , launching decoys, and then swarming enemy warships with what appear to be electronic warfare attacks. Of course, a dedicated drone carrier would not automatically be necessary to launch drone swarms. China has demonstrated high-volume drone launch systems that could be fitted to virtually any cargo or military vessel and they’re not alone in doing so with an eye toward maritime operations. The U.S. military has been exploring similar capabilities for use on manned surface warships and submarines, as well as unmanned surface and underwater vessels. The threat swarms pose, including to warships, is real very now. Back in 2019, multiple U.S. Navy destroyers were swarmed by drones over a period of a number of nights. As of April of this year, the service said it had still not been able to identify those unmanned aircraft or their operators. As The War Zone has pointed out in great detail , it is likely that intelligence-gathering operations leveraging swarming drone technologies against sensitive U.S. assets are already happening. Above all else, the fact that this catamaran mini-aircraft carrier is not just a model, but is a real mothership to help train against swarms only reinforces how seriously China views this threat as it builds up its naval capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As long as humans have gone to war, history records that animals have gone with them. The Pharoah Ramses II kept a lion as a pet , which joined him in battle against the Hittites. Hannibal’s army of Carthaginians famously crossed the Alps with elephants to attack Rome along a thoroughly unexpected axis. Horses have pulled wagons, carried ammunition, and served not merely as steeds, but as beloved comrades in mounted cavalry . But not all the animals that have accompanied warfighters have served a military purpose — at least not entirely. Dogs, for example, have served not only as protectors as long as they have existed , but also as pets and mascots. On this Veterans Day, many vets will remember their brothers and sisters in arms and sing the old songs and tell the old tales, and many of those tales will also involve, well, tails — the stories of those animal friends who deployed with them or joined unexpectedly, by happenstance — the four-legged animals sent to war or displaced by war and adopted by the men and women in uniform who found them. Then Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert B. Neller poses with Chesty the Bulldog, the Marine Corps Mascot, at the 2018 Marine Corps Birthday Gala in New York. , U.S. Marine Corps / Sgt. Olivia G. Ortiz, USMC A 1996 article in the National Archives newsletter, Prologue , tells the story of quite a few who spent their time with U.S. troops in World War II. Consider Butch, shown here on Iwo Jima in February 1945, watching over a sleeping Private First Class (Pfc) Rez P. Hester of the 7th War Dog Platoon, 25th Regiment. National Archives Butch was an official part of Pfc. Hester’s unit. The kitten in the next image, on the other hand, was found by the Marine in the photo, Corporal Edward Burckhardt, at the foot of Iwo Jima’s Mount Suribachi, also in February 1945. Given the brutality of the months-long fight to take that island — casualty estimates say as many as 27,000 American troops were killed or wounded in the battle — it’s likely there were few smiles anywhere on the island. But this kitten provided at least one Marine a brief respite from the war. Naval History and Heritage Command Sometimes dogs were more than pets — they were comrades-in-arms. Consider Nemo, a German shepherd who served in the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam. On Dec. 5, 1966, Nemo and his handler, Airman 1st Class Robert A. Throneburg, were patrolling Tan Son Nhut Airbase near Saigon, in South Vietnam. Nemo discovered two Viet Cong infiltrators, and a gunfight between the VC and Air Force personnel ensued. Throneburg was wounded in the shoulder and throat, and Nemo received a bullet graze to the snout as well as a shot that cost him an eye. According to dogtime.com : After Throneburg fell unconscious, Nemo crawled on top of the [airman’s] body to protect him from harm. The dog didn’t let anyone touch his fallen handler; it took a veterinarian to remove Nemo (Nemo and Throneburg later recovered from their wounds). Nemo was later given a permanent retirement kennel. Nemo shown with an escort, Airman 2nd Class Melvin Bryant, after his return to the United States., U.S. Air Force Cats have never had any official status in the military (despite military satire website Duffel Blog’s best efforts ).

Navy ships, in particular, seem to have adopted cats, perhaps because they were especially useful in controlling shipboard rodent populations. This (admittedly a little silly) video tells the story of how cats first went down to the sea. In the U.S. Navy, goats have been popular as well. In the days of sailing ships, goats could be a good source of fresh milk, particularly for the officers’ coffee, at least if Patrick O’Brian is to be believed.

Naval History and Heritage Command Taking mascots to a combat zone or adopting stray animals found on deployment is not just a historical habit. Consider, for example, this kitten, stashed in a U.S. soldier’s pocket during an exercise in the Philippines in 2012.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 14, 2021",Space Launch Start-Up Just Used A Giant Centrifuge To Fling A Projectile Into The Upper Atmosphere,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. space launch start-up has, for the first time, demonstrated a kinetic-based system that’s intended one day to put small spacecraft into orbit. The SpinLaunch concept, which feels ripped right from the classic age of science fiction, is based around a vacuum-sealed centrifuge that spins an unpowered projectile at several times the speed of sound before releasing it, hurling it into the upper atmosphere, and ultimately into orbit. In this way, the company, based in Long Beach, Calif., hopes to challenge traditional rockets for putting payloads into space. The first test flight of a prototype — a so-called suborbital accelerator — took place at Spaceport America in New Mexico on October 22, but the company only announced the milestone yesterday. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YB6Nw4MKE2g The system uses a vacuum chamber within which a rotating arm brings a projectile up to very high speed without any drag penalty, before hurling it into the atmosphere “in less than a millisecond,” according to the company, as a port opens for a fraction of a second to release the projectile. A counterbalance spins in the opposite direction to prevent the system from becoming unbalanced. The vacuum seal stays in place until the projectile breaks through a membrane at the top of the launch tube. The moment the suborbital projectile used in the initial test is propelled out of the suborbital accelerator., SpinLaunch While the concept is fairly simple, the challenge of making it work reliably and repeatedly is a significant one. “It’s a radically different way to accelerate projectiles and launch vehicles to hypersonic speeds using a ground-based system,” SpinLaunch CEO Jonathan Yaney told CNBC . Yaney established SpinLaunch in 2014, but the company has maintained a low profile until now, and the CEO has said that this plays to its strengths and its “audacious and crazy” space launch project. The suborbital accelerator used in the first SpinLaunch test is a one-third scale version of the planned final hardware but is still 300 feet tall, Yaney explains. The suborbital projectile used in the initial test was around 10 feet long and was accelerated to “many thousands of miles an hour,” using approximately 20 percent of the accelerator’s power capacity. SpinLaunch says it ran the suborbital accelerator test in October as a way of validating the basic concept in terms of aerodynamics and release mechanisms. Since this was just the first test for the concept, the projectile was propelled to a height of “tens of thousands of feet.” A general view of the suborbital accelerator., SpinLaunch The projectile was reportedly recovered after its flight, with reusable vehicles being a key part of the SpinLaunch concept. However, it’s not immediately clear how the projectile will be recovered, especially since video concepts of the launch sequence show it splitting into at least two parts. Adding a recovery system would add bulk and complexity but might also reflect the value of each projectile, which is presumably crafted from exotic materials to withstand extreme speeds and friction heating. Digital concept art showing the rear of the projectile used in the future orbital launch vehicle., SpinLaunch The company has future plans to add a rocket motor inside the projectile to provide for orbital flights. In that version, the rocket booster will ignite only after it separates from the projectile/launch vehicle, as you can see in this video . According to previous reports , the projectile will coast, unpowered, for around a minute, before the rocket ignites at an altitude of approximately 200,000 feet. “Because kinetically launched satellites exit the atmosphere without a rocket, SpinLaunch enables a future in which constellations of satellites and space payloads can be launched with zero emissions in the most critical layers of the atmosphere,” the company says on its website. A graphic breakdown of the notional orbital launch vehicle with a two-stage rocket and payload inside., SpinLaunch The ignition of the first stage after separation., SpinLaunch And the company claims that these kinds of flights could start happening soon, with plans for around 30 suborbital test flights over the next six to eight months. Beyond that, the company is hopeful of moving into orbital launch. At the moment, SpinLaunch says it has completed around 90 percent of risk-reduction studies relating to the full-scale system, as it works toward finalizing its design. The idea behind SpinLaunch may indeed be “audacious and crazy,” but, if it can be fully matured, the technology would appear to offer major advantages over traditional space launch systems. Today, a rocket delivering a payload into orbit will consist primarily of fuel, by mass, reducing the size of the payload that can be carried. SpinLaunch, in contrast, envisages a much smaller rocket that carried a reduced fuel load, but a proportionally larger payload. The company currently forecasts its orbital vehicle delivering a payload of around 400 pounds into orbit. An aerial view of the launch tube part of the suborbital accelerator, the top of which stands 300 feet high., SpinLaunch Once the orbital vehicle is ready, SpinLaunch says it will have to move away from Spaceport America and seek a coastal space launch facility that will be able to support “dozens of launches per day,” according to Yaney. The rapid tempo of launches without the use of large complex rockets, will, in turn, bring down the costs of putting cargoes into orbit. The company claims that the velocity boost imparted by the accelerator drive results in a four-times reduction in the fuel required to reach orbit and a ten-times reduction in cost. The same kinds of drivers — speed and simplicity for getting small payloads into orbit, with a much-reduced fuel requirement — are also involved in the Green Launch initiative, which takes a different approach, using ground-based “impulse launchers” to replace a traditional rocket’s first stage. In the summer, Green Launch conducted trials at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, using some of the equipment left behind by the 1960s-era High Altitude Research Project ( HARP ). The SpinLaunch venture has so far raised $110 million from a variety of investors and is aimed squarely at the commercial marketplace, but the fully mature technology could well have military applications, too. There is already Pentagon interest in the company, with a contract having been signed with the Defense Innovation Unit in 2019. SpinLaunch plans to move its operations from New Mexico to a new coastal facility once it begins regular launches of orbital vehicles., SpinLaunch The limited throw-weight of the system, even in its type of orbital vehicle form, means that SpinLaunch will not be able to deliver larger payloads into orbit. After all, many traditional space launch rockets have throw weights measured in tons, not pounds. Nevertheless, SpinLaunch is likely to still meet many of the requirements of the U.S. Air Force, as well as the Space Force and the Missile Defense Agency, which increasingly need to put smaller satellites into space. What’s more, the promise of being able to rapidly put satellites into space could have a particular appeal to the military, which is increasingly facing the reality that its larger satellites would be vulnerable to an expanding array of threats , kinetic and otherwise, during a peer-state conflict. It’s conceivable the SpinLaunch concept could be an ideal way of firing smaller, less complex satellites into orbit at short notice, should the existing constellation of satellites be put out of action or otherwise compromised. And constellations made up of throngs of satellites that create a mesh network covering the planet will become just as big of a priority for the DoD in the coming years as traditional, far larger, and less numerous satellites. The same is true for commercial space applications. This concept seems ideally suited to support such endeavors. A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency infographic showing the various ways one satellite might disable or destroy another beyond a simple kinetic attack., DIA We also have to note that this concept, even in its smaller form, clearly could have other military applications. Ultra long-range artillery and strike capabilities, especially ones that can hit targets in short time frames from far away, are among the U.S. military’s top priorities. It doesn’t take much imagination to see how this type of apparatus could potentially provide such a solution, slinging a warhead over long distances within the atmosphere. That’s not to say that SpinLaunch would have anything to do with such a concept, but it seems blatantly attractive in terms of weaponized applications. While there’s clearly a growing appetite within the Department of Defense to investigate the potential of novel ways of putting military cargoes into orbit, SpinLaunch isn’t the only start-up involved. A little less than a year ago, for example, Aevum held an online rollout for its Ravn X Autonomous Launch Vehicle . This is planned as a reusable drone that will carry an underslung rocket that will, in turn, launch a small payload, such as a satellite, into low orbit. Both the SpinLaunch and Aevum concepts claim to offer solutions that are, broadly speaking, simpler, cheaper, and more flexible than traditional rockets fired from launch pads. Clearly, the companies must also be confident that their proposals would undercut the cost of air-launch methods, including the Northrop Grumman Stargazer or Virgin Orbit LauncherOne , both of which use adapted airliners to launch rockets that in turn put small satellites into orbit. The Pentagon already uses the Stargazer to launch experimental or secret payloads . Of course, SpinLaunch involves fixed infrastructure, like a traditional launchpad, so lacks the inherent mobility and flexibility of air-launch alternatives. SpinLaunch says it expects to conduct its first customer launches in late 2024. Appearing almost out of nowhere, with a concept akin to something out of science fiction, it’s tempting to doubt the viability of SpinLaunch, but the company has clearly pursued an innovative concept for rapidly putting smaller satellites into space at low cost. Whether or not we will soon see an age where massive disc-like structures dot the coast and act as a primary means of space access remains up in the air.

Undersea sensors off the coast of northern Norway that are able to collect data about passing submarines, among other things, have been knocked out, the country’s state-operated Institute of Marine Research, or IMR, has revealed. The cause of the damage is unknown, but the cables linking the sensor nodes to control stations ashore are said to have been cut and then disappeared. This has raised suspicions about deliberate sabotage, possibly carried out by the Russian government, which definitely has the means to do so . The IMR, one of the biggest marine research institutes in Europe, described “extensive damage” to the outer areas of the Lofoten-Vesterålen (LoVe) Ocean Observatory, putting the system offline. LoVe, which was only declared fully operational in August 2020, consists of a network of underwater cables and sensors located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, an area of strategic interest for both Norway and Russia. Cables associated with the LoVe ocean observatory are prepared for deployment in May 2020., LoVe Ocean Observatory Norway’s military and the country’s national Police Security Service are reportedly investigating what happened to the research surveillance system. LoVe’s stated purpose is to use its sensors to monitor the effects of climate change, methane emissions, and fish stocks, providing scientists with a live feed of imagery, sound, and other data. A map of the LoVe cable transect and scientific nodes (left) and its position off the coast of Norway (insert), and a schematic layout of the sensors in the LoVe network (right)., LoVe Ocean Observatory Of course, the system also monitors submarine activity in the area, so will immediately be of interest to the Russian Navy, in particular. Indeed, data gathered by its sensors is first sent to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment , also known by its Norwegian acronym FFI, before being handed over to the IMR for further study. “FFI is believed to routinely remove traces of any submarine activity in the area before turning over the observatory’s data to IMR so that it only contains fishing, currents, and climate information,” according to a report from Norway’s News in English website. “We don’t care so much about the submarines in the area (located not far from onshore military installations at Andøya, Evenes and other bases in Northern Norway), but we know the military is,” IMR director Sissel Rogne told the Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv . “You could see what’s going on down there regarding all types of U-boats [submarines] and all other countries’ U-boats. That’s why I didn’t think this was just a case for the police but a case for [the police security agency].” “Something or someone has torn out cables in outlying areas,” Geir Pedersen, the LoVe project leader, said in a press statement last Friday. Reports indicate that more than 2.5 miles of fiber optic and electrical cables were severed and then removed. In total, LoVe uses more than 40 miles of cables in the Norwegian Sea. Based on reports in the Dagens Næringsliv , the LoVe observatory has been affected by interference since at least April, when the connection between the sensor network and the control station at Hovden on the northern island of Langøya was lost. An unmanned submarine subsequently traced the cause of the breakdown to one of the underwater surveillance platforms, Node 2, which had been dragged away from its normal location with its connecting cable severed and removed. A platform within the LoVe network undergoes routine maintenance in 2019., LoVe Ocean Observatory A follow-up mission in September attempted to trace the cable running from Node 2 with Node 3, only to find that this platform also had been moved, its components damaged, and its cable was missing. The IMR research vessel G.O. Sars has been used to examine the area of the breach in the undersea surveillance network, including hunting for the lost section of cable., Sveter/Wikimedia Commons Meanwhile, News in English reports that the surveillance system has not been online since the initial disturbances to its operations in April. Rogne told Dagens Næringsliv that the size and weight of the cable running between Nodes 2 and 3 was so great it would have required something with considerable power to have severed it. IMR’s Øystein Brun told the same newspaper that the institute was now assessing whether the cables were cut deliberately, but suggested that seems the most likely explanation since the crew of a vessel should have noticed if they had accidentally become entangled with them and would likely have reported it. It’s also unclear what has happened to the missing cable, around 9.5 tons in all, which has not been recovered. Part of the investigation has sought to identify the vessels that were active in the area in question as of April this year. According to the IMR, that has been made more difficult by the fact that some of them likely were underway without transponders activated, meaning they would not have been broadcasting their positions to the Coast Guard or other agencies. Any vessel attempting to tamper with the cables would probably have had its transponder off, implying that a foreign power performed this act deliberately. In the meantime, at least some of the vessels in the area at the time have been identified, although no more details have been disclosed. The reasons why a foreign nation may have attempted to sever the cables, and take them away, are several. First, as we have already seen, the surveillance system is an important means for Norway to track foreign submarine activity in the Norwegian Sea, potentially restricting certain operations in these waters. Second, this power may have wanted to explore the type of information that the LoVe system is capable of gathering, to give an idea of the sorts of capabilities available to Norway and, by extension, NATO. Third, as IMR director Rogne pointed out , the cables themselves may yield valuable technical information, for anyone wanting to install a similar system, for example. The video below contains a recording from one of LoVe’s hydrophones of a larger ship passing by, highlighting the kind of acoustic data that the system can collect. With the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet on Norway’s doorstep, it would not be unexpected to see suspicion fall upon some kind of Russian espionage or sabotage activity, although the IMR is so far being circumspect on this matter. While we don’t know what happened, there could also be a more banal explanation, perhaps an unintended tangling of the cables with some kind of vessel or as the result of deep-sea dredging during oil exploration. However, News in English reports that there has been “lots of Russian shipping activity in the area of late, often cropping up around Norwegian offshore infrastructure.” In this case, the activity referred to is legal, but the implication is that this is an area in which Russia has a particular interest, and in which its vessels, naval and civilian, operate routinely. While the area is very close to the Norwegian coast, it’s also adjacent to the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom Gap, or GIUK Gap, a major strategic bottleneck through which Russian submarines would need to break through undetected if they wish to move out into the wider Atlantic without being traced. A Cold War-era map of the GIUK Gap., CIA.GOV Norwegian authorities have publicly disclosed Russian interference with and otherwise aggressive actions toward other sensor and communications networks in the region in the past. In 2018, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) disclosed three separate instances where Russian aircraft had flown mock attack profiles against a secretive radar station in the northern part of the country. The year before, the NIS blamed Russian jamming for disruptions in cell phone and GPS service in the region, though it said this was a byproduct of an exercise and not a deliberate attack. Prior to these new developments involving the LoVe, various reports have suggested that Russia has been deploying boats at least close to undersea cables in the North Atlantic, part of a general uptick in its naval operations in those waters . Recent activity has included the presence of the survey ship Yantar off the Atlantic coast of Ireland in August. As well as carrying deep-sea submersibles and sonar systems, the Yantar has been repeatedly suspected of covert operations involving undersea cables. “We are now seeing Russian underwater activity in the vicinity of undersea cables that I don’t believe we have ever seen,” U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Andrew Lennon, then serving as NATO’s top submarine officer , told The Washington Post in December 2017. “Russia is clearly taking an interest in NATO and NATO nations’ undersea infrastructure.” Certainly, Russia possesses special mission submarines that could well be equipped to both cut and tap cables, or even remove them for further study, as seems to have been the case with the LoVe network. In particular, U.S. Northern Command has highlighted the potential threat posed by the Russian Navy’s nuclear-powered midget submarine Losharik , compounded by the fact that it’s judged especially difficult to detect and monitor. A slide from a U.S. Northern Command briefing in 2016 showing an artist’s conception of the Losharik special missions submarine., NORTHCOM In an earlier piece on the Losharik , The War Zone described its covert role and unique capabilities as follows: The Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research, Russia’s main naval intelligence entity, also known by the Russian acronym GUGI , operates Losharik and its primary missions are investigating, manipulating, and recovering objects on the seabed, such as hunting for items of intelligence value or tapping or cutting seabed cables. The small submarine is also designed to ride underneath a larger submarine mothership to get closer to the target area. GUGI has a number of motherships converted from ballistic missile and cruise missile submarines . Losharik has been laid up since suffering extensive damage in a fatal fire in 2019, but Russia has other similar special-mission boats available , as well as large mothership submarines capable of bringing them covertly to and from a mission area. The capabilities thought to be provided by the Losharik , and others like it in Russian service, have long been a worry for NATO officials. Their concerns include hostile submarines operating close to their coasts and undetected while carrying out missions including tapping cables, deploying sensors, or otherwise collecting intelligence. Even one Russian submarine could potentially wield power far greater than its size, representing a powerful asymmetric naval threat by cutting cable completely as an information warfare tactic. While we have no evidence that this is what happened off the coast of Norway, it’s would be expected that this scenario would at least be a line of inquiry. A reported picture of Losharik running on the surface., VIA TOP GEAR RUSSIA That the North Atlantic is an area of renewed interest for the Russian military is also no surprise, given the establishment of a new Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command in 2014, responsible for the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Scandinavian regions. It includes the Northern Fleet, assets of which are concentrated on the Kola Peninsula, as well as military garrisons, and airbases, including a growing number of forward-located airfields in the High North. The Russian Navy has been exploring establishing underwater sensor networks and other infrastructure , including nuclear reactors on the seafloor to provide power, in the region, as well. The United States has also stepped up its military presence in this wider region, with a particular tilt toward cooperation with Norway. In recent years, this has joint exercises in the air and on the ground and consideration has also been given to operating U.S. Navy submarines from a cavernous naval base built under a Norwegian mountain. U.S. Navy submarines have been a more visible presence in the region. This includes a rare publicized appearance by the first-in-class USS Seawolf surfaced in a fjord near Tromsø last year and an actual port visit there by the Virginia class attack submarine USS New Mexico in May of this year. USS Seawolf on the surface in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway on Aug. 21, 2020., U.S. Navy Seemingly, the LoVe case has proven very puzzling — and costly — for the IMR, although it’s not clear what kinds of evidence have been gathered by the Norwegian military or intelligence services. As it stands, however, for the time being, Norway has lost a very important source of surveillance for all manner of underwater activities. While the IMR will hope to bring at least a part of the system back online as soon as it can, the Norwegian Armed Forces will likely also be eager to have this source of underwater intelligence restored as soon as possible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 23, 2022",Decommissioned Navy Cruisers Could Be The Answer To Guam’s Missile Defense Needs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army’s experimental deployment of the Israeli-made Iron Dome system to Guam is now underway, with a key focus being on the ability of those defensive assets to protect against incoming cruise missiles, among other threats . At the same time, the U.S. military continues to tackle the vexing question of how it can establish a much broader, layered missile-defense shield around the highly strategic island, and do so quickly, effectively, and affordably. One novel piece of this puzzle may be to repurpose Ticonderoga class cruisers that the U.S. Navy wants to decommission. Right now, the deployed air- and missile-defense assets on Guam consist of an Army battery equipped with the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, designed to intercept certain kinds of ballistic missiles in the terminal stage of flight, as well as the aforementioned Iron Dome unit. The service has stressed this Iron Dome deployment is temporary and that there are no plans to live-fire any interceptors while the system is on the island. A THAAD launcher on Guam., U.S. Army Plans to build on Guam a fixed Aegis Ashore missile-defense site, similar if not identical to the one the U.S. Navy currently operates in Romania , emerged last year. This proposal was prompted in no small part by growing concerns about air and missile threats China could bring to bear on the island during a potential high-end conflict in the region. However, in March of this year, Navy Vice Adm. Jon Hill, head of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), said that this kind of above-ground facility might not be able to meet air- and missile-defense demands for the island. Instead, he raised the possibility of building some kind of distributed defense system that could include subterranean and mobile components, as you can read more about here . In October, MDA submitted a classified report to Congress on potential options for a future Guam Defense System. At the time of writing, publicly available details from this so-called “Architecture Study” remain scant, and no unclassified version has been released. “Any recommendations for additional studies, including a requirement for only mobile systems, disregard the immediacy and complexity of the threat and the absolute need to integrate fires across the region from a forward multidomain command and control node west of the international dateline,” now-retired Navy Adm. Philip Davidson, then head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), told members of Congress in March. Davidson was an outspoken advocate for installing an Aegis Ashore system on Guam by 2026 as part of broader plans to deter Chinese aggression in the Pacific. This is where the Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers might come into play. There are presently 21 of these ships in active service, but the Navy outlined plans in its most recent budget request for fiscal year 2022 to retire the seven oldest ones. Each cruiser has an Aegis combat system , along with a powerful AN/SPY-1A/B multifunction radar and 122 Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells capable of accommodating various missiles, including SM-2 and SM-6 surface-to-air missiles and SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptors . The SM-2s and SM-6s have secondary capabilities against surface targets. The Navy is also developing an enlarged derivative of the SM-6 that will work with the Mk 41 VLS, which MDA already plans to test as an anti-hypersonic weapon interceptor . The current standard Aegis Ashore site configuration uses similar components, having been designed to effectively port over the relevant capabilities from the Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyer into a land-based system. These subvariants of the Arleigh Burke design feature an Aegis combat system, an AN/SPY-1D radar, and 96 Mk 41 VLS cells. An MDA briefing slide showing the commonalities between the systems on a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke class destroyer and a land-based Aegis Ashore site., MDA So, in effect, just one decommissioned Ticonderoga class cruiser moored in place could provide similar coverage and capacity to a single Aegis Ashore site. Using more than one in this way might provide a cost-effective way to generate even more defensive capacity in the near term. In August, the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., put out a white paper from Brent Sadler, a Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology, laying out exactly how this might work. Sadler noted that three of the seven Ticonderogas the Navy wants to decommission in the coming years — USS Shiloh , Erie , and Port Royal — are equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system and would be optimal for this new role. Aegis BMD, combined with certain versions of the SM-3 interceptor and other systems, enables attempted intercepts of larger ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCMs), during the mid-course portion of their flights, when they are traveling outside of the Earth’s atmosphere. “The Navy’s rationale for retiring the three BMD-capable cruisers was the high cost of continuing to operate them at sea due to overdue maintenance ; especially their fuel tanks, which have been known to leak,” Sadler explained. “Guam offers several protected anchorages that a moored BMD-capable cruiser could move between without having to conduct prolonged navigation. This potentially obviates the need for the Navy to man or maintain these ships for independent at-sea operations — potentially escorted or towed between mooring sites. This would enable putting the ship’s propulsion system in a state of reduced operational readiness and reducing the crew.” Sadler further pointed out that even with limited mobility, such as a need to be towed from one location to another, that these cruisers with their skeleton crews could be repositioned elsewhere in the region as necessary. These vessels might also retain their ability to launch weapons at targets at sea and on land. A map included in the Heritage Foundation white paper showing the potential coverage provided by three moored Ticonderoga class cruisers in Guam, as well as the U.S. territory of Saipan and the independent archipelago nation of Palau. , Heritage Foundation In addition, while Guam with its strategic air and naval facilities is often at the center of discussions about U.S. military power projection in this part of the Pacific, threats to the island have already prompted work to expand infrastructure on the nearby island of Tinian . There have also been efforts to expand partnerships with the independent archipelago nation of Palau to support various defense and security initiatives . Decommissioned Ticonderogas could help protect these islands, as well. There are still cost questions and other potential hurdles to this plan. “Some of these cruisers have the SPY-1A radar, which is an analog system,” Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday said during a virtual talk in July that the Navy League hosted as part of a lead-in to its annual Sea Air Space conference. “Others are early SPY-1Bs.” The Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Chancellorsville in Guam in 2016., U.S. Navy “They’re approaching obsolescence, number one, and, number two, they have difficulty seeing the threat based on the speed and profiles of the threat missiles we see flying these days,” he continued. “The cost alone for cruiser modernization is running tens of millions of dollars above what we originally estimated, largely due to the unknowns related to hulls that are over three decades old.” The Navy is already paying to develop and field new air and missile defense-capable radars for various ships , as well as new versions of the Aegis combat system, as The War Zone explored in this feature earlier this year. Lockheed Martin, the company behind Aegis, has specifically proposed using a version of its AN/SPY-7(V)1 Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) as a replacement for the aging variants of the AN/SPY-1 on the Navy’s Ticonderogas . Moored Ticonderogas would not have the same requirements to operate independently. This raises the possibility that they might not need to rely on any onboard sensors at all to engage threats. Instead, they could be networked together with other assets at sea, on land, in the air, and in space. The Pentagon is already planning to set up an LRDR array in Hawaii and has proposed installing a Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-Horizon Radar in Palau to provide additional sensor coverage to spot air and missile threats. Another could be installed ashore on Guam. There has also been discussion of establishing a satellite-based radar constellation that could be focused on areas of the Pacific. Within this context, decommissioned Ticonderogas could potentially be configured as little more than arsenal barges, leveraging their existing VLS capacity as part of a larger, layered defensive posture. Freed from the need to necessarily be positioned in a way that would give onboard sensors the best view of potential avenues of attack, they could be repositioned irregularly. This, in turn, would complicate the ability of enemy forces to target them. “It’s not new science separating radars from weapons,” MDA’s Adm. Hill had said in March when he brought up the possibility of alternative defense options for Guam beyond a typical Aegis Ashore site. The idea of using “engage on remote” and “launch on remote” concepts for missile defense , wherein some or all of the tracking and targeting data is provided by sources other than the platform launching the actual interceptor, is well established. It may even be essential in many cases to use this kind of networked sensor architecture to ensure threats are spotted and tracked quickly enough for interceptors to be cued at all. The video below provides a good overview of how a distributed, networked missile defense architecture would be employed, in this case in the context of defeating future hypersonic threats. Onboard radars and much of the ship’s mission support equipment, along with its main engines and many of its other maintenance-heavy systems and combat accouterments could be removed or abandoned. Command and control, as well as primary sensor systems, would all exist remotely. This could make using these ships to support missile defense of the island and the surrounding region very attractive in terms of price and sustainment costs. Approval from Congress to use the Ticonderogas in this way might present another pitfall. Lawmakers have almost categorically opposed the retirement of any of these cruisers for any reason for years now, citing the capabilities they still offer and the lack of potential replacements on the horizon . The House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces did signal earlier this year that this opposition might finally be waning , though legislators in the House and Senate certainly remain skeptical of the Navy’s plans to fill capability gaps resulting from retiring these ships. The House Appropriations Committee had separately moved earlier this year to gut all funding in the fiscal year 2022 defense budget for any future Guam Defense System based, at least in part, on outstanding questions about exactly how the Pentagon expected to spend that money. This was why legislators had demanded the October MDA report. The Pentagon’s proposed budget for the next fiscal cycle had asked for approximately $118.3 million to begin development work on new air and missile defenses for Guam. Repurposing some of the Navy’s aging Ticonderoga class cruisers, which the service already wants to divest, into moored air- and missile-defense stations could certainly offer one path to dramatically expanding the defensive umbrella around Guam in the near term in a way that might appeal to all the stakeholders involved.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 1, 2017",Russia Deployed A Smokescreen Over Its Strategic Naval Base In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent satellite imagery of the Syrian port of Tartus appears to show efforts to create a large smokescreen to obscure Russia’s strategic naval base there . Russian forces have reportedly conducted similar activities at this facility on at least one occasion in the past. The imagery showing the port yesterday was provided by satellite imagery and space technology firm Maxar Technologies. It shows what seem to be very deliberate palls of white smoke rising from points along jetties, from breakwaters surrounding the harbor, from other locations immediately inland of the harbor, as well as from at least two vessels steaming at sea. Our attention to the images was brought by Christiaan Triebert , responsible for Visual Investigations at the New York Times . Smokescreens have been used to shield military movements for centuries, and although the immediate impression from the Tartus imagery does not suggest it was necessarily highly effective, it could still have been useful in preventing some sensors — or prying human eyes — getting a good look at what was happening there. Since the start of the Kremlin’s Syrian campaign in 2015, the port has received a steady stream of vessels bringing cargoes from Russia. In turn, satellites, as well as foreign manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft keep a close eye on Tartus from airspace over international waters in the eastern Mediterranean. In general, Tartus is a highly strategic base for Russia, being its only warm-water port in the Mediterranean and the only such naval facility situated anywhere outside of the country’s own borders. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new 49-year lease of the facility with dictator Bashar Al Assad’s regime in Syria. That deal includes provisions for additional 25-year-long extensions after that initial period. It’s unclear how much the Kremlin spends each year to operate and maintain the base, but a report in 2020 said the annual cost was around $41.5 million. Depending on the type of smoke used, it could have been effective in obscuring areas of the port from electro-optical cameras and some infrared optics, including imaging infrared seekers used on various precision-guided munitions , such as some missiles that are adept at attacking littoral targets. On the other hand, it would not have helped obscure movements at the port from imaging radars or some multi-spectral cameras , found on platforms like the unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawk and which are tailored to peer through smoke, fog, dust, and other obscurants. We know that Russia’s military has at least trained to use smokescreens to help camouflage naval bases in the past. In 2016, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection personnel conducted one such drill in Severomorsk, where the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet is headquartered. These NBC troops, known collectively by the Russian acronym RKhB, are responsible for smoke-laying activities, as well as the operation of the TOS-1 self-propelled thermobaric artillery rocket system, in addition to nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological defense and decontamination missions. Russian language media reports at the time said that exercise was meant to show, in part, the ability of smokescreens to protect the base against both enemy sensors and precision-guided weapons. Back in 2018 , there were also reports that the S-300 surface-to-air missile systems that arrived in Syria to bolster the Assad regime’s air defense capabilities were unloaded at Tartus under the cover of smokescreens. Pro-regime sources on social media also suggested that this was the case. Training to rapidly distribute smoke around a strategic naval base like Tartus makes good sense. Prior to or even during an attack on that facility, smoke could be used as described above, to confuse missile sensors and to limit surveillance of the installation for targeting and general intelligence needs. It is a very low-tech countermeasure against very high-tech and relevant threats. Whatever was happening yesterday at Tartus, it reinforces the fact that the port continues to be a vital hub for the Russian military presence in Syria, and for Moscow’s continued ambitions in the country and the wider eastern Mediterranean.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2021",Army Revives Cold War Nuclear Missile Unit To Deploy New Long-Range Weapons In Europe,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has officially reactivated the 56th Artillery Command in Germany. This unit was previously active in that country between 1963 and 1991, during which time it commanded battalions armed with Pershing and Pershing II nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. In its new guise, it will serve as a hub for artillery operations across Europe, including deployments of new ground-based hypersonic weapons and other longer-range missiles in the coming years. This reflects just how important the Army feels these new capabilities, and artillery in general , would be in any future major conflict in the region, especially against Russia. The Army officially stood up the 56th Artillery Command in Mainz-Kastel, Germany, today, but news that the unit would return to active duty had emerged in August . The command is assigned to U.S. Army Europe and Africa, which oversees all conventional Army operations on both of those continents. The crew of an M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) fires a 227mm rocket during training. This M270 is from a unit assigned to the 41st Field Artillery Brigade in Germany, which the 56th Artillery Command will now oversee., US Army The 56th is co-located in Mainz-Kastel with the Army’s second so-called Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF). The service’s MDTFs, the first of which was established at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State, are still-evolving units that are being used as testbeds to explore the introduction of new weapons and other capabilities. They are expected to have an operational role, especially in any future high-end conflict against a major opponent such as Russia or China. “The reactivation of the 56th Artillery Command will provide U.S. Army Europe and Africa with significant capabilities in multi-domain operations,” Army Maj. Gen. Stephen Maranian, the head of the newly revived unit, said in a statement on Nov. 3. “It will further enable the synchronization of joint and multinational fires and effects, and employment of future long-range surface to surface fires across the U.S. Army Europe and Africa area of responsibility.” Maranian’s mention of “future long-range surface to surface fires” is clearly a reference, at least in part, to two new missile systems the Army hopes to begin fielding in the next few years — Dark Eagle and Typhon. Dark Eagle is the still relatively new name for the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which it is developing as part of a joint program with the U.S. Navy . The service is already in the process of standing up the first battery that will be equipped with these missiles, each of which carries an unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , as part of the MDTF at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. One of the first launchers for the future Dark Eagle missile arrived at Joint Base Lewis-McChord earlier this year., US Army Typhon, which the Army has also referred to as its future Mid-Range Capability (MRC), is a multi-purpose system that includes launchers and fire control systems that will be able to employ various types of missiles. At present, the service plans to use Typhon to fire land-based derivatives of the Navy’s SM-6 missile , which has air- and missile-defense capabilities as well as the ability to strike surface targets, along with ground-launched versions of the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile. The Army is expected to use its version of the SM-6 as a surface-to-surface ballistic missile. A U.S. Army briefing slide providing an overview of the components of the future Typhon weapon system., US Army The Army is in the process of acquiring a new conventionally armed ballistic missile, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which could eventually have a range of over 310 miles. There has been talk in recent years about the service fielding other new longer-range ballistic missiles , as well. There is historical significance to reactivating the 56th Artillery Command, specifically, to oversee the future employment of these weapons in Europe. Dark Eagle, Typhon, and a future extended-range PrSM, would all have previously been banned under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which collapsed in 2019. The United States and the Soviet Union signed this agreement in 1987. The INF entered into force the following year, and both sides implemented the provisions even as the Soviet Union collapsed and a new Russia emerged in 1991. The treaty was directly responsible for the removal of the Pershing II missile from Army service, which was then a key factor in the decision to stand down the 56th just over three decades ago. U.S. Air Force units armed with the BGM-109G Gryphon , an earlier ground-launched Tomahawk variant, were also eliminated as a result of the INF. Pershing II missiles ready to fire., DOD The insignia of the 56th Artillery Command makes a clear reference to the Pershing missile., US Army Though the U.S. and Russian governments continue to talk about possible follow-ons to the INF, as well as other future arms control arrangements, the return of the 56th makes clear that the Army is preparing to deploy units armed with weapons like Dark Eagle and Typhon to Europe on some level in the coming years. Those deployments may ultimately be rotational or otherwise non-permanent due to the willingness, or lack thereof , of even America’s NATO allies to host these weapons. At the same time, while the Army’s revival of the 56th is clearly linked to its future missile capabilities, the unit will also have a broader and perhaps more important role simply as a hub for managing all its artillery units across Europe. This includes those that will be equipped with new longer-range howitzers and rocket artillery . In recent years, the service has already been steadily standing up new units in the region to go along with these new capabilities, as it has broadly refocused its attention, on preparing for a potential conflict with Russia. Army leaders have warned for years now that the Russian Army has clear advantages in artillery capabilities, as well as in raw numbers of self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers. Any future conflict in Europe would almost certainly see the relatively rapid deployment of additional artillery units to the region, which would then need higher-level commands to manage their operations. This is one of the 56th’s core jobs, along with acting as a focal point for coordinating Army artillery elements with units from other services, as well as NATO allies and other partners, who would likely be fighting alongside American troops in any potential high-end fight in the region. A briefing slide the U.S. Army released in 2018 showing the range of existing and planned artillery weapons compared to certain Russian artillery, as well as air defense systems., U.S. Army The MDTF at Mainz-Kastel is a key element in all of this, as well. This unit would likely be in direct charge of actually employing new weapons and other systems, such as Dark Eagle and Typhon, as well as advanced networking capabilities that will improve the effectiveness and flexibility of artillery and other Army units in general. In a prime example of the kinds of experimentation these task forces are engaged in, the European MDTF brought high-altitude balloons carrying sensors and communication nodes to an exercise in Norway this past September. The Army’s 41st Field Artillery Brigade, a rocket artillery unit that was stood up in Germany in 2018 , participated in that drill and used the balloons to help find and engage targets at extended ranges.

Gen. Eric Wesley, who was then serving as the deputy commander of Army Futures Command and head of its Futures and Concepts Center, told reporters last year . “Those echelons we have mortgaged a bit in the last 20 or 30 years because our BCTs [Brigade Combat Teams] were so powerful relative to our opponent.” The return of the 56th Artillery Command to Germany after more than 30 years underscores just how vital the Army sees artillery, including new weapons, such as Dark Eagle and Typhon, being in a future major conflict in the region, potentially one involving Russia.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 1, 2022",Poland Sold Shoulder-Fired Anti-Aircraft Missiles With Coded Locks To Prevent Unauthorized Use,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Polish state-owned defense contractor Mesko offers, or at least offered, a system designed to prevent unauthorized use of its Grom shoulder-fired heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, according to a recently released report. This would appear to be the first confirmed instance of an end-use control system being fitted to a weapon of this kind, also known as man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS , despite public discussion about the potential to do so for decades now. There have long been fears about what terrorists and criminals might do if they could get ahold of these weapons. This piece of information was tucked away in a footnote in a report that Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an independent group focused on investigating arms trafficking in conflicts around the world, released last week . The document is the product of a three-year-long investigation into the flow of weapons to Russian-backed groups in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region. The government in Kyiv has been fighting Kremlin-supported forces in this part of the country since 2014, a conflict that erupted after Moscow illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region that year. A Polish Grom shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile., Spike78 via Wikimedia A pair of Grom launch tubes and a grip stock for this weapon were among the items that CAR was able to document in Ukraine as part of its investigation. These items were reportedly recovered after a battle in the Donbass between 2014 and 2015. A complete Grom MANPADS, a design derived from the Soviet-era 9K38 Igla, consists of a launch tube attached to a reusable grip stock assembly. The launch tube contains the actual missile and a battery coolant unit must also be attached before the weapon can be fired. One of the two tubes recovered in Ukraine had the battle coolant unit, but no missile, while the other had a missile and no battery coolant unit. Pictures of the two Grom launch tubes and the grip stock recovered in Ukraine., Conflict Armament Research CAR was able to confirm with the Polish government that these particular tubes and the grip stock were part of an approved shipment of Grom MANPADS to Georgia in 2007. The Georgian government confirmed this and also told this independent group that there had been no approval to export any of these components to a third party. How exactly they made their way from Georgia to Ukraine is less clear, but the most logical pathway, as depicted in the map below, would be via the Russian military, which may have captured some Groms during the Russo-Georgia War in 2008 . The Ukrainian government has never acquired Groms for its own military or other security forces, so it would be impossible to source them locally. Conflict Armament Research “The Polish authorities added that during the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008, many of the missiles, which had been shipped with the launchers, were used in battle and that at least 26 missiles remained in the possession of the Georgian army,” according to the CAR report. “However, some were abandoned on the battlefield and Russian forces may have appropriated them.” “In addition, the Government of the Republic of Poland confirmed that GROM MANPADS are equipped with individual starting codes to prevent their use by unauthorized users,” the aforementioned footnote adds. It’s not clear how exactly this system works beyond the need to input a specific code to get the weapon to function. There are no immediate details on the tubes or grip stock that CAR examined in Ukraine that would offer any clues. The fact that Ukrainian authorities recovered one launch tube in the Donbass in what appears to have been in an expended state, with no missile and the battery coolant unit fitted, would raise questions about how easy it might be to bypass these end-use controls. This is, of course, not the first time that such an end-use control system for MANPADS has at least been suggested. The U.S. government, among others, has had concerns about weapons of this type proliferating for decades now. Since these kinds of missiles are relatively easy to transport and use, the fear has long been that they could just as easily be employed to try to shoot down commercial airliners in a domestic context as warplanes on the battlefield. Starting in the 1980s, the Central Intelligence Agency supplied Stinger missiles to Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet Union. After that conflict ended, American authorities embarked on an expensive and complex effort to buy back any missiles that hadn’t been fired. As of 2005, American officials were still trying to recover some of these weapons. The U.S. government has sought to secure loose MANPADS in other conflicts to prevent their proliferation since then and this was one of the missions being run out of the CIA annex in Benghazi , Libya, at the time of the infamous terrorist attack on the nearby U.S. consulate in 2012. An actual physical system that prevents unauthorized use to begin with would be an attractive alternative. In 2019, Dutch researcher Jos Wetzels presented evidence , seen in the video below, that the CIA itself explored at least one such end-use control system that would prevent a MANPADS from being employed outside of a given area and/or time frame. Similar reports had emerged three years earlier about the potential use of “ geofencing ” via GPS to limit where MANPADS could be fired, as well as a hard lockout of some kind set to a timer. It remains unclear whether any of this technology was ever implemented. Matt Schroeder, a Senior Researcher at Small Arms Survey , another independent organization that investigates the supply and use of small arms and light weapons in international conflicts, who done extensive research into MANPADS and their proliferation wrote on Twitter last week that he was aware of another end-use system for MANPADS that functioned in a similar way to U.S. Permissive Action Links (PAL) on nuclear weapons. Again, it’s not clear if that specific technology has actually been put into use. These are not the only novel export controls that the U.S. government is rumored to have developed and implemented. There have long been reports that Pakistani F-16 fighter jets are fitted with systems that would allow American officials to remotely ground them , or at least disable some of their capabilities, should the need arise. Even before this confirmation that some kind of coded lock was added to the Groms sold to Georgia, there had been reports that Poland had been using this technology on other weapons. “There were reports that Polish manufacturers developed control technology for the Piorun,” Schroeder told The War Zone directly, referring to another more modern Polish MANPADS also known as the Grom-M. “However, the installation of control technology in the Groms exported to Georgia in 2007 is much earlier and, assuming these reports are true, means that Poland has more than a decade of experience with use control technology in exported MANPADS. Hopefully, the lessons learned through Poland’s experience will facilitate the development and installation of use control technologies by MANPADS manufacturers in other countries.” The Polish implementation of an end-use control system on Grom as early as 2007 certainly raises the possibility that other companies or thirty parties, such as the CIA, have put similar technology into use already. The confirmation that an end-use control system is or at least was available for Grom in 2007 certainly lends additional weight to reports that a similar system was developed for Piorun, which is seen in Polish use in the video below. This wouldn’t just apply to MANPADS, either. There has been similar discussion over the years about implementing these kinds of controls on other kinds of weapons, especially other man-portable missiles, including anti-tank guided missiles. There have been particular proliferation concerns about what might happen to TOW anti-tank missiles supplied to Syrian rebels by the U.S. government. The CIA reportedly required groups in Syria to provide video evidence of actually having fired missiles before they could receive new ones as one end-use control mechanism. Still, putting the kind of technology that Mesko developed for use on Grom into MANPADS, more generally, is of particular importance, according to Schroeder. “The installation of use control technology on exported MANPADS is a critically important supplement to other control measures,” he told The War Zone. “Rigorous export controls and stockpile security measures are necessary but no control regime is perfect and the theft, loss, or diversion of even a single functional MANPADS could have dire implications of regional aviation security. Assuming it functions as intended (and cannot be spoofed or disabled), use control technology provides a last layer of defense against unauthorized end-use.” It will definitely be interesting to see whether more information about the installation of end-use control systems on MANPADS or other man-portable missiles emerges now that Polish authorities have publicly confirmed doing so on at least one occasion nearly 15 years ago.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 12, 2021",This Myth-Busting Walk-Around Of The Soviet MiG-23 Flogger Fighter Is A Must-Watch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Will “Psycho” Ward knows his way around Soviet-designed fighter jets better than most in the Western world. Now, we can also benefit from his knowledge about the swing-wing MiG-23ML Flogger in an excellent walk-around video of the fighter that explains its many unique features and characteristics in detail. With 60 different types in his logbook, including the Korean War-era MiG-15 and the supersonic MiG-21 , as well as the American-made F-104 Starfighter and A-26 Invader , Ward is a true aficionado of Cold War combat aircraft. In the roughly half-hour walk-around video of the MiG-23ML—courtesy of our friends over at the always awesome Airshowstuff.com —which includes running up the engine and demonstrating its variable-geometry wings, he imparts expertise down to the minutiae of the different pitot tubes and access doors. But what really comes across is his enormous enthusiasm for the Flogger, and for Soviet jets in general, along with all their ‘special’ quirks. This MiG-23ML was built in 1981 and served with Czechoslovakia and latterly the Czech Republic, before being retired in 1998., YouTube Screencap In the process of taking the viewer around the ex-Czechoslovakian Air Force MiG-23ML Flogger-G at Lakeland, Florida, Ward also busts a few myths about the jet, which has, it must be said, not the best reputation in the West. This is the product of a general misunderstanding of how Soviet-era jets were designed and expected to be used, but also the less-than-stellar combat performance of (mainly earlier models of) Flogger in combat in the Middle East , in particular. Then there are the hair-raising tales of the MiG-23s flown under conditions of great secrecy in the United States by the “Red Eagles” of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron, which you can read about here and here . The early MiG-23s operated by the Soviet Union and its allies were, it’s true to say, less than perfect. These were demanding jets, rushed into service with limited avionics, and they were not necessarily highly appreciated by their pilots and maintainers, whether in the hands of Soviet or export operators, or indeed the “Red Eagles,” who lost two of their own to fatal MiG-23 accidents. With all that in mind, it’s worth looking at some of the key points that Ward raises in his highly informative video presentation , the caption for which suggests that there are plans to return the Flogger to the air in the United States in the future. The Flogger-G is not your grandmother’s MiG-23 While the MiG-23 started out as a replacement for the classic MiG-21 Fishbed, the MiG-23ML that we see in the video, and the further improved MiG-23MLD that followed it, are “completely different” from the previous-generation MiG-23S, M, and MS that were “rough airplanes.” The very first Flogger fighters were introduced to service without their intended radar, or even medium-range air-to-air missiles, while the MiG-23ML was a much more modern proposition, with better handling and maneuverability thanks to a more powerful engine and lighter airframe. The avionics and weapons were updated, too. In the four years that the MiG-23ML has been in his charge, Ward says he has not come across any pilot or maintainer that didn’t “absolutely just love this airplane.” A MiG-23ML in service with the Czech Republic in 1994., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons The MiG-23ML that we see in Florida still has its J-band radar installed. Known to NATO as High Lark 2, this operates across 10,000 to 20,000 megahertz and has a range of 53 miles, Ward says. It was actually a very respectable piece of kit for its time, with a look-down shoot-down capability to detect, track, and engage low-flying targets, and electronic counter-countermeasures to defeat enemy jamming. In Ward’s words, it’s “outstanding.” The landing gear is a brutalist work of art The “incredibly rugged” landing gear on the Flogger is seriously tough, enough to operate from rough and even unimproved airfields and to handle the demands of operating with up to 6,700 pounds of ordnance hanging from the jet. Brakes on all three wheels allow “very short landings,” aided by a braking parachute in the tail, and the ingenious way the undercarriage deploys and retracts through a process of hydraulic rotation is something worth looking at in itself — as in the video below. There’s also a ventral fin that pops out once the gear is retracted to provide stability. The MiG-23 has a very nontraditional landing gear setup. The narrow fuselage combined with limited internal space in that section of the airframe, made that type of mechanism the best compromise in terms of fit and weight https://t.co/bsIDGvU2OK [gif: https://t.co/OxRJGdLLrc ] pic.twitter.com/EUHUMWREci — Massimo (@Rainmaker1973) December 22, 2019 No, the intake design wasn’t stolen from the F-4 Ward also takes on another Western fallacy about the MiG-23, which supposes that the designers at Mikoyan-Gurevich took the engine intake design from the F-4 Phantom II and used it on the Flogger. Not true, says Ward, who points out that, while the form and function are similar, the MiG-23 has a completely different intake with different dimensions. The cleverly engineered intake serves to manage the turbulent boundary layer airflow over the airframe, with a splitter plate and variable ramps in the intake ensuring the airflow is decelerated to subsonic speed before feeding the engine, preventing unstable supersonic air from slamming into the engine and maintaining efficiency. YouTube Screencap The Soviets stuck with turbojets, but for good reason As for the engine, this is an impressively titanium-clad R-35 turbojet, pumping out 28,600 pounds of thrust at full afterburner, propelling the Flogger-G to a top speed of Mach 2.35. The MiG-23 series went through a series of increasingly more powerful and reliable powerplants, from the early R-27 to the R-29, and finally the R-35. In contrast to Western fighters of the same period, which mainly relied upon more efficient turbofans, the Soviets chose to retain a turbojet. However, Ward judges it was “probably one of the best turbojets ever made,” and “magnificently reliable.” Advantages of the turbojet include not only its simplicity but, for its time, a faster throttle response, meaning the engine reacts more quickly when the pilot demands rapid thrust increases or decreases. Ward puts the R-35 in the same category as the American Pratt & Whitney J75 that powered the F-105 Thunderchief and F-106 Delta Dart but notes that the Soviet engine produces the same power while being 1,000 pounds lighter. Ward has had no issues with the engine, and he is also full of praise for the integral TS-21 turbostarter, a 70-horsepower compressor that allows the engine to be up and running in a time of five to 15 seconds . An engine run for the MiG-23ML., YouTube Screencap A swing-wing with a difference The MiG-23, as Ward explains, went through three different generations of wing design. The first of these had a simple straight leading edge with three flaps. Next came a cleaned-up version of the wing, with no flaps but a dogtooth on the leading edge for better handling at high angles of attack. Finally, by the time of the MiG-23ML, the third-generation wing combined four flaps and a dogtooth, part of an overall airframe design that was tailored to maneuver at up to 8.5g. A Soviet MiG-23MLA or MLD intercepted by a Western aircraft during the Cold War. The wings are swept fully forward and carry external fuel tanks., PUBLIC DOMAIN Western accounts often describe the MiG-23 wing as having three different sweepback settings: for takeoff, landing, or low-speed cruise; high-speed cruise; and for combat. In fact, as Ward explains, the pilot can select from an unlimited amount of wing sweep settings and the aircraft is “very tolerant” when it comes to moving the wing around. The process of moving from minimum to maximum sweep takes 18 seconds and, once the wings are swept back, the stabilators (all-moving tailplanes) deflect to manage roll requirements. The wings, although clearly slender, also contain a total of six wing fuel tanks, which in turn feed three tanks in the fuselage. All in all, Ward makes a very good case for the MiG-23ML being a “beautiful artwork” of a Cold War fighter. Certainly, it is far from the crude and brutal stereotypes often found in Western publications.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. They have one of the most challenging and rewarding jobs in any military. Airborne combat search and rescue (CSAR) and casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) personnel are field medics who are armed and able to get into very hot combat zones to extract their injured comrades. But snatching-up wounded personnel under fire is often just the beginning of their battle. Stabilizing patients in rocking and vibrating helicopters — which can be extremely hot or cold inside — that are trying to safely make it to a field hospital is about as challenging a medical environment as any. Once they have arrived, getting their patients transferred as fast as possible to waiting medical teams is absolutely crucial. Every second counts, but information conveyance is absolutely key to the patient’s chances of survival, too. Executing this with extreme clarity and under incredible stress is an essential talent, especially when airborne communications are limited or non-existent. Case in point the video below of emergency room doctor, flight surgeon, and Canadian Medical Emergency Response Team (CMERT) member Trevor Jain executing a patient transfer with incredible precision and focus: Multi casualty handover for #CMERt . @TrevorJain showing us how it’s done: less than a minute, pointy-talky, ID all injuries, all critical interventions, documentation. pic.twitter.com/3G6583F6zT — Andrew (@Heli_doc) November 8, 2021 When it comes to modern battlefield rescue operations, it’s become all about “the golden hour.” Getting the patient to a medical installation capable of surgery within an hour dramatically increases their chances of survival. This lesson has been learned the hard way, over two decades of perpetual warfare, primarily in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in other locales, as well . Beyond CASEVAC, the CSAR mission is especially speed-dependent . With the recovery of a downed pilot or wounded soldier in a hostile area, for instance, every minute you can get to them sooner , the better their chances of not falling into the enemy’s hands, or worse. The hardware is also a key part of the effectiveness of modern military CASEVAC and CSAR operations. In Afghanistan, it become clear that the CH-47 Chinook was a highly desirable platform for this kind of work in the country’s hot and often high-altitude environment. Over time, this and many other lessons learned from these operations informed new ideas both on how these missions are flown and in terms of what aircraft should fly them, as well as what crew and onboard capabilities were optimal. An RCAF Chinook taking part in medical evacuation operations in Mali., RCAF For Canada, even deep into the Global War On Terror, it became clear that its own aeromedical combat rescue capabilities had languished and they found themselves dependent on allies for it. This, along with the reacquisition of the CH-47 Chinook (designated CH-147 in Canada) and so much real-world knowledge to capitalize on from its allies’, as well as civilian operations, led to the creation of a new aeromedical evacuation capability known as the Canadian Emergency Medical Response Team, or CMERT. This concept sees the Chinook being used as something akin to a flying critical care center, with doctors, nurses, and medical technicians on hand, as well as troops to help with force protection, which can extract patients from challenging and hostile areas and get them to a surgery-capable facility quickly and reliably. Lieutenant Colonel Leilani Doyle gives an amazingly frank talk about how CMERT actually came to be and its unique attributes: As Colonel Doyle mentions, the concept was put to the test in Mali . Here is a bit of first-hand experience from CMERT operations there: Now, as Canada continues to codify its CMERT concept, we are getting excellent videos like the one of Trevor Jain in action at the top of this article, as well as him giving a tour of the Canadian Chinook when it is transformed into a flying trauma bay for CMERT operations: Looking forward to seeing PEI soon…..check out CMERT capability.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",Afghan Pilots That Fled To Tajikistan Are Finally About To Leave With U.S. Help,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Around 150 pilots and other personnel from the now-defunct Afghan Air Force are reportedly in the process of being relocated from Tajikistan to a third country with the help of the U.S. government. These individuals, including one woman who is very far along in her pregnancy, had fled Afghanistan in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters as the Taliban swept to power in August . The fate of the aircraft that they brought with them, as well as others that belonged to the Afghan Air Force that are now in limbo elsewhere , remains uncertain. Reuters first reported earlier today that this group of Afghans had been set to depart from the airport in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe on a flight that the U.S. government had brokered, but that this had been delayed. It’s not clear if they have now left the country and, if so, where they are headed. Another group of former Afghan Air Force personnel who had escaped with their aircraft to neighboring Uzbekistan flew to the United Arab Emirates on another U.S.-arranged charter back in September . There is at least a hope among the individuals who fled to both Uzbekistan and Taijistakan that they will eventually get to the United States for permanent resettlement. It’s unclear why the process of getting these individuals out of Tajikistan has been more complicated. The government in Dushanbe has been outspoken in its opposition to the Taliban since they returned to power earlier this year. “We will get with [the] State [Department] right away to see if we can move this forward,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had told members of Congress in September when asked about this issue. “I share your concerns.” Part of the issue for U.S. officials seeking to assist them has certainly been diplomatic hurdles due to the fact that the personnel are not American nationals. Authorities in Tajikistan had detained them upon their arrival, holding most of them at a remote sanatorium , and had reportedly taken away their identification documents, which would have been issued by an Afghan government that no longer exists. “We are like prisoners here. Not even like refugees, not even like immigrants,” the pregnant former Afghan Air Force pilot had reportedly told Reuters in October, speaking to the outlet via a cellphone that was smuggled into the sanatorium. “We have no legal documents or way to buy something for ourselves.” In addition to concerns about their treatment while in custody in Tajikistan, there have also been fears that they could be deported. Before the Taliban took over the country, it had been actively pursuing an assassination campaign targeting Afghan Air Force pilots. Many former members of the Afghan Air Force still in Afghanistan are now in hiding , fearing reprisals. “I stood shoulder to shoulder with my American allies for five years — but now they have forgotten us,” a former Afghan Air Force Captain told The New York Times , according to a piece published this past weekend . “Our life gets worse day by day,” another ex-Afghan Air Force officer told that newspaper. “We can’t stay in one place. We are always hiding — even our relatives don’t know where we are.” Beyond the ultimate fate of Afghan Air Force pilots and other personnel who fled to Tajikistan, as well as Uzbekistan, what will happen to their aircraft remains to be seen. “Before the ANDSF [Afghan National Defense and Security Forces] disintegrated, AAF [Afghan Air Force] pilots reportedly flew about 25% of the total available aircraft inventory to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to avoid Taliban capture,” according to the most recent quarterly report from the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR . The aircraft that managed to escape to those countries includes a mix of fixed-wing types and helicopters. A satellite image showing Termez Airport in Uzbekistan on Aug. 16, 2021, with various ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft visible., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION On the fixed-wing side of things, there are A-29 light attack aircraft , AC-208 armed light utility planes , Cessna 208 Caravan small transports, and Pilatus PC-12NG intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms. The helicopters include UH-60A+ Black Hawk utility types and Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip-type transports . It is unclear if any of the Afghan Air Force’s shorter-range Hughes 530F armed light scout helicopters were able to escape. “I would appreciate it if we could put that in writing to both of those countries that the equipment belongs to the U.S. — not to Afghanistan,” Rep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican, had told Secretary of Defense Austin at the September hearing . While virtually all the Afghan Air Force’s aircraft were bought by the U.S. government, it’s not clear if they are actually legally U.S. government property now. It is extremely likely that American officials will use all avenues available to them to block any transfers to the Taliban. Similar legal questions will apply to ex-Afghan Air Force aircraft that are presently in the United States or other countries. “In addition to the AAF fleet in Afghanistan, 37 used UH-60 helicopters purchased from the U.S. Army for the AAF in 2017–2018 but not yet refurbished and upgraded were held in strategic reserve in the United States,” according to SIGAR’s latest quarterly report. Two 530Fs were “delivered in August, but DOD was able to extract them from HKIA [Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul].” “In addition, at least six aircraft (three Mi-17s and UH-60s) were in a third country or the United States for maintenance,” the report added. “The Afghan media reported that 25 helicopters were out of country for repair.” The War Zone has reached out to the Pentagon about the current status of any of these aircraft, including who officially owns them, but has not yet received a response. At least the ordeal that Afghan Air Force personnel had faced after fleeing to Tajikistan now appears to be almost over, if those individuals have not already left that country.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2020","Aevum’s Space Launch Plane Is A-5 Vigilante Sized, Its Claims Are Even Bigger","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A little-known U.S. start-up, Aevum , held an online rollout event yesterday for its Ravn X Autonomous Launch Vehicle, including footage of a full-size mockup of the aircraft. Established in 2016, the Huntsville, Alabama-based firm is proposing a reusable drone that will carry an underslung rocket that will, in turn, launch a small payload, such as a satellite, into low orbit. The twin-engine Ravn X drone — described by the company as the first stage of the system — reportedly weighs 55,000 pounds, is 80 feet long, and has a wingspan of 60 feet — roughly the size of an A-5 Vigilante. The sleek drone, strongly reminiscent of the smaller Boeing Loyal Wingman in basic appearance, has seemingly been tailored for speed and will serve as the “mothership” for a two-stage rocket that is able to carry a payload of just over 1,000 pounds. As such, Aevum classifies the complete Ravn X system as a three-stage space launch vehicle. Intriguingly, the full-size mockup shown in the video wears the U.S. registration N567RX, which, although it’s registered in the CEO’s name, is not currently assigned to a particular aircraft and, at the time of writing, due to be removed from the registry on December 15, 2020. You can watch the rollout event in full in this video: The company claims that using an unmanned vehicle as the first stage of its launch system has the benefit of allowing the rocket motor to be ignited as little as 0.5 seconds to 1 second after release. Such a rapid separation from below the belly of the drone reduces energy bleed from the rocket, meaning that it loses as little momentum as possible after being released. The company contends that this kind of launch profile would be prohibitively dangerous using a manned first stage. In a traditional air launch, from a manned vehicle, the rocket has to fall away for a longer period before the rocket ignites, keeping the crew safe, but decreasing the kinetic potential of the rocket. According to reports , the rocket is intended to be released from the drone at an altitude between 33,000 and 66,000 feet. Each of its two stages will apparently generate 5,000 pounds of thrust. Company CEO, Jay Skylus, told the Ars Technica blog that the engines “have been hot-fire tested beyond their full-duration burns,” and have “gone through qualification and acceptance testing.” Although there have been similar proposals using a reusable spaceplane as the first stage, the concept of a reusable, unmanned, autonomous mothership that can take off and land like a normal aircraft is new, at least to the private sector. The Ravn X also promises to be generally simpler, cheaper, and more flexible than traditional rockets fired from fixed launch pads. The company is at pains to distinguish its concept from other air-launch methods, including the Northrop Grumman Stargazer or Virgin Orbit LauncherOne , since the Ravn X first-stage drone accelerates the rocket up through the atmosphere at high-speed until a quick release and ignition. Exactly just how big of a difference in end-game performance this method garners remains unclear. AEVUM/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The highly ambitious timeline for getting Ravn X into the air will start with “vehicle-level testing” to obtain the required airworthiness certification and launch licensing for operations, a process that should take 18 months, according to Skylus. From there, Aevum plans to secure airworthiness certification for the first-stage drone from the Federal Aviation Administration. Once these goals have been accomplished, the company says the Ravn X will commence orbital launch tests from Cecil Spaceport in Jacksonville, Florida, by late 2021. That is undoubtedly a very ambitious, if not almost bizarre, timetable for a system that, apparently, has not yet been built. While taxi tests have been promised, the mockup shown in the rollout video does not seem to be suitable for this kind of test work, lacking fundamental features, as keen observers were quick to point out: While Skylus has confidently predicted that the Ravn X should be ready for operations within the next 18 months, there also remain some major question marks about the feasibility of the project and the source of its funding so far, which is reported to have included five rounds of angel investment fundraising. Aevum CEO Jay Skylus explains the launch profile during the rollout event., AEVUM/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Although the certification needed to operate this type of launch vehicle is somewhat uncharted territory, Aevum believes that the drone-based design makes the most sense from the point of view of its future customers, as it will be able to make use of existing (manned) aircraft infrastructure and support equipment. The drone portion is powered by standard jet fuel fed to traditional jet engines. All this is considered necessary to dramatically reduce the lead time required for a launch to a matter of months, rather than years, Aevum contends. AEVUM/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP As for the likely customers for Ravn X, the initial mission will be on behalf of the U.S. Space Force, following the award of a $4.9-million contract last year . This is for the Agile Small Launch Operational Normalizer, or ASLON-45, and was originally awarded to Vector Launch. That company had to withdraw after financial troubles, leaving the door open to Aevum, which is now scheduled to complete the mission in late 2021. Present at the digital rollout was Lieutenant Colonel Ryan Rose, chief of the Space and Missile Systems Center’s Small Launch and Targets Division at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, confirming that there is genuine U.S. military interest in Ravn X. She noted the “bold innovation and responsiveness” that Aevum has demonstrated. However, it may be a stretch to describe the Air Force as a “mission partner” in the initiative, as some reports have suggested . The firm has a plan to eventually provide eight to 10 launches annually, at a cost of $5 million and $7 million for each mission. Other government money is coming from a U.S. Air Force Small Business Innovation Research contract worth $50,000 and another, classified Pentagon contract. In addition, the start-up is competing for launch contracts under the Orbital Services Program-4, which could be worth almost a billion dollars across a nine-year period. At least one press release, however, seems to suggest that it has already secured this $986 million that covers the 20 launches specified under Orbital Services Program-4. In fact, Aevum is just one of several companies that will likely compete for this work. While funding is already coming in from U.S. government contracts, Aevum has also received private funding, although how much has not been disclosed. The company website mentions one commercial customer, but withholds its identity as “confidential” and it does not reveal when that mission is scheduled to take place. Ultimately, Aevum hopes to have 85 percent of funding come from commercial clients, while the other 15 percent is from different defense and research agencies. AEVUM/YOUTUBE SCREENCAP With costs that the company admits are not as competitive as some space launch rivals, Aevum is hopeful that Ravn X will instead offer a faster and simpler route to putting payloads into orbit, thanks to its independence from traditional rocket launch infrastructure: “After making its delivery to low-Earth orbit, the UAS [unmanned aircraft system] simply returns to Earth, autonomously landing safely on a runway and parking itself in the hangar,” the company explains. ASLON-45 will be launched from Cecil Spaceport, but the company has indicated that missions could be launched from any suitable mile-long airstrip. Ultimately, Aevum believes that payloads could be launched “as fast as every 180 minutes, 24/7.” The limited throw weight that is a limitation of this type of launch vehicle concept means it will not be able to deliver larger payloads into orbit, but that is not necessarily a problem for the U.S. Air Force, and now the Space Force and the Missile Defense Agency, who all have requirements for putting smaller satellites into space . This concept could potentially be used for other work too, including testing of hypersonic weaponry and air-launched missiles of other varieties. One could even see the potential offensive applications for such a system. If this concept were to come to fruition, just being able to more rapidly and reliably access low-Earth orbit on demand would be very enticing for the Pentagon, as it sees its larger satellites as vulnerable during a peer-state conflict . As such, being able to rapidly replace them with constellations of smaller, less complex satellites is becoming an increasing priority , as is putting new capabilities in orbit as needed at short notice. Despite a relatively huge number of legitimate questions about the viability of the project, it seems that Aevum has come up with an intriguing space launch concept. Only time will tell if the company’s bold claims will be followed by the successes that have been promised.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 5, 2021",Watch This Hypersonic Test Aircraft Wow A Crowd With Its Afterburner,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hypersonic aviation startup Hermeus added flair to a ceremony to unveil its first prototype design, the Quarterhorse , when it started its engine and set it to full afterburner. The reusable unmanned aircraft remained static on the ground throughout the presentation, but the company hopes to achieve a first flight as soon as next year. Hermeus issued a press release about this event today. The company had announced in August that it secured some $60 million in funding from the U.S. Air Force and venture capital firms to support the Quarterhorse flight test program. At that time, it said it hoped to have the aircraft actually flying within 18 months. The Air Force has invested in Hermeus ostensibly as part of a broader effort to explore potential future hypersonic and supersonic executive transport aircraft concepts , but the various technologies at play could certainly have other applications . Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Lindsey, the Program Executive Officer for Presidential and Executive Airlift, which is managing the service’s contract with Hermeus, was among those who attended the unveiling ceremony last week. Hermeus “When an aerospace company typically unveils a new aircraft, it’s nothing more than Styrofoam and fiberglass,” Skyler Shuford, Hermeus’ COO, said at the event. “But at Hermeus, we drive to integrated products. And we really, really like to make fire.” “We designed, manufactured, and integrated the aircraft, from nothing but an outer shape, in four months,” he added. However, it’s not entirely clear if what the company unveiled last week is actually set to be a flying prototype itself. It has no rudder, and there are no other clearly apparent flight control surfaces. It also appears to lack any sort of landing gear. This is not the first time Hermeus conducted a ground test of the engine it is using inside Quarterhorse, which is a so-called turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) design. A TBCC arrangement combines a ramjet or scramjet with a more traditional jet turbine. The conventional turbine portion of Hermeus’ TBCC is a General Electric J85 turbojet , a popular engine used in various aircraft, including the Air Force’s T-38 Talon jet trainer. This J85 firing may be what we are actually seeing in the imagery from the unveiling event last week. Hermeus Hermeus’ TBCC engine prototype running during a previous test., Hermeus Ramjets and scramjets have difficulty working properly at low speeds, which often requires high-supersonic or hypersonic air vehicles to be launched using some sort of rocket booster and makes conventional runway landings more complicated. In principle, a TBCC configuration would allow an aircraft to take off from and land on a runway like any other using its regular turbojet, but use its ramjet or scramjet during the middle portion of a flight. This would greatly increase the flexibility of the design by allowing it to use existing airport infrastructure and offering a way around regulations on commercial flight operations at supersonic speeds and above, among other potential benefits. Hermeus says Quarterhorse will be able to achieve hypersonic speeds — typically considered anything above Mach 5. “At these speeds — over 3,000 miles per hour — flight times from New York to London will be 90 minutes rather than seven hours,” the company’s press release says. “Mach 5 aircraft have the potential to create an additional four trillion dollars of global economic growth per year, unlocking significant resources that can be utilized to solve the world’s great problems.” It will certainly be interesting to see how Quarterhorse actually performs when flight testing begins and it has a chance to go soaring at full power.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 4, 2021",Metallurgist Admits To Falsifying Navy Submarine Steel Strength Test Results For 36 Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An undisclosed number of U.S. Navy submarines have had to undergo additional repairs to ensure they remain seaworthy after a metallurgist spent decades faking the results of strength tests related to the boats’ hulls. The person responsible pleaded guilty yesterday to fraud in the case, which related to tests that examined how the submarines would fare in a collision, a very real threat that you can read more about here , or in certain “wartime scenarios.” Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that provided steel castings to Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding, which in turn used them for submarine hulls. A Virginia class submarine undergoes construction art Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding in 2012., Newport News Shipbuilding The fraudulent activity took place between 1985 and 2017, during which time dozens of nuclear-powered submarines were completed for the Navy. Thomas is said to have provided false results for at least 240 production batches of steel, which amounts to around half of the entire Navy output from the Tacoma foundry in that same period. The ongoing case at the U.S. District Court in Tacoma has not heard any evidence that any submarine hulls failed as a result of the shortcuts taken, but authorities have confirmed that the Navy has had to pay additional maintenance costs to address potential problems and ensure the affected boats can safely go to sea. It’s not clear which classes of submarines are involved but in the past , it was reported that the Virginia class fast attack submarines (SSN) were those affected. However, since the fraud dates back to 1985, long before the Virginias started to be built, it’s highly likely that other submarines were also affected. The two companies that received the deficient steel also produced Ohio class ballistic-missile submarines ( SSBNs ), some of which were later converted into cruise-missile submarines ( SSGNs ), as well as Los Angeles and Seawolf class SSNs in the period covered. Examples of all of these are in Navy commission today. The Los Angeles class submarine USS Olympia (SSN-717) returns to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in 2019, following a seven-month deployment. Since the Tacoma steel fraud issue dates back to 1985, it’s possible that earlier SSNs were affected too., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Amanda Gray “Ms. Thomas never intended to compromise the integrity of any material and is gratified that the government’s testing does not suggest that the structural integrity of any submarine was in fact compromised,” Thomas’ attorney said in a statement filed on her behalf in district court. The attorney added that Thomas was not motivated by greed and that “she regrets that she failed to follow her moral compass — admitting to false statements is hardly how she envisioned living out her retirement years.” Exactly what drove Thomas to falsify the results of the strength tests is still unclear, but according to the Justice Department, she thought it was “stupid” that the Navy demanded the tests be carried out at -100° Fahrenheit. As a result, the department contends, Thomas changed the results to false positives in some cases. The Virginia class submarine USS Mississippi (SSN-782) docks in Dry Dock #1 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, ahead of an extended dry-docking selected restricted availability., U.S. Navy/Justice Vannatta The alarming case was revealed in 2017, by which time the Tacoma foundry had been acquired by another firm. A lab employee then noted that test cards had been altered and reported this to the parent company, Bradken Inc. of Kansas City, described in court as the Navy’s leading supplier of cast high-yield steel for submarines. Thomas was removed from her job as a result, and the Navy was informed, but the service was initially told the discrepancies were not the result of fraud. According to prosecutors, this development slowed down the Navy’s investigation and adversely impacted the corrective measures that it introduced. Bradken paid out $10.9 million last year as part of a settlement , accepting responsibility for the offense and agreeing to take remedial measures. Thomas will be sentenced in February and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The Justice Department said it would recommend a prison term at the low end of whatever the court determines is the standard sentencing range in her case. Clearly, the strength and toughness of the steel used to fabricate submarines’ hulls are of paramount importance to their safe and effective operation. Moreover, since the loss of the USS Thresher (SSN-593) in 1963, the Navy has called upon especially stringent requirements to ensure its submarines are safe, under the SUBSAFE program. The USS Thresher , while underway in April 1961. The loss of this submarine prompted a thorough review of Navy safety standards., U.S. Navy What seems especially concerning in this instance is that it took the Navy such a long time to realize something was amiss, considering that Thomas began to tamper with test results as early as 1985. Last year, however, the Navy declared that it was confident that measures taken to address any possible hazard related to the falsification had been successful. “We have done the work to understand any potential risk, and believe we have mitigated any potential risk for our in-service submarines,” James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition said the Navy, told USNI News . “It did cost us some time to go do the exploration to make sure that we were comfortable with the safety of our sailors,” he added. Geurts also said the Navy had examined submarines under construction to determine if there were any legacy problems as a result of the Tacoma steel. “We have done a sweep of any material that was in the queue for new construction submarines, he told USNI News . “We’re confident in the material for any of the new construction submarines,” he said. Both Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding continue to use steel provided by the Tacoma foundry. Meanwhile, falsification in the production of submarine components is not an entirely new occurrence, as far as the Navy is concerned. In 2019, for instance, Huntington Ingalls Industries, the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, was accused of falsifying tests and certifications on stealth coatings for its Virginia class submarines. A federal court was told at the time that the alleged falsified records “put American lives at risk” and that the company acted “knowingly and/or recklessly.” Authorities were alerted to that incident by the actions of a whistleblower , a former Huntington Ingalls employee. Members of the Outrigger Canoe Club escort the Virginia class submarine USS Hawaii (SSN-776) as it arrives at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in June 2019. Note the various missing anechoic tiles on the hull, which is typical after the completion of a long deployment., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Daniel Hinton In that case, the alleged shortcuts taken by Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding facility in Virginia left the class of attack submarines “plagued” with problems, according to reports . These deficiencies relating to the stealth coatings had originally appeared as early as 2011, however — again meaning there were several years in which the apparent falsifications seem to have gone unnoticed. In a separate issue, back in 2018, it emerged that faulty welds had been found in some of the missile tube assemblies being manufactured for the future Columbia class SSBNs. While building these in advance was meant to save costs, the service ended up having to address costly and time-consuming fixes. The Naval Foundry and Propeller Center (NFPC) in Philadelphia, a detachment of Norfolk Naval Shipyard, makes the first casting for a Columbia class submarine in August 2020. At more than 200,000 pounds, the casting was the largest of its kind in American history., U.S. NAVY/Mass Communications Specialist First Class John Banfield With enormously expensive and high-profile programs for both new SSBNs and SSNs now underway, after this fiasco, the Navy will surely be keeping an especially close eye on the production quality of structural components needed to ensure these powerful submarines perform according to their exacting specifications.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2020",The Soviet Meteorit Mach-3 Cruise Missile Was A Colossal Cold War Oddity,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Long-range subsonic cruise missiles are now a familiar part of the strategic arsenals of multiple countries, whether launched from aircraft, surface warships, submarines, or from mobile ground launchers. But in the Soviet Union, in particular, there was a little-known battle for preeminence between cruise missiles like those and much more ambitious heavyweight supersonic missiles. By the early 1980s, Moscow was sponsoring two distinctly different approaches to cruise missiles, although the mighty Meteorit — planned as a Mach-3-capable twin-warhead weapon with a range of over 3,000 miles — was ultimately doomed to failure. The background to this impressive weapon was a decree from the Soviet government in December 1976 calling for the development of new strategic cruise missiles that would be suitable for adaptation in air-launched, sea-launched (surface warships and/or submarines), and land-based versions. The result would be a Soviet answer to the American AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) and the Tomahawk , which were fast emerging as a survivable and cost-effective means of delivering nuclear warheads over standoff distances, with great precision. An air-to-air view of a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile after being launched from the destroyer USS Merrill (DD-976) on the Pacific Missile Test Center Range in 1983., U.S. Department of Defense On Moscow’s order, three design teams began work and, of these, Raduga’s offering was closest to the AGM-86, comprising the small, subsonic Kh-55 cruise missile . This featured broadly the same aerodynamic configuration as the American missile, with a straight folding wing and folding tail surfaces. It was powered by a pop-out turbofan engine and had an inertial navigation system with terrain contour matching ( TERCOM ). The Novator design bureau came up with an analogous solution, with the 3M10 Granat missile. In fact, so similar were the Kh-55 and the 3M10 that, for many years, Western sources erroneously suggested they were different variants of the same basic weapon. A Raduga Kh-55 cruise missile preserved at the Ukrainian Air Force Museum in Vinnytsia., George Chernilevsky/Wikimedia Commons Then there was NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which came up with a very different — far more advanced — idea for a ‘universal’ cruise missile (one that would be employed by the air force, navy, and ground forces), with its 3M25 Meteorit. Unlike its rivals, this was a huge supersonic missile, conceptually and visually more akin to the high-speed cruise missile projects explored in the 1950s in the Soviet Union and the United States. These were typified by the ground-launched Burya, which you can read about in detail here, and the Navaho , both of which were abandoned in favor of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Some work continued, however, the conceptual study behind the Meteorit dating back to the late 1960s. The Meteorit was designed to have a range of around 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), flying most of its route at up to 24,000 meters (almost 80,000 feet) at a maximum speed of Mach 3, before performing a steep terminal dive onto its target. The missile was around 42 feet long — more than twice the length of a Kh-55 cruise missile — and had cropped delta wings that folded in three locations, plus canard foreplanes, a vertical tailfin, and twin horizontal tailplanes. An air intake below the fuselage fed the ramjet engine and turbojet sustainer, while the submarine-launched and ground-launched versions also featured two liquid-fuel rocket boosters for launching. Launch weight with the booster section was nearly 30,000 pounds, or around 14,000 pounds without. Guidance was a combination of an inertial system and TERCOM. Two images showing the wing-deployment sequence of the Meteorit missile., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Improvements in air defenses meant that special measures had to be taken to ensure the Meteorit would be able to get to the target unscathed, not reliant only on speed and altitude. The missile was equipped with a towed decoy, and there are also persistent but unsubstantiated reports that it also used some kind of ‘plasma stealth’ technologies , cruising in a pocket of ionized air to mask its radar signature. This could also relate to the so-called Marabou plasma stealth system , which different reports suggest may have been intended for use on the production Meteorit or otherwise used the missile as a testbed. A Russian-language cutaway artwork showing the Meteorit-M (top) together with its booster section, and the Meteorit-A (below)., via TWITTER Another unusual aspect of the missile was its payload. The Meteorit was planned to carry two 90-kiloton nuclear warheads that would be ejected to strike targets up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) apart, each powered by an individual rocket engine. While this was initially attractive, the dual warhead was banned under the 1978 Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) II treaty, removing this innovation. A Meteorit mock-up with its wings spread., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Befitting its ‘universal’ ethos, three separate versions of the Meteorit were envisaged: the air-launched Meteorit-A, submarine-launched Meteorit-M, and the ground-launched Meteorit-N. Interviewed by the state-published Rossiyskaya Gazeta in September 2020, former NPO Mashinostroyenia chief designer Herbert Yefremov recalled that the Soviet leadership had envisaged the Meteorit as a counter to the U.S. Tomahawk (and presumably ALCM) and noted that “one Meteorite was equal in efficiency to dozens of Tomahawks.” The former NPO Mashinostroyenia chief designer Herbert Yefremov., Russian Government As far as Western intelligence was concerned, the new missile first broke cover when it was identified at the missile test range at Barnaul, and it was therefore given the temporary designation of BL-10. The first launch from a ground test rig took place in May 1980, but the missile failed to properly leave its container. In all, the first four test launches were unsuccessful. Finally, in December of that same year, the missile managed to cover a distance of around 30 miles, woefully short of the design performance. Air-launched Meteorit-A The Meteorit-A was to be carried externally by a version of the venerable Bear strategic bomber, the Tu-95MA version being adapted from an early-series Tu-95MS missile carrier. The aircraft had underwing hardpoints for two missiles. Although models exist showing a four-missile arrangement, it’s not clear if this was ever a serious plan. With a pair of Meteorit-A missiles on underwing pylons, the internal weapons bay was able to accommodate six Kh-15P nuclear-tipped defense-suppression missiles, equivalent to the American AGM-69 SRAM. A model of a Tu-95 bomber carrying four Meteorit-A missiles, rather than the usual two., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The first air launch was in January 1984, but was unsuccessful, ending in the self-destruction of the missile after 61 seconds of flight. Another launch in May 1984 ended in a similar failure, and the Meteorit-A was canceled at the end of the same year. A test launch of a Meteorit-A from a Tu-95MA bomber. The missile wings are part-way deployed., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP To Western observers, the Meteorit-A was known as the AS-X-19 Koala, and it was, for a while, expected to arm the Tu-160 Blackjack supersonic bomber , since its existence was apparently confirmed to the then U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci at the same time that he was shown around one of these aircraft during a visit to the Soviet Union in 1988. Submarine-launched Meteorit-M The Project 667 Yankee class SSBN was chosen as the basis for an SSGN version that would carry the Meteorit-M, after plans to adapt an existing SSGN, the Project 949 Oscar class , were ruled out as being too complex, due to the missile’s prodigious length. Thought was also given to adapting a Project 675 boat as a testbed, before modifying Project 667A K-420 as the sole Project 667M Yankee Sidecar class, which was also intended to take the Meteorit into service. The Project 667M had its SLBM tubes removed, and 12 Meteorit-M launch canisters were added instead, these being angled at 45 degrees. In the process, the length of the boat was increased by around 66 feet and the width increased by around 10 feet. Work on modifying the submarine began in June 1980, and it was back in the water in October 1982, followed by sea trials that lasted until August 1983. Official state tests were then undertaken until November 1983, initially without the missiles fitted. Meanwhile, more than 30 missile launches took place from test stands at Kapustin Yar and in the Black Sea. An artist’s concept of a Soviet Yankee class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine after conversion into a test platform for the SS-NX-24 cruise missile, NATIONAL ARCHIVES The first submarine launch was in the Barents Sea in December 1983. But the program was fraught with difficulty, including due to the underwater launch sequence (previous generations of Soviet SSGNs had to surface to launch their missiles). Other problems also emerged related to the guidance system and self-defense equipment. Official joint tests of the Meteorit-M began only in 1988, initially using ground test rigs, and then with the Project 667A boat. Only around half of these launches were successful. With that, industry and the navy decided to abandon work on Meteorit-M at the end of 1989, and the Project 667A was returned to the fleet with torpedo-only armament. The Meteorit-M received the Western reporting name SS-NX-24 Scorpion. Had it been successful, Yefremov says that, by the beginning of the 1990s, the missile could have been installed on 10-12 Project 667A submarines. A graphic from the Soviet Military Power almanac published by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), showing the supposed SS-NX-24 and its ground-launched version compared to other cruise missiles., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Ground-launched Meteorit-N The most elusive version of NPO Mashinostroyeniya’s missile was the Meteorit-N version intended for launch from, presumably, a road-mobile transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). As far as can be ascertained, no imagery has ever been revealed of the proposed TEL and there is no confirmation that the ground-launched missile was ever tested. On the other hand, U.S. intelligence was certainly aware of the weapon, or plans for it, and the designation SSC-X-5 was assigned accordingly. The Meteorit-N, and the sub-launched Meteorit-M, both required this huge underslung booster section., via Twitter Perhaps surprisingly, considering the paucity of information, some Russian sources suggest that the development of the Meteorit-N was the most advanced of the three versions. “Almost the entire volume of tests required for adoption and series production was completed,” a TASS report notes. Legacy Ultimately, 37 Meteorit missiles were launched, but reportedly only one managed to reach the design range of 5,000 kilometers. The program was “a complete fiasco” in the words of Steven J.

Attempts have apparently even been made to resurrect the Meteorit, including a low-cost version reportedly offered in 1998. A decade later, at the MAKS 2007 airshow, a mockup of the Meteorit made a surprise public appearance. At the time, the TASS news agency reported that undisclosed developments in electronics finally made the missile viable. Since then, mock-ups and models have made repeat appearances at MAKS and at other arms exhibitions while others have gone on public display in museums and industrial sites. A desktop model of the Meteorit at MAKS in 2009., ALLOCER/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Industry officials in Russia have also periodically made reference to the program, shedding a little more light on it and the hopes that were pinned to it. Speaking to TASS in October 2020, former NPO Mashinostroyenia chief Yefremov noted that Russia’s current military-industrial complex compared less than favorably with that in Soviet times: “The unique Meteorite strategic cruise missile can hardly be put into production again,” he lamented. “The restoration of a very complex and expensive project even by the standards of Soviet times is impossible in modern conditions.” Certainly, the huge distance the missile was supposed to cover (when working properly) puts it firmly in a class of its own, even today. Workers prepare to unload a full-scale replica of a Meteorit before putting it on public display., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP A Meteorit-A on display at the Patriot Park theme park in Kubinka, outside of Moscow., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons While a production version of the Meteorit has so far remained unrealized, Russia has since returned to the concept of high-speed cruise missiles for more strategic missions, but now with hypersonic flight performance — generally regarded as anything over Mach 5. Russia is now widely considered one of the leading developers of weapons in this category, with the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile already in limited service. The Avangard , which mounts a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) atop a heavy ICBM employs a very different concept but is also now fielded. So, while the Meteorit may have proven a dead-end, the legacy of the high-performance strategic cruise missile remains alive and well in Russia today.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Prior to the order for the new VC-25B Air Force One jets, the 21 B-2 Spirits ever built were the most expensive flying machines mankind ever created. Their design also represented an absolute revolution in aerospace technology, albeit one that is now nearly four decades old . The B-21 Raider, which is being built by Northrop Grumman behind extreme security at the sprawling Plant 42 installation in Palmdale, Calif., will show us the next great leap in stealth bomber technology, but we are still at least months from seeing it. The B-21 is slated to enter service around the middle of this decade, a highly ambitious goal, but until then, its flying wing progenitor will soldier on. Author’s note: See the update at the bottom of this story that has new information on this specific airframe, which is actually a test article. Keeping the Spirit force flying is no easy task. The stealth jets are notoriously finicky and extremely expensive to operate— around $170,000 per hour , putting it at the top of the per hour flight cost rubric for the Air Force’s inventory. Parts obsolescence —remember it was built upon 1980s technology—and its tiny fleet size conspire against its readiness. Above all, its sensitive low-observable coatings and structures are maintenance intensive, although they are easier to maintain than they once were thanks to major strides in material science and automated application processes . Regardless, these jets need a lot of work and every so often — every nine years to be exact — they need a complete depot-level overhaul. That also happens at Plant 42. It’s here where the aircraft get disassembled and rebuilt, oftentimes better than they were before with new upgrades to show for its downtime. A robotic coating application system has helped reduce the time it takes to reset B-2s, among other benefits., Northrop Grumman With that all being said, Plant 42 is where we find one of the remaining 20 B-2s. One of these bombers was recently damaged during a landing incident , although it is very unlikely to be the airframe we see at the facility in Palmdale. This aircraft was spotted by a private pilot transitting the area. They sent us some photographs of one of the Spirits sitting out on the ramp in its deep maintenance slumber. As you can see in the shots, the jet has been at least partially stripped of its coatings and some of its radar attenuating parts as it awaits the next step in its overhaul process. It’s a fascinating study in seams, embedded antennas, and patina of an aircraft that is at least nearly 25 years old by now—the last B-2, the Spirit of Louisiana, was delivered in 1997. The complexity of parts that make up the B-2’s flowing lines is just remarkable. Many hundreds of feet of radar wave-attenuating tape seal up its many access panels and joints., Reader submission B-2s age just like any other aircraft and need a deep overhaul from the manufacturer every nine years. Their unique, almost experimental, design makes the process very time-consuming and challenging, although strides have been made to improve it., Reader submission These aircraft have seen a lot of work done to their composite structures over the years. In fact, one of them was totally rebuilt following a fire that burned critical areas of the jet badly. The B-2s are just so precious that they get repaired when no other bomber would be. One of the new B-21 Raider’s primary design objectives is for its radar absorbant sheathing to be much more sturdy and far less maintenance intensive than the B-2’s. Considering all that Northrop Grumman has learned from sustaining the B-2 over the decades and how far low-observable engineering and material sciences have come in that time, the B-21 will be more user-friendly and economical in this regard, but just how much so is still to be seen. The company certainly seems confident that the B-21 will be a revolution over the B-2 in this regard. These photos are a stark reminder of the age of the B-2 fleet — which isn’t apparent in most photos — as the bat-winged bomber looks positively alien to this very day when inhabiting its jigsaw-puzzle like , smooth stealthy skin. Above all else, the images highlight just how much work goes into keeping the majority of the 20 remaining B-2s ready for flying at any given time. It is simply amazing how much infrastructure and specialized capabilities exist for just 20 machines. But even so, the B-2 offers clear value for what it returns in capabilities. There is nothing on earth today in operation that can do what it does—including delivering gigantic Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) onto deeply-buried, highly fortified bunkers located deep in enemy territory. That is an amazing thing to ponder considering the type has been flying for 32 years . The B-21 has some very big shoes to fill. UPDATE: We have new information from Northrop Grumman on this unique airframe! It turns out, it is not a flying B-2 at all. Apparently it is a test article they use for all different kinds of developmental and sustainment work: B-2 Test Article 0998, a non-operational aircraft that has supported testing for the program for over three decades. In that time and still today, it plays an important role on the B-2 program, utilized to test new low-observable materials, and to refine maintenance and repair techniques and procedures. So there you have it! Another interesting facet to the B-2’s story. I would imagine this test article has done absolutely critical work to keep the B-2 as relevant and as survivable as possible as it has aged over the years.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 29, 2021",China’s Giant Moving Warship Target In The Desert Shows How Seriously It’s Taking The Naval Arms Race,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A mocked-up U.S. Navy aircraft carrier and other warships from its battle group, as well as at least one simulated vessel that can move on rails across the desert in northwest China, are among the latest tools to help the People’s Liberation Army refine its anti-ship capabilities. While we have seen static warship replicas used in this way before by the PLA, the giant moving target is a new development and reflects the seriousness with which Beijing views its anti-surface warfare capabilities, which notably include anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) launched from the land and by aircraft , as well a range of advanced cruise missiles . Hypersonic anti-ship missiles could even be on the horizon, as well. Satellite images revealing the new static and mobile targets were published yesterday by USNI News . You can and should check out all the imagery and complete analysis from H. I. Sutton and Sam LaGrone here . The images from satellite imagery company Maxar show the training targets on what appears to be a newly expanded range complex in the Taklamakan Desert in southwest Xinjiang province. This is an area that has been used in the past for Chinese ballistic missile tests, including ASBMs, although the purpose of these life-size warship models may well also encompass trials of PLA electronic warfare systems and kinetic weapons. Aside from an aircraft carrier mockup, which was reportedly installed in early 2019 before being dismantled and then reinstated in September of this year, the group of targets also includes at least two Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyers, which would typically escort a flattop as part of its battle group. However, the most intriguing feature is the new rail-based testing aid, which makes use of a 20-foot-wide rail system onto which a specialized surrogate warship can be mounted and then used as a moving target, presumably mimicking different adversary vessels and their equipment as required. The USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) steam in formation in the South China Sea in July 2020. The Nimitz and Ronald Reagan CSGs were conducting dual-carrier operations at the time., U.S. Navy/Petty Officer 3rd Class Jason Ta Satellite imagery from this month shows the carrier target some 12 miles south of the main storage site at the facility, while the railway appears to extend beyond this point by roughly the same distance again, suggesting a considerable construction effort. Compared to static targets, this approach clearly offers a much greater degree of realism, with the ability to practice engaging a simulated vessel while it’s underway. The same kind of mobile target appeared in model form at the Zhuhai Airshow in September this year, as part of a display of different target simulation systems. The images of the model provide a better look at some of the details of its features, including the various vertical antennas. The China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) developed the moving ship target, which was was described as “a land-based system for mimicking Blue Army electronic warfare threats.” It would seem likely this could work both ways — as a training aid to test counter-countermeasures for enemy ships on offensive operations, but also potentially to test Chinese countermeasures against incoming threats. A placard on the model of the CASIC mobile target at the Zhuhai Airshow in September., via Twitter Interestingly, we know the U.S. Navy rapidly deployed at least one electronic warfare system specifically due to threats emanating from China and that it has fielded other similar systems based on other regional threats , which seem to at least include various kinds of anti-ship cruise missiles. The latter threat is also particularly relevant when it comes to the PLA. Another system, deployed aboard carriers in the Pacific, is also likely a response to peer adversaries evolving anti-ship capabilities in the region. A close-up of the recently installed electronic warfare system on the USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG-54). It is also found on other Asia-based U.S. surface combatants., HUNINI/WIKICOMMONS Being able to replicate these enemy capabilities and test them against anti-ship weapons and sensors in the PLA’s inventory in a realistic manner, all while being far from prying electronic surveillance sensors, is a highly relevant capability to possess. It’s also possible that these targets are intended, initially at least, to examine target acquisition rather than end-to-end missile tests, which would end in their destruction. According to geospatial intelligence company AllSource Analysis, which originally identified the new site, there is so far no evidence of weapon impacts around the targets. Of course, that could change in the future. Other replica ship ‘sleds’ could be built to be destroyed, too. This would allow for end-to-end tests against a moving target, which would be highly valuable to the PLA. As for the static targets, these appear to be highly realistic, with a much-improved level of fidelity over previous ones . The level of accuracy is impressive, with the destroyers, for example, featuring not only the helipad and bridge superstructure but also individual funnels and vertical launch systems (VLS). On the other hand, the carrier target appears to be essentially flat, with various details including the island and aircraft elevators missing. Nevertheless, it’s more detailed compared to images we’ve seen in the past of a cruder Chinese aircraft-carrier-sized static target. The target seen below, installed in the Gobi Desert’s Shuangchengzi missile test range, has been noted surrounded by multiple craters from large missile impacts. An older aircraft carrier-sized static target in the Gobi desert surrounded by large missile craters., GOOGLE EARTH VIA THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS Older flat ship silhouette targets arrayed as part of a mock port facility in the Gobi., GOOGLE EARTH VIA THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS The appearance of these new types of targets is especially notable at this point, with China widely believed to be refining its burgeoning ASBM capabilities. So far, there have been several tests in which missiles have been launched against targets at sea, but Western analysts consider that these technologies are yet to be perfected. By continuing critical parts of the ASBM test program out in the desert, China’s efforts in this direction will be better hidden from foreign intelligence and would also increase the options for telemetry and other means of monitoring the accuracy of these weapons as part of a fully instrumented test range. Furthermore, tests at sea involve closing off extensive areas of water to maritime traffic, alerting observers to potential missile trials as well as giving an indication of the overall capabilities of these weapons. In the past, the U.S. military has kept a close eye on ASBM tests , among others. It’s also a fact that it can be hard to conduct full-range testing at sea. The United States has the benefit of expansive ranges at the other end of the Pacific, with no need for overflights of other national territories when launching missiles from California or Alaska, for example. The waters surrounding China are far busier by comparison. China’s growing ability to target aircraft carriers as well as other surface combatants with ASBMs is, of course, an area of particular concern for U.S. officials. In its annual report to Congress on the status of China’s military capabilities, the Pentagon attributes the conventionally armed DF-21D (also known by the Western designation CSS-5 Mod 5) ASBM variant with the ability to “conduct long-range precision strikes against ships, including aircraft carriers, out to the Western Pacific from mainland China.” The DF-21D system is understood to have a range of more than 930 miles, a maneuverable reentry vehicle (MaRV), and the ability to rapidly reload its launchers in the field. “The PLA has fielded DF-21D ASBMs specifically designed to hold adversary aircraft carriers at risk when located within 1,500 km of China’s coast,” the report explains. Chinese DF-21D (also known by the Western designation CSS-5 Mod 5) ASBM variants on parade., IMAGINECHINA VIA AP IMAGES Although not acknowledged by Beijing, the first confirmed live-fire test for the DF-21D in July 2019 involved six examples of the missile being fired into the South China Sea, north of the Spratly Islands. In addition, the longer-range DF-26 (CSS-18) intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) fielded in 2016 is also available in an ASBM variant and is thought able to strike targets at a distance of almost 2,500 miles. A line-up of Chinese DF-26 (CSS-18) intermediate-range ballistic missiles., CHINESE INTERNET “The multi-role DF-26 is designed to rapidly swap conventional and nuclear warheads and is capable of conducting precision land-attack and anti-ship strikes in the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea from mainland China,” the Pentagon report adds. A map showing the approximate ranges of various Chinese conventional strike weapons including the DF-21D, here referred to as the CSS-5 ASBM, and the DF-26., U.S. DoD In August 2020, single examples of the DF-21D and DF-26 reportedly struck a moving target vessel sailing near the Paracel Island chain, in the PLA’s first known demonstration of an actual long-range ASBM capability. Furthermore, the PLA also has short-range anti-ship ballistic missiles which they also need to test, designs, which you can read more about here . As well as these “carrier-killer” missiles delivered from road-mobile transport-erector-launchers (TELs), the PLA is also working on an air-launched ASBM program, with the so-called CH-AS-X-13 having been noted carried underneath the People’s Liberation Army Navy Air Force H-6N missile-carrier. Overall, whatever their delivery platform, ASBMs provide a powerful new variable in the maritime battlespace. Being able to maneuver dynamically during reentry and flying at hypersonic speeds and steep angles of descent, these types of missiles are immune to all but the highest-performance defensive weaponry , and even that is questionable. Providing the ASBMs work as advertised, in a time of crisis they could push U.S. carrier strike groups far enough from Chinese shores to make their strike fighters and cruise missiles useless. In this way, ASBMs are a cornerstone of China’s anti-access/area-denial maritime strategy. Elaborate targets mocked up as U.S. Navy warships are a stark reminder of the tensions between Beijing and Washington, including over the question of the status of Taiwan and Chinese claims over the South China Sea . Beyond that, the targets signal once again the fact that anti-carrier capabilities are a central component of the PLA’s doctrines, with considerable resources being plowed into ASBMs in particular. Without a doubt, Beijing is expending significant effort into fine-tuning the effectiveness and reliability of these and other naval warfare capabilities, which is bad news for the U.S. Navy and its allies.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 4, 2021",Watch The Goodyear Blimp Make A Crazy Zoom Climb Out Of Long Beach Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Maximum performance climbs are always a spectacle to behold. It can be an MD-80 Mad Dog or an F-15 Advanced Eagle , seeing a flying machine giving its all at low-level just prior to clawing its way into the heavens is the ultimate crowd-pleaser. But have you ever seen an airship pull off such a feat? Probably not. Thanks to Scott Lowe ( @tropicstation ), we get a glimpse of just that. The Goodyear Blimp (it’s really a semi-rigid airship or Zepplin now) is about as iconic of a flying machine as it gets. Pretty much everyone has encountered it at some point in their lives and it remains a staple of major sporting events, sometimes acting as a camera ship for incredible aerial photography of the exhibition and even of game-opener military flyovers . It’s also by far the average American’s closest connection to lighter than air flight. As such, it works as something of an ambassador for this unique realm of aviation and to times gone by when it had a greater presence in the skies. But seeing a Goodyear Blimp meander overhead is a far cry from seeing one execute a low/missied approach down a runway before entering into a stunning maximum-performance climb. Check it out for yourselves!: This awesome sight was captured by Scott Lowe, who keeps a close eye on aviation happenings in Southern California. Here’s what he told The War Zone about the awesome video: I was attending the Long Beach Festival of Flight at KLGB and spotted the Goodyear Blimp, based just a few miles away in Carson, approaching from the west. I sprinted towards the fence as the airship descended towards runway 26L and filmed it flying a low pass down the runway before it pulled into a dramatic max performance climb. In my years flying around Southern California, I’ve seen the Goodyear Blimp perform similar maneuvers at other local airports in the past so it must be something they do for practice in addition to looking extremely cool. The airship repeated the maneuver twice more throughout the day. I’ve filmed enough fast jets making low passes that I had to consciously remember to slow down my camera pan and be patient because it was moving so slowly! The Goodyear Blimps of today are far higher-performance flying machines compared to their predecessors that were in service less than a decade ago. Three of these modern semi-rigid airships have replaced Goodyear’s older fleet of non-rigid blimps over the last decade. They were designed and built by Goodyear and Germany’s ZLT Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, and are based in California, Ohio, and Florida. Goodyear’s young semi-rigid airship Wingfoot 2 over Los Angeles., Goodyear These new airships are significantly longer than the blimps they replace—192-feet-long versus 246-feet-long. They feature advanced avionics, flight controls, and propulsion systems. They can make vertical takeoffs and landings via their thrust vectoring capabilities and are faster than their most recent processors by over a third. Seeing as they are primarily a marketing tool, persistence is key—they can be airborne for up to a whopping 48 hours , although normal missions usually last a fraction of that time. They can hit speeds of 73 MPH and fly as high as 10,000 feet. Wired did a great two-part video series on these new airships that is really worth a watch: So, there you have it.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 30, 2021",Planetary Defense Test To See If An Asteroid’s Path Can Be Changed Is About To Launch,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. NASA is about to try to use a “kinetic impactor” to alter the motion of an asteroid in space in a test that sounds like it was ripped straight from a Hollywood blockbuster disaster flick. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using an interceptor of sorts to deflect future asteroids that might find themselves on collision courses with Earth. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft arrived at Vandenberg Space Force Base last month, NASA disclosed yesterday . It is now at SpaceX ‘s Payload Processing Facility on that base, where work will start to load it on top of a Falcon 9 rocket next week. The actual launch is scheduled to take place from Vandenberg’s Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) on Nov. 23, 2021. The original plan had been to start this mission in July , but the launch date was pushed back due to unspecified technical issues and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. DART’s target is Dimorphos, which does not pose a threat to the Earth and is around 525 feet in diameter. The closest it has been recorded coming to our planet was within a distance of just over 4.46 million miles in 2003, per a database that NASA maintains, and is expected to be around 6.8 million miles away when the spacecraft collides with it. This asteroid, which was only formally given a name last year as part of this mission, orbits around another, larger one named Didymos with a diameter just shy of 2,560 feet. The hope is that the DART spacecraft will demonstrate that is possible to alter the motion of an asteroid in a deliberate way by smashing another object into it in the vacuum of space. Even a small change in course initially as a result of the impact could be useful as the deviation could grow substantially over time, putting the threat outside of well outside of any potential impact window by the time it comes anywhere near Earth. The force also needs to be measured enough so as not to shatter the target, which could simply create multiple threatening objects. “DART will be the first demonstration of the ‘kinetic impactor’ technique in which a spacecraft deliberately collides with a known asteroid at high speed to change the asteroid’s motion in space,” Lindley Johnson, NASA’s Planetary Defense Officer, said in a statement. “This technique is thought to be the most technologically mature approach for mitigating a potentially hazardous asteroid, and it will help planetary defense experts refine asteroid kinetic impactor computer models, giving insight into how we could deflect potentially dangerous near-Earth objects in the future.” DART, which the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) designed and built for NASA over a period of more than a decade, only has one instrument, the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation, or DRACO . Combined with an antonymous navigation system, the spacecraft will use DRACO to identify Dimorphos and aim itself toward the asteroid. It does incorporate advanced technologies, including a xenon-powered NEXT-C ion propulsion system, which is intended to provide improved performance and fuel efficiency over previously propulsion options, and “a flat, slotted high-gain antenna for efficient communication between Earth and the spacecraft,” according to NASA. A graphic showing components of the DART spacecraft, including the DRACO instrument, the NEXT-C engine, the  Radial Line Slot Array (RLSA) antenna, and the ROSAs (Roll-Out Solar Arrays). The ROSAs are seen in their stowed position., NASA The actual DART spacecraft., NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Ed Whitman “I’m both amazed and grateful that DART has gone from a twinkle in the eye to a spacecraft in final preparation for launch within 11 years,” said Andy Cheng, the DART investigation team lead at APL and who is credited with coming up with the original idea for this spacecraft, said in a statement. “What made it possible was a great team that overcame all the challenges of building a spacecraft to do something never done before.” A small CubeSat provided by the Italian Space Agency, called the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, or LICIACub , will accompany DART on this mission. LICIACub will initially be attached directly to DART, but will be released five days before the impact in order to gather imagery of the test. The European Space Agency (ESA) already has plans to launch an additional probe, called Hera , years from now in order to better assess what effect the impact actually had on Dimorphous. DART is part of NASA’s broader Planetary Defense efforts , which also include various terrestrial and space-based sensors, including optical and radar telescopes on the ground, to spot and track asteroids that could pose potential threats to Earth. NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office has supported various related research projects , such as sending the OSIRIS-REx probe to the asteroid Bennu to collect samples and other data, as well. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the DART concept will show real promise as a result of this test. NASA is likely years away from getting its hands on a robust set of data from this mission. It will take a not-insignificant amount of time for the spacecraft just to get to Dimorphos in the first place. There is always the potential for issues to emerge during that transit, even before it attempts to actually collide with the asteroid. At the same time, the risk of an asteroid, or another type of object from space, hitting Earth is very real. In 2013, a meteorite more than 66 feet in diameter exploded in the atmosphere above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, sending out a massive shockwave that shattered windows. This was the largest known natural object to enter the Earth’s atmosphere since the Tunguska event , which took place in Russia’s Siberia region in 1908. That incident involved an exploding meteoroid estimated to have been between 160 and 200 feet in diameter, the blast from which flattened some 830 square miles of forest, destroying some 80 million trees in the process. Asteroids and other objects continue to pass by the Earth on a regular basis, with the vast majority being harmless. Just in October, a very small asteroid around 6.6 feet in diameter, came relatively close to our planet , but did not enter the atmosphere. More are apparently headed our way soon . However, while we arm ourselves for seemingly every conceivable terrestrial conflict, and now even a possible one in space , a truly devastating or even human-life ending event could be hurtling our way right now. History has shown this is only a matter of time . So, after more than a decade preparing DART for this mission, NASA is no doubt eager to send out this spacecraft to finally find out whether this disaster movie-esque idea of redirecting an asteroid through kinetic means and pushing it away from Earth is at all feasible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 11, 2021",C-130 Successfully Snatches Gremlins Drone In Midair,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency says a specially equipped C-130 Hercules cargo plane successfully recovered an X-61A Gremlins drone in mid-air last month. That round of testing also saw two X-61As flying together and showed that one of the drones could be refurbished and launched on a second mission within 24 hours of its first one. These are all key capabilities that the Gremlins program has been working to demonstrate , as you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s past reporting here . It is not entirely clear when or where exactly this rounding of testing took place, according to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) press release issued today. DARPA did say that two X-61As, also known a Gremlin Air Vehicles (GAV) were used in the tests and that they “successfully validated all autonomous formation flying positions and safety features before” one was recovered in flight. The GAVs are also capable of safely descending down to the ground after a flight using an internal parachute recovery system. “This recovery was the culmination of years of hard work and demonstrates the feasibility of safe, reliable airborne recovery,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Paul Calhoun, the Gremlins program manager within DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), said in a statement. “Such a capability will likely prove to be critical for future distributed air operations.” DARPA failed to demonstrate this aerial recovery capability in testing last year. Then-Gremlins program manager Scott Wierzbanowski said “we came within inches of connection on each attempt” at the time. “Airborne recovery is complex,” Calhoun added about this new round of testing. “We will take some time to enjoy the success of this deployment, then get back to work further analyzing the data and determining next steps for the Gremlins technology.” The Gremlins program has been ongoing since 2015. DARPA selected a team led by defense contractor Dynetics, now a subsidiary of Leidos, to actually build and demonstrate the GAVs in 2018. Drone maker Kratos developed both the X-61A drone itself and the aerial recovery system. This successful aerial recovery is an important milestone in the program, which has long been seen as an important stepping stone to exciting future unmanned capabilities for the U.S. military, including low-cost, networked drone swarms operating with a high degree of autonomy. DARPA has previously described swarming enemy air defenses as one notional mission set for operational drones derived from the X-61A and its mothership concept. By their nature, swarms present challenges for all kinds of defenders, being able to present threats across a relatively broad area and approach from multiple vectors at once, overwhelming opponents in the process. Individual drones inside a swarm can also be loaded with various different payloads, including various kinds of sensors, electronic warfare suites , directed energy weapons , or small warheads , to increase the flexibility of the entire group. Being able to recover and refurbish any drones that are not destroyed in a swarming attack offers operational benefits, including reducing the time it takes to launch another wave, and a way to help keep the costs to carry out these missions as low as possible . There are even discussions now about whether aircraft could recover drones from a swarm in flight after a mission and be able to get them ready to be launched again without having to land. Air launching drones from a mothership already provides a way to deliver simpler, cheaper designs closer to multiple intended target areas over great distances. Aerial launch and recovery of unmanned aircraft, including from other drones , is an area of rapidly growing interest for the U.S. military, in general. General Atomics’ Sparrowhawk , which is also designed to be recovered in mid-air , is a prime example of another Gremlins-like design now in development. With the recent successful recovery test, Gremlins has now demonstrated the general feasibility of this key concept, which opens up new and exciting possibilities going forward.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 10, 2021",Saudis Cleared To Buy Hundreds More AMRAAM Missiles They’ve Been Using To Shoot Down Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia plans on topping up its stocks of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs , with a batch of no fewer than 280 examples, worth $650 million, with which to arm its fighter jets. The planned missile spending spree comes as the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) continues its relentless campaign to shoot down drones launched against its territory by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen. The U.S. State Department yesterday approved the sale of the 280 AMRAAMs to Saudi Arabia, comprising a mixture of AIM-120C-7 and C-8 models, which are among the most modern versions of these weapons available for export. The missiles will be sold to Saudi Arabia via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process, providing the sale is approved by the U.S. Congress. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15C Eagles, the nearest jet at least carrying AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles on its fuselage stations, fly in formation with U.S. Air Force F-15Cs in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, in June 2019., Royal Saudi Air Force As well as the missiles themselves, the RSAF is set to receive 596 LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers (MRL), containers, support and support equipment, spare parts, plus other U.S. government and contractor support services. “The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by increasing its stocks of medium-range missiles for its fighter aircraft fleet for its national defense,” the FMS notice asserts. The same document notes that the missiles will be used to arm the RSAF’s Eurofighter Typhoon , F-15C/D, F-15S, and F-15SA fighter jets, which form the spearhead of its combat fleet. While the AMRAAM is the radar-guided missile of choice for most fighters of Western design, the fact that Saudi Arabia is now buying them in such a considerable quantity points to the fact the RSAF is expending these weapons in considerable numbers as it battles the Houthi drone threat. A U.S. Air Force F-15C launches an AIM-120 AMRAAM during Exercise Combat Archer, an air-to-air Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, U.S. Air Force/TSGT MICHAEL AMMONS The U.S. State Department effectively confirmed that the AMRAAM deal is related to the Houthi drone threat, stating on Twitter: “We’ve seen an increase in cross-border attacks against Saudi Arabia over the past year. Saudi AIM-120C missiles, deployed from Saudi aircraft, have been instrumental in intercepting these attacks that also U.S. forces at risk and over 70,000 U.S. citizens in the Kingdom at risk.” A subsequent tweet noted that the proposed sale would serve to “replenish Saudi Arabia’s existing [AMRAAM] inventory in keeping with the President’s commitment to support the territorial defense of Saudi Arabia.” These tweets seem to have been issued to distance the U.S. government from Saudi-led ‘offensive’ operations against the Houthis, with Washington having announced in February that it would cease to support these, at the same time delisting the Houthis as a designated terrorist group. However, the U.S. is still helping the Kingdom defend itself against Houthi attacks. Although relatively infrequently reported via official Saudi channels, the RSAF faces an almost daily challenge to detect, intercept, and destroy Houthi suicide drones, which are directed against Saudi targets, as are ballistic and cruise missiles . Normally flying at low levels, the drones are typically tackled by RSAF manned fighters, as well as Patriot surface-to-air missiles . Exactly how an RSAF F-15 deals with a low-flying Houthi drone is made abundantly clear in the following video, which emerged earlier this year, and which we discussed at the time: Either of these options is a very expensive way of countering what’s essentially a low-cost threat. Based on the latest FMS contract, it’s clear that acquiring AMRAAMs in significant numbers is a very expensive undertaking. While it’s not clear how much Saudi Arabia will pay per missile , the U.S. Air Force can expect to pay around $1 million for a single AIM-120C round and, on top of that, other costs such as aircraft acquisition, maintenance, and training all need to be factored in. The AMRAAM is not designed to shoot down small targets like the Qasef-1 , a long-range suicide drone derived from the Iranian Ababil-2, as well as the improved Qasef-2K, that are widely used by the Houthis. The Qasef drones appear to have first been used in Houthi attacks in 2016. Carrying up to 66 pounds of explosives, they are guided using commercially available satellite navigation. The remains of a Qasef-1 drone., CONFLICT ARMAMENT RESEARCH However, the limited thermal signature of these drones means an infrared-guided missile such as an AIM-9 Sidewinder is considered a less reliable means of scoring a kill compared to a radar-guided weapon like the AIM-120. Speaking to The War Zone , a former U.S. Air Force F-15 pilot who preferred to remain anonymous explained that while an AMRAAM is not the only option in this type of engagement “it may be best, depending on the target size and engine type.” Another former USAF Eagle driver, also speaking on condition of anonymity, added: “By not putting out enough of an infrared signature, you might not get a tone before going inside the minimum range, rendering the AIM-9 useless. Apparently, the drones have enough of a radar signature to enable a target lock before hitting the AMRAAM’s minimum range, which would explain the Saudi pilots’ choice of missile.” An F-15SA passes through Star Wars Canyon, California, on a test sortie in June 2018. The jet displays the current maximum air-to-air loadout of 12 AIM-120 AMRAAMs., CHRISTOPHER MCGREEVY Another alternative would be to use the onboard cannon that arms each Typhoon and F-15, but this also appears to be a less common occurrence, reflecting the difficulty in engaging a small and relatively slow-moving target, especially at low levels. The same F-15 pilot stated that while drones have on occasion been shot down using AIM-9 missiles, a gun kill “is possible but often [the] most difficult.” A Royal Saudi Air Force pilot performs a pre-flight inspection on an F-15S, at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, during Red Flag 10.4. , U.S. Air Force/ Master Sgt. Kevin J. Gruenwald The Houthi drones — Qasef series and others — are frequently launched against Saudi targets just across the country’s southern border with Yemen but the rebels are also able to strike deep within Saudi territory, putting the capital Riyadh at risk, as well as military bases, airports, leadership targets, and critical oil facilities. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the 2019 drone and missile attack on Saudi oil infrastructure , although the U.S. government subsequently blamed Iran directly for that particular operation. Damage inflicted on an Airbus A320 airliner operated by the Saudi airline Flyadeal after a drone attack by Houthi rebels on Abha International Airport in the south of Saudi Arabia on February 10 this year., VIA TWITTER As for the numbers of drones being encountered, the Missile Threat project run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has not recently updated its Yemen conflict database , but to take just one day from last year — July 12 — by way of example, Saudi air defenses reportedly intercepted six bomb-laden drones and two ballistic missiles directed at targets including Khamis Mushayt Air Base. The same day, a Houthi spokesman claimed that Houthi missiles and drones targeted “military aircraft, pilot accommodation and Patriot systems in Khamis Mushayt, and other military targets at Abha, Jizan and Najran airports,” as well as an oil facility in Jizan. On March 26 this year, the Houthis claimed they had attacked Saudi energy and military sites using no fewer than 18 armed drones . Their targets apparently included various facilities belonging to Saudi Arabia’s military security forces, as well as oil and other energy industry-related sites. While the Saudi regime clearly finds itself busy waging an expensive war against a low-tech Houthi drone opposition, the same dynamic is one that’s increasingly becoming a worry for other militaries. There are other options to tackle lower-end drones, including various types of ground-based air defense systems , as well as soft-kill systems , although these latter are typically only effective at shorter ranges. But to provide coverage of a wide area, as is the case for Saudi Arabia, a fast jet offers the best response time, as well as being able to investigate airspace incursions. In the future, a directed-energy weapon might provide fighter aircraft with a more cost-effective option for destroying drones of this type. For now, however, Saudi Arabia seems to consider the costly AMRAAM as the best way of engaging in the ongoing drone war with the Houthis.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 1, 2021",Likely Drone Attack On U.S. Power Grid Revealed In New Intelligence Report (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. officials believe that a DJI Mavic 2 , a small quadcopter-type drone, with a thick copper wire attached underneath it via nylon cords was likely at the center of an attempted attack on a power substation in Pennsylvania last year. An internal U.S. government report issued last month says this is the first time such an incident has been officially assessed as a possible drone attack on energy infrastructure in the United States, but that this is likely to become more commonplace as time goes on. This is a reality The War Zone has sounded the alarm about in the past, including when we were first to report on a still-unexplained series of drone flights near the Palo Verde nuclear powerplant in Arizona in 2019. ABC News was first to report on the Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) covering the incident in Pennsylvania last year, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) published on Oct. 28, 2021. The document, which ABC obtained a copy of — but released only a small portion of — is marked unclassified, but some parts are labeled Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) and For Official Use Only (FOUO). Other outlets have since obtained copies of this document, which reportedly says this likely attack took place on July 16, 2020, but it does not identify where the substation in question was located. A portion of an annotated satellite image from a US Joint Intelligence Bulletin regarding a likely attempted drone attack on a power substation in Pennsylvania in 2020., DHS via ABC News “This is the first known instance of a modified UAS [unmanned aerial system] likely being used in the United States to specifically target energy infrastructure,” the JIB states. “We assess that a UAS recovered near an electrical substation was likely intended to disrupt operations by creating a short circuit to cause damage to transformers or distribution lines, based on the design and recovery location.” ABC and other outlets have reported that the JIB says that this assessment is based in part on other unspecified incidents involving drones dating back to 2017. As already noted, The War Zone previously reported on another worrisome set of incidents in 2019 around Arizona’s Palo Verde Generating Station, the largest nuclear power plant in the United States in terms of its electrical output. In the process of reporting that story, we uncovered other reported drone flights that prompted security concerns near the Limerick Generating Station nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania earlier that year. “To date, no operator has been identified and we are producing this assessment now to expand awareness of this event to federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement and security partners who may encounter similarly modified UAS,” the JIB adds. Beyond the copper wire strung up underneath it, the drone reportedly had its camera and internal memory card removed. Efforts were taken to remove any identifying markings, indicating efforts by the operator or operators to conceal the identifies and otherwise make it difficult to trace the drone’s origins. A low-quality image showing the drone recovered after the likely attempted attack in Pennsylvania. The green lines are the nylon cables. A copper wire was attached to the bottom ends of both lines., DHS via ABC News It’s unclear how much of a threat this particular drone posed in its modified configuration. The apparent intended method of attack would appear to be grounded, at least to some degree , in actual science. The U.S. military employed Tomahawk cruise missiles loaded with spools of highly-conductive carbon fiber wire against power infrastructure to create blackouts in Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991. F-117 Nighthawk stealth combat jets dropped cluster bombs loaded with BLU-114/B submunitions packed with graphite filament over Serbia to the same effect in 1999. Regardless, the incident only underscores the ever-growing risks that small drones pose to critical infrastructure, as well as other civilian and military targets, in the United States. If this modified drone did pose a real risk, it would also highlight the low barrier to entry to at least attempt to carry out such attacks. New DJI Mavic 2s can be purchased online right now for between $2,000 and $4,000. The technology is so readily available that non-state actors around the world, from terrorists in the Middle East to drug cartels in Mexico , are already employing commercial quad and hexacopter-type drones armed with improvised explosive payloads on a variety of targets on and off more traditional battlefields . This includes attempted assassinations of high-profile individuals . The U.S. government is finally coming to terms with these threats and there are certainly some steps being taken, at least at the federal level, to protect domestic civilian and military facilities against small drones . At the same time, it is equally clear there is still much work to be done. This particular incident in Pennsylvania last year highlights separate security concerns relating to Chinese-made small drones that are now widely available in the United States and are even in use within the U.S. government . DJI, or Da Jiang Innovations, is by far the largest Chinese drone maker selling products commercially in the United States today, and it has been at the center of these debates in recent years. Whether or not the modified Mavic 2 posed a real danger in this instance or if this was truly the first-ever attempted drone attack on energy infrastructure in the United States, it definitely reflects threats are real now and will only become more dangerous as time goes on.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2021",Germany Still Can’t Give Up Its Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles After Half A Century,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Fifty years young, the German Army’s Marder tracked infantry fighting vehicle, or IFV, was one of the first of its kind to enter service during the revolution in mechanized warfare that took place midway through the Cold War. Now, even with replacement by the more modern Puma IFV well underway, work continues to improve the Marder to ensure it can remain effective in service for years to come. More details of the current service-life extension for the German Army Marder IFV — named for the tree-dwelling marten mammal — were provided recently to Europäische Sicherheit & Technik by Rheinmetall, which now has manufacturing and marketing responsibility for the vehicle. The company has now completed delivery of new MELLS anti-tank guided missiles, or ATGMs, for the more than 70 German Marders that are undergoing a service-life extension. The MELLS is based on the Israeli-designed Spike missile , which can tackle armored targets out to ranges of around 2.5 miles, or 3.4 miles when using the Spike LR (Long Range) version. The latest Marder 1A5A1 version with MELLS anti-tank guided missiles., Rheinmetall At least some of the Marders have already been converted to use MELLS, which replaces the Cold War-era MILAN missile with which they were previously armed. New missiles are just a part of the program to keep a portion of the Marder fleet in active Bundeswehr service, however, in its latest 1A5A1 version. Other new equipment being added to the Marder includes the Hensoldt Spectus multispectral driver’s sight system that combines an uncooled thermal imager with a low-light-level camera, with imagery from both sources merged for improved definition during low visibility. The sight system also has a rearview camera for the driver. Meanwhile, the previous thermal imaging device used for reconnaissance and target engagement, and dating from the 1980s, is being replaced by the Rheinmetall Electronics Saphir 2.6 MK , which was specially designed for the Marder. According to the manufacturer, the higher resolution provided by the new sensor will “significantly improve the observation range and round-the-clock reconnaissance quality.” Enhanced safety features include a new fire-warning and extinguishing system derived from that used in the more modern Puma. Other measures have been taken to improve the crew’s operating environment, with a new cooling system, in which the previous single overhead fan is replaced by three fans on each side. On the powerplant side, a new six-cylinder Liebherr engine is being installed, this providing 750 horsepower compared to 600 horsepower for the original MTU engine. The existing gearbox is being beefed up and updated to accommodate the new engine. Among the other new features are a new battle management system including radios, and new tracks, again the same as used on the Puma. The end result is an armored vehicle that belies its advancing years. After all, the Marder was among the first generation of IFVs, which emerged from sweeping changes in mechanized warfare in the 1950s. Development of what became the Marder began in October 1962 with development contracts calling for an armored vehicle with a capacity for 12 infantry (later reduced to 10, and finally to six or seven) who could fight from within the vehicle or dismounted, a 20mm caliber cannon, plus nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection. The complex path from first prototypes to the service entry of the Marder in 1971., Rheinmetall The first production Marder was handed over to the German Army in May 1971, and deliveries continued at a high tempo, with around 3,000 vehicles in operation by 1975. Initially, none of these were for export, the Marder instead filling out the West German Panzergrenadiere (mechanized infantry) units during the Cold War. The Maschinenbau Kiel AG (MaK) factory hands over one of the first Marder IFVs to the Bundeswehr on May 7, 1971., Stadtarchiv Kiel The vehicle gained a reputation for its good balance of armor protection and cross-country mobility, which allowed it to keep pace with Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks as part of a combined-arms team. Indeed, the design of the Marder proved highly influential in general, and the U.S. Army’s Bradley IFV , for example, has many features in common. The Marder was also notably well-armed for a Western IFV, with the 20mm caliber Rheinmetall cannon in the turret together with a co-axial 7.62mm caliber machine gun, plus another of these machine guns in a remote-controlled turret above the rear troop compartment to provide suppressive fire while dismounting. The MILAN missile was originally fitted in the second half of the 1970s, chiefly as a way of countering what was then a new class of Soviet main battle tanks with superior armor protection. This weapon had a range of around 1.2 miles, or around half that of the baseline Spike. The basic chassis design of the Marder was also used for other armored vehicle developments, including the Roland low-level surface-to-air missile system, and even a medium tank, the TAM for Argentina. Argentinian Army TAM (Tanque Argentino Mediano) medium tanks on maneuvers., Argentinian Ministry of Defense While the end of the Cold War saw the reunified German Army greatly reduced in size and prestige, the Marder soldiered on in reduced numbers, serving in a peacekeeping role in the former Yugoslavia in the late 1990s before taking part in its first true combat deployment in Afghanistan beginning in 2007. The Marder generally gave a good account of itself in this campaign, despite having been developed for an entirely different fighting environment. A German Army Marder crosses the Kunduz River in Afghanistan in May 2010. , Bundeswehr/Piz Kunduz The manufacture provides the following account of the Marder’s service in Afghanistan: “Owing to tactical considerations, the Marder IFV was often deployed in mixed formations together with wheeled vehicles like the Dingo . Besides security missions, the Marder IFV often served as an armored reserve in flanking operations. Due to the bulky equipment, the fighting compartment generally carried only four soldiers at most. The open, occasionally broken terrain of northern Afghanistan suited the Marder IFV very well; the irrigation ditches and typical earthen walls around the compounds generally posed no obstacle. The Marder IFV encountered problems only when the enemy enjoyed local superiority in ambush situations involving large IEDs [improved explosive devices] and concentrated RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] fire. And then there was the terrible heat: in the rear of the fighting compartment, temperatures of up to 80°C [176°F] were measured. This is why the fighting compartments of all 35 Marder IFVs deployed were equipped with air conditioning systems starting in 2010.” A video documenting the return of the final Marders from Afghanistan in 2013: Moreover, with continued delays and cost overruns with the replacement Puma, the Marder has remained in frontline German service with the aid of progressive upgrades, most recently the 1A5A1 standard. Although the Puma was approved for service in April 2015, it wasn’t until March 2021 that the Chief of Staff of the German Army declared the new IFV to be combat-ready. Now, deliveries of the 350 Pumas on order are nearing completion, but the limited availability of the upgraded Very High Readiness Joint Task Force ( VJTF ) 2023 standard, required for NATO deployments, has driven the ongoing Marder upgrades, to bridge the gap. Clearly, the German Army considers that the Marder still has more useful life in it, despite its veteran status, and the price tag of $122 million to provide 78 upgrade packages represents good value. These kits are being integrated on 71 Marders that are receiving a new powerplant, based around the more powerful Liebherr engine. Work is due to be completed by 2023.  As well as these 71 vehicles undergoing the full upgrade, many more are still in the inventory: For example, Saphir 2.6 MK thermal sights have been purchased for 244 Marders. Plans call for the upgraded Marder to serve alongside the Puma “for several more years,” according to Rheinmetall. A German Army soldier demonstrates the Future Soldier — Expanded System (IdZ-ES) kit in front of a Puma IFV. , Rheinmetall Outside Germany, however, the Marder is likely to remain in service even longer. While it wasn’t exported for many years, the IFV has since been sold to Chile, Jordan, and Indonesia. Between them, these nations have received around 300 Marders and represent a potential market for further upgrade packages, such as the 1A5A1 standard. In addition, Rheinmetall still has stocks of around 250 Marder 1A3 vehicles available for sale — and upgrade. With that in mind, it’s very likely troops will continue to train to ride into battle aboard the Marder well beyond its 60th anniversary, likely aided by at least some of the upgrades now being integrated on the German Army’s vehicles.

Brian O'Rourke,"Posted on Sep 17, 2021",Australia Could Push To Acquire Retired US Navy Los Angeles Class Nuclear Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The recently signed Australia–United Kingdom–United States defense agreement, or AUKUS, calls for the United States and Britain to share nuclear-submarine technology with Australia. Although the agreement was light on details of what, when, and how , plans apparently are for Australia to eventually build at least eight nuclear-powered attack submarines . In the interim, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is now advocating for Australia to obtain used nuclear submarines to get the sharing started so as to spin up the Royal Australian Navy’s submarine capabilities and nuclear know-how. Australia has never had a nuclear power plant of any kind. Speaking last Friday at a Wilson Center event in Washington, D.C., Abbott suggested that, in the short term, Australia should consider leasing or purchasing one or more existing U.S. submarines to develop Australia’s capability to operate nuclear-powered submarines. Abbott has posed the question, “Might it be possible for Australia to acquire a retiring [ Los Angeles ] class boat or two and to put it under an Australian flag and to run it, if you like, as an operational training boat?” Abbott added that he’d make a similar proposal for British nuclear-powered submarines “were I in London.” “It would, in that capacity, be — if you like — an addition to the order of battle in the western Pacific, should that be necessary,” he added. The U.S. Navy has experience turning Los Angeles -class submarines into floating schoolhouses. This past summer, the ex-USS San Francisco completed its conversion from a nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) to a moored training ship, MTS-711 , now operating in Charleston, South Carolina. There it joined the converted former USS La Jolla , which began its new life in this training role last year. And while Abbott clearly is calling for a deployable vessel, not an MTS, if two subs were obtained, a moored training ship might be a valuable teaching tool to add. The USS San Francisco in Norfolk Naval Shipyard near the end of its conversion from a nuclear-powered attack submarine to a moored training ship., NNSY/Tony Anderson Potential candidates for such a lease might include: the USS Providence (SSN-719), scheduled to be decommissioned this coming December; and the Oklahoma City (SSN-723), scheduled to decommission in June 2022. Two additional submarines —  the ex- Pittsburgh (SSN-720) and the former Louisville (SSN-724) — were decommissioned in April 2020 and March 2021, respectively, but both might be too far along in the disposal process to be diverted and restored. All four submarines are equipped with vertical-launch systems (VLS) for Tomahawk cruise missiles. Pittsburgh and Providence were both commissioned in 1985. Louisville was commissioned in 1986, and Oklahoma City was commissioned in 1988. Two Flight I boats, which lack the VLS and other improvements, also retired in 2021: the Bremerton (SSN-698) and Olympia (SSN-717). According to SeaPower magazine, the next tranche of “688 boats” to face the breaker’s yard will be: the USS Chicago (SSN-721), Key West (SSN-722), San Juan (SSN-751), and Topeka (SSN-754), in fiscal year 2024. The San Juan and Topeka , which entered service in 1988 and 1989, respectively, are the first of the improved “688i” submarines to be scheduled for decommissioning. The “improved” boats have better sensors and quieting technology, and, most notably, moved the dive planes from the sail to the bow, into which they can retract. Britain has retired four of its seven Trafalgar class attack submarines. A fifth, HMS Trenchant , has been laid up since March, but is not yet officially decommissioned. HMS Talent received a significant upgrade in 2018, and Jane’s reported in March 2021 that the boat would be extended one year beyond its previously announced 2021 retirement, while the final sub in the class, HMS Triumph , would get an 18-month reprieve beyond its planned 2022 retirement. Both extensions were reportedly caused by delays in the follow-on Astute class . Observers watch the Royal Navy submarine HMS Talent conducting Dive and Surface Drills in the Kyle of Lochalsh, Scotland. The Trafalgar class submarine is due to retire in the next two to three years and could be a candidate for transfer to Australia., CROWN COPYRIGHT It is not known what anticipated life is left in the nuclear fuel and reactors on any of the U.S. or U.K. boats, but it seems probable the submarines would require major work in that area. Refueling and overhaul (ROH) is an extremely expensive endeavor that requires the submarine’s hull to be cut open. During the refueling process, the ship’s systems are upgraded and overhauled as well. Considering the limited options, this could be necessary under such a near-term procurement scheme. The good news is that there is a well-established process in place to do it, although extending the submarine’s life beyond what has been realized in the past is another factor to contend with. On the other hand, finding dry dock time and the resources for ROHs for the Los Angeles class boats outside of those already planned would be challenging. And the rules for transferring a nuclear-powered vessel to a foreign power are uncharted waters. The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Asheville (SSN 758) transits Apra Harbor in Jan. 2021 as the boat deploys from Guam to conduct surveillance, training, and other critical missions for the U.S. 7th Fleet., U.S. Navy / MC2 Kelsey J. Hockenberger There has already been an appalling backlog of maintenance for America’s submarine fleet. The USS Boise (SSN-764), for example, has been waiting its turn for maintenance since fiscal year 2016 . Making time for an allies’ needs, on top of the Navy’s growing demands , could become a major issue. The Congressional Budget Office already estimates that the U.S. submarine fleet’s “size will exceed the yards’ capacity to maintain it, not only over the next several years but in 25 of the next 30 years.” Still, strategic imperatives could trump these concerns, and the United States might make getting Australia in the nuclear submarine game as fast as possible a top priority. Australia has expressed interest in building its future nuclear-powered submarines domestically, in whole or in part. This may be just as well, given that General Dynamics’ Electric Boat division is already at or near capacity building submarines for the U.S. Navy, although British builders might be better positioned to increase their output — if they can avoid further delays in the Astute program. Australia seems likely to base its submarine on a mature design such as the U.S. Virginia class or U.K. Astute class . Given the long lead time for building such complex and specialized warships — not to mention creating the infrastructure necessary to do so  — many analysts think it could take until 2040 or later before the first new nuclear-powered submarine enters Royal Australian Navy service. This makes Abbot’s suggestion of buying or leasing an existing sub or two intriguing, to say the least. HMS Ambush , the second of the Royal Navy’s potent new Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarines, sails into Her Majesty’s Naval Base Clyde., CROWN COPYRIGHT Abbott, a member of the Liberal Party, is a former prime minister who served from 2013 to 2015 — coinciding with the rise of Xi Jinping in China — the same party as current Prime Minister Scott Morrison. While Abbott is not a member of the present Australian government, it seems unlikely he would speak openly about the submarine proposal without at least an informal blessing of Australia’s Foreign and Defence Ministries, which are both headed by fellow Liberals. At the Wilson Center event, Abbott described himself as “like everyone else— until probably the end of 2015, I was a China optimist. We all thought for a long time that China and the West were on … converging paths.” China became the largest customer for Australian exports, he said, but then “weaponized trade against Australia.” And now, he noted, “China is stepping up its intimidation of Taiwan all the time. In the few days before my [early October] visit [to Taiwan], there was something like 150 Chinese warplanes dispatched into the Taiwanese air [defense identification] zones. I expect that [such behavior] will get more intense.” Abbott was referring to a speech he gave in Taipei on Oct. 7, during which he used remarkably candid language. “Australia has no issue with China,” he said. “We welcome trade, investment, and visits — just not further hectoring about being the chewing gum on China’s boot.” He went on to add, “Victor Gao, a senior Beijing foreign policy analyst and former translator for Chairman Deng [Xiaoping] directly threatened Australians.‘Do you want to be a target for a possible nuclear war?’ he said, in response to our decision to acquire nuclear-powered but not [nuclear-]armed submarines. So, if the drums of war can be heard in our region — as an official of ours has noted, it’s not Australia that’s beating them. The only drums we beat are for justice and freedom.” Regardless of the percussion metaphors, it seems Australia may want to consummate its nuclear submarine alliance sooner than some may have expected. Author’s note: A reader emailed to point out that, while the statement above that Australia has never had a nuclear power plant is correct, the country does have a single nuclear reactor for research and medical purposes. It is not connected to the power grid. Contact the author: Brian@thedrive.com Brian O'Rourke Los Angeles Class Navies Nuclear Attack Submarines (SSNs) Sea Submarines U.S. Navy"
