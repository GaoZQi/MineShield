Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 3, 2020",Air Force F-15Es Train To Launch Cruise Missiles Over The Baltic Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force recently led a major exercise in and around Europe that also included elements from other branches of the U.S. military and various NATO allies. The event included F-15E Strike Eagle crews going through the tactics, techniques, and procedures that would be involved in carrying out cruise missile strikes in the strategic Baltic Sea region, home to a major Russian military outpost , using AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, or JASSMs. There was also a base defense scenario centered on protecting against incoming missile and drone strikes, in which F-35 Joint Strike Fighters helped move important data between personnel at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany and U.S. Army air and missile defense units. U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) led the exercise, which was described as a test of the U.S. military’s new Combined, Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) concept. CJADC2 is an extension of the service’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), a multi-faceted over-arching effort focused on improving networking and associated capabilities. The Department of the Air Force’s Chief Architect’s Office, which directly supported this recent USAFE event, is in charge of managing ABMS together with the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). This demonstration in Europe also served as the fourth so-called “on-ramp” event for the ABMS program, previous examples of which have been intended to showcase various new and improved technologies working together within this broader architecture, according to Air Force Magazine . An F-15E Strike Eagle with an AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) cruise missile loaded on its centerline pylon during a test in the United States in 2020., USAF “Conducting a complex and real-world focused CJADC2 demonstration allowed our joint and allied team to find areas where we can innovate with systems we already have and also to identify areas where our warfighters need assistance from the Air and Space Forces’ Chief Architect’s Office,” Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, head of USAFE, said in a statement. “There are areas where we can continue to improve and where technology can help us streamline our network systems to ensure all of our disparate networks can communicate and ease the workload on our Airmen.” “Future conflicts will be with technologically advanced adversaries – and will be contested – so a distributed but integrated system of command and control is critical if we’re to compete and win,” Preston Dunlap, the Department of the Air Force’s Chief Architect, added. “Our USAFE counterparts working with our allies and partners during this CJADC2 event was extremely productive and helped us push the ball down the field on digitally connecting the joint force.” A core component of the CJADC2 exercise in Europe was a mock operation using a force package made up of F-15E Strike Eagles and F-15C Eagles from the 48th Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom. It’s not clear whether the F-15Es were actually carrying AGM-158 JASSMs, either inert or live, but the scenario involved them preparing to strike targets in the Baltic Sea region. Strike Eagles are a go-to platform for employing these highly capable stealthy cruise missiles, something you can read about in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . The F-15Cs, which are not capable of carrying out air-to-ground operations, would have been acting as escorts, but the Air Force did not confirm this. In line with the core network objectives of the demonstration, “the U.S. and U.K. also provided intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance airborne assets to support the targeting and command and control,” including an E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) battle management aircraft, during this particular segment of the exercise, according to the Air Force. “These assets were able to integrate targeting and sensor information with other Air Force entities, including the 603rd Air Operations Center and the Deployable Ground System , as well as joint assets from the U.S. Army and a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon .” A US Air Force E-8C JSTARS battle management aircraft at Ramstein Air Force Base during the recent CJADC2 demonstration., USAF The service also did not specify what the F-15Es targeted during the exercise. However, the Baltic Sea region is notably home to Russia’s strategic, geographically separated Kaliningrad enclave , which is situated between Poland and Lithuania. Those countries, as well as the other two Baltic States of Estonia and Latvia, are all NATO members. Kaliningrad is effectively a large military base that serves as the headquarters for the Russian Navy’s Baltic Sea fleet , as well as a forward staging point for combat aircraft, ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles , and anti-ship and anti-aircraft defenses. It is an important node in the Kremlin’s regional anti-access and area-denial posture. The Baltic Sea also leads to the Gulf of Finland and St. Petersburg, another major Russian naval hub. In addition, while we can say for sure what the targets laid out in this demonstration might have been, it’s worth remembering that the Air Force admitted last year to conducting an exercise in the Black Sea in which Air Force B-1B bombers practiced the tactics, techniques, and procedures required for the employment of the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), a derivative of the JASSM. This was a message aimed at Russia, and its Black Sea fleet, specifically. Regardless, in the event of any major conflict in the Baltic region with Russia, Air Force cruise missile strikes would be an important way to target Russian defenses, helping to pave the way for follow-on strikes, as well as other critical assets in and around the Baltic. The Air Force said that the base defense portion of the CJADC2 exercise occurred simultaneously with the cruise missile and drone segment, but it is not clear if the former was meant to reflect a response to the latter. We also don’t know what types of cruise missile threats the service simulated during the demonstration. However, A-4 Skyhawk aggressor jets from the private adversary air support services company Top Aces took part in the exercise. Often times aircraft like this are used to simulate incoming subsonic cruise missiles . An A-4 Aggressor Jet belonging to private company Top Aces flies near Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany during the recent CJADC2 exercise., USAF Pictures the Air Force subsequently released showed the use of small quad and hexcopter-type drones, as well. These kinds of unmanned systems can be relatively easily modified to carry small munitions in addition to being able to carry out surveillance and otherwise harass friendly forces . When operating in groups, especially large swarms , they represent very real threats to U.S. forces at home and abroad, something The War Zone has highlighted on multiple occasions in the past. Some of these drones may also have been used to provide additional situational awareness for friendly forces during the exercise. A DJI Mavic 2 quadcopter drone in flight during the CJADC2 exercise. , USAF A hexcopter drone provided by the Georgia Tech Research Institute in use during the demonstration., USAF “ Dutch F-35 Lightning IIs also participated in the demonstration as communication links between base defense arrays [at Ramstein] as well as the 10th Army Air [and] Missile Defense Command,” the service said about that part of the demonstration. There have been multiple demonstrations in the past involving the use of F-35s as platforms to provide offboard targeting information, as well as communications relay nodes, including in support of missile defense operations. The Joint Strike Fighter offers an impressive array of sensor and other data fusion capabilities that make it an ideal choice for this kind of mission. The 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC) primarily oversees the service’s air and missile defense assets in Germany, which including Patriot surface-to-air missiles and Avenger short-range point-defense systems. However, the command also serves as centralized air and missile defense manager in Europe and has supported the deployment of other assets, including Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) batteries, to the region in the past. Ramstein is notably home to an Air Force element charged with testing and evaluation expeditionary base defense concepts, called the Ramstein Air Base Air Defense System Integration Lab, or RADSIL. Since December 2019, RADSIL has support tests and demonstrations of various radars and other sensors, as well as command and control systems. A previously released briefing slide, which Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor, posted on Twitter last year, said that the lab planned to contribute a command and control system to this recent exercise that would feature the Lattice artificial intelligence-driven sensor and data fusion architecture from defense contractor Anduril . It was also expected to provide “automated decision support” for the demonstration. A briefing slide showing various plans for base defense work at the Ramstein Air Base Air Defense System Integration Lab, or RADSIL., USAF One of the Air Force’s main goals for ABMS has been to find ways to better link “sensors and shooters” to not only shorten the time it takes to react to threats, but also engage them in the most efficient manner. The Army has also been working along similar lines as part of its Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . It’s also interesting to note that Ramstein experienced a still largely unexplained incident last year in which various kinds of alerts were issued about an incoming missile strike. The Air Force later said that a missile launch had occurred in the region, but that the base and its surrounding communities were never in any danger. The service has still not confirmed who fired the missile that triggered the entire affair, which might have been launched as a part of a Russian drill that was taking place at the time, or how and why the false alarm occurred as a result. Other Air Force elements, in Europe and the United States, also supported the demonstration. This included the service’s Kessel Run software incubator , which supplied a “Command and Control, Incident Management, and Emergency Response Application,” and the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana that “contributed by exploring various communication methodologies and technologies in support of a common operating picture.” The Space Force, the U.S. military’s newest branch, also took part, with the 16th Space Control Squadron at the Peterson-Schriever Garrison in Colorado providing what was described as “Multiband Assessment of the Communication Environment.” USAFE Commander General Harrigian said that private company SpaceX took part in the demonstration with its Starlink broadband internet satellite constellation, which has been a feature in previous ABMS events , as well, according to Air Force Magazine . It is worth remembering that the over-arching CJADC2 and ABMS architectures, among others being developed across the U.S. military, such as the Army’s IBCS, remain very much in development. At the same time, as this demonstration highlights, many of the components the services want to link together are already in use to various degrees. “A truly connected joint force can’t happen without strong partnerships with our combatant commands and major commands in overseas theaters,” Dunlap, the Air and Space Forces’ Chief Architect, said. “Our methodology for these Department of the Air Force demonstrations is to take our technology to the warfighter and to iterate and innovate alongside them during these demonstration sprints.” Exercises like this one in Europe only underscore the immense value that could be had by adding greater network connectivity between such diverse assets.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jun 18, 2021",U.S. ‘Not Prepared To Defend Or Compete’ With China On AI According To Commission Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, or NCSAI, issued a report on Monday, March 1, 2021, which offers a stark warning to the leadership of the United States. According to the thorough 756-page report, China could likely soon replace the U.S. as the world’s leader in artificial intelligence , or AI, and that shift will have significant ramifications for the U.S. military at home and abroad. The full text of the report is listed on the NCSAI website. The NCSAI was established by the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and was established to consider the methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and associated technologies to comprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States.” Google CEO Eric Schmidt chaired the NCSAI alongside researchers, executives from private industry, and scientists from academia, Silicon Valley, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Department of Defense. A full list of the NSCAI commissioners can be found here . Various threats posed by different types of AI weapons and tools cited in the report., NSCAI In the opening letter to the NSCAI report published this week, Schmidt and Vice Chair Robert Work, Former Deputy Secretary of Defense, issued the stern warning that “America is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era,” adding that it will take many different sectors working together to confront America’s lack of preparedness and expertise: This is the tough reality we must face. And it is this reality that demands comprehensive, whole-of-nation action. Our final report presents a strategy to defend against AI threats, responsibly employ AI for national security, and win the broader technology competition for the sake of our prosperity, security, and welfare. The U.S. government cannot do this alone. It needs committed partners in industry, academia, and civil society. And America needs to enlist its oldest allies and new partners to build a safer and freer world for the AI era. There is already progress being made in terms of integrating AI into the national security arena and the U.S. military, but significant institutional roadblocks remain. The NSCAI report states that despite the progress being made in the private sector in terms of AI tools, “visionary technologists and warfighters largely remain stymied by antiquated technology, cumbersome processes, and incentive structures that are designed for outdated or competing aims.” In order to be prepared to confront an AI-driven global battlespace in the future, the report writes, the Department of Defense (DoD) must embrace a near-paradigm shift in terms of its institutional culture: The obstacles to integrating AI are many. DoD has long been hardware-oriented toward ships, planes, and tanks. It is now trying to make the leap to a software-intensive enterprise. Spending remains concentrated on legacy systems designed for the industrial age and Cold War. Many Departmental processes still rely too much on PowerPoint and manually driven work streams. The data that is needed to fuel machine learning (ML) is currently stovepiped, messy, or often discarded. Platforms are disconnected. Acquisition, development, and fielding practices largely follow rigid, sequential processes, inhibiting early and continuous experimentation and testing critical for AI. The DoD, and the USAF in particular, have been developing AI tools in recent years with a focus on use in sensors and navigation , autonomous UAV resupply missions , and potentially even unmanned combat aerial vehicles . Last year, an AI-controlled virtual F-16 defeated a top Air Force fighter pilot in each of five rounds of virtual dogfighting, while the USAF also awarded Boeing, General Atomics, and Kratos with contracts to build the autonomous “loyal wingman” drones that will soon fly alongside human airmen. These are far from the only types of uses of AI the DoD is eyeing, and in fact, they represent only a small segment of the potential applications of AI on the battlefield. As noted in this graphic from the report, AI comes in a wide variety of forms, tools, and applications., NSCAI The NSCAI report specifically cites AI-enabled and autonomous weapon systems of all types, not just autonomous aerial vehicles, noting that “the global, unchecked use of such systems could increase risks of unintended conflict escalation and crisis instability.” In particular, the report cites increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons, commercial drones armed with AI software “smart weapons” that can wreak havoc on infrastructure, and AI-enabled “weapons of mass influence” designed to sow discord among the U.S. populace. While the authors of the report note that competition can be a positive force when it comes to technological innovation, American leadership should be wary of Chinese advances in AI due to the fact that “the AI competition is also a values competition.” The report notes that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is already using artificial intelligence as a “ tool of repression and surveillance ” both at home and abroad and that “China’s plans, resources, and progress should concern all Americans.” The report notes that although Russia does not attempt to steal U.S. technologies and intellectual property on the same scale as China, the Russian government remains an “aggressive and capable collector of technologies” that could field AI weapons just rapidly as its Chinese counterparts. America’s two main adversaries are just as keenly aware of how AI supremacy could lead to battlefield supremacy and are making just as much investment into AI as the new NSCAI report recommends America does. In 2017, the Chinese government issued a statement that technological advances, including in AI, would make China the global leader by 2030. “By 2030, our country will reach a world-leading level in artificial intelligence theory, technology and application and become a principal world center for artificial intelligence innovation,” the CCP claimed. That same year, Russian President Vladimir Putin made similar comments , claiming that the path to global supremacy is paved with AI. “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,” Putin said. “It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Both Russia and China are developing their own unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and both have been accused of leveraging AI-powered cyberattacks or misinformation campaigns against the United States. Among the many recommendations the report makes, in order to counteract this rising foreign AI threat, one is bolstering the U.S. talent base through a new National Defense Education Act, scaling up digital talent in government, and establishing a domestic manufacturing base for microelectronics. Currently, the U.S. is almost entirely reliant on foreign-made electronics to power most of its technologies, both in the defense and consumer sectors. This has become an ever-worrying national security issue, as addressed in a January 2021 Executive Order aimed at mitigating the threats posed by foreign-made drone technologies or even foreign-made subsystems used in drones. NSCAI The commission advises the U.S. government to more than double the amount of money it invests in AI R&D by 2026, aiming for $32 billion a year. The authors also recommended a huge boost in funding to institutions like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in order to sponsor research projects that address emerging AI threats and ways to mitigate them; establishing a Steering Committee on Emerging Technology, tri-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence; and adding an additional $17.5 million to the DoD budget to support “innovative concept development.” In addition, the report recommends that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) pay a much closer watch to foreign investments in American technology research. The report’s key takeaway is that the Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) must be “AI-ready” by 2025, and that a significant talent deficit in those organizations is among the chief roadblocks in terms of U.S. preparedness for an AI-driven battlefield and future. This AI-readiness includes a widespread integration of AI tools throughout the DoD and IC and a significant focus on training, recruiting, and retaining the best talent from all related industries. NSCAI While wars have for centuries been largely decided by which side possesses the best hardware, we are entering a brave new future in which software will hold the key to global supremacy. As we have noted with many other topics in our previous reporting , the laborious slow pace of procurement and innovation among the DoD has left the United States lagging behind in terms of its preparedness to face AI threats. Whether or not the NSCAI’s recommendations can help correct that course will no doubt be seen in the next international conflict that sees American AI-enabled tools face off against those of its peer rivals.

Joseph Trevithick and Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Sep 10, 2021",The Marines’ New CH-53K Helicopter Isn’t Allowed To Spend More Than 70 Seconds In A Dust Cloud,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is currently significantly limiting the amount of time its new CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter can spend flying in dust clouds or so-called brownout conditions of the kind often experienced in sandy and dusty environments. The service is meanwhile taking measures to address concerns about degrading engine performance after 21 minutes of exposure to these conditions across any number of successive sorties, which threatens to seriously impact the helicopter’s planned mission spectrum. The issues came to light in the most recent annual Director Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) report, which you find in full here , and the U.S. Navy — whose Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) oversees the CH-53K program on behalf of the Marine Corps — has since confirmed to The War Zone that these problems are ongoing. A CH-53K lands after a test flight at the Lockheed Martin facility in West Palm Beach, Florida., U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Molly Hampton “The Developmental Test report published on September 10, 2020, indicates engine performance degrades below acceptable minimums after 21 minutes of exposure to brownout conditions,” DOT&E’s report, published in January, stated regarding the CH-53K. “The aircraft’s operating manual limits permissible engine exposure to brownout during a maneuver to 70 seconds.” Since the CH-53K is billed as the most powerful helicopter in the U.S. Department of Defense’s stable, it will be expected to fly in these conditions both operationally and during training. “Engine performance degradation in brownout conditions will necessitate extremely frequent engine replacements and repair if the Marine Corps continues to train and operate in locations where brownout conditions are prevalent,” the report continued. “CH-53K aircrew cannot realistically perform external cargo delivery operations within the 70-second operating limit.” Brownout conditions are, by now, a regular feature of military helicopter operations, especially in support of amphibious warfare or special operations, of the kind that the CH-53K will be expected to undertake. The recent campaigns in Afghanistan and the Middle East, in particular, have required helicopter crews to frequently work in these hazardous conditions created when sand or dust particles are swept up in the rotor downwash and obscure the pilot’s vision of the terrain; the same conditions are also found elsewhere, too, including in island environments in the Pacific region . At the same time, there has been a range of technical solutions developed to meet these challenges, including enhanced situational awareness equipment and automatic flight control systems, both of which the CH-53K possesses. As evidenced in the video below, the CH-53K has previously been tested in reduced visibility landing (RVL) conditions, which are considered an essential capability for the Marines. Indeed, the Marines have stated that the CH-53K’s “most notable attribute is its ability to maintain increased performance margins in a degraded aeronautical environment.” That includes moving slung loads in these conditions, which the DOT&E report states is not currently possible. Moving external loads is critical to the CH-53K, which cannot carry its maximum load using internal volume alone. In light of the current engine performance problem, it should be noted that picking cargo up and then delivering it will take more than 70 seconds, meaning these maneuvers will not be possible in brownout conditions. If it’s no longer feasible to sling loads in and out of areas where there are brownout concerns, then that will have a major impact on operational planning and it will negate a huge aspect of the CH-53K’s capability set. Moreover, the problem of CH-53K engine performance during brownout conditions could mean that engine performance rapidly degrades below acceptable minimums and the helicopter then needs some sort of maintenance intervention, reducing availability and increasing the burden on spares and servicing. According to the DOT&E report, “extremely frequent engine replacements and repair” will be necessary if the Marine Corps continues to “train and operate in locations where brownout conditions are prevalent.” With all this in mind, the Navy says it has assembled an “engineering tiger team” to address the problem. The Navy also told The War Zone that the figure of 21 minutes cited in the DOT&E report is a cumulative one across any number of sorties, but is also “an early engineering estimate that has not been proven or validated at this point.” Although NAVAIR says that it doesn’t know for sure what that total time might eventually be, that average 21-minute exposure stated in the report is especially important considering that an individual helicopter will likely be making multiple trips to and from specific locations during operations. In the meantime, a risk analysis is ongoing to determine exactly what kind of exposure to brownout conditions the CH-53K can cope with. “The interim time limit to sand/dust exposure has been imposed to provide protection against engine degradation while the tiger team determines the best path forward,” a Navy official said. A CH-53E Super Stallion — which the CH-53K is slated to replace — carries a decommissioned assault amphibious vehicle, weighing nearly 25,000 pounds, across the desert floor at Al Asad, Iraq., U.S. Marine Corps “The CH-53K will continue engineering investigation, ground testing and flight test in sand and dust in order to safely expand the operational envelope,” the Navy spokesperson added. “This effort represents a normal progression from developmental flight test to an operational fleet envelope.” Lockheed Martin, the parent company of the Sikorsky division responsible for the CH-53K, provided The War Zone with the following statement in relation to the current issues: Sikorsky and our customer continue to operate an integrated test plan and are committed to enter Initial Operational Test & Evaluation as planned in June, support operational deployment and expand production of this all-new heavy-lift helicopter. The team is already addressing technical issues cited in the report, a majority of which have been resolved, and are confident we have solutions to address the few outstanding issues to enter into IOT&E as scheduled this year. As regards the particulars of the problems in brownout conditions, the Lockheed Martin spokesperson added: “We understand the sand ingestion issue and, as the aircraft integrator, have assigned a dedicated team of our most experienced engineers to work alongside NAVAIR and General Electric to resolve this issue.” It is worth noting, too, that the Marine Corps’ MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor has also experienced similar problems in the past, exacerbated by the considerable quantities of dust kicked up when it’s close to the ground. A Department of Defense Inspector General report in 2019 underlined the fact that the service was still struggling to overcome these problems , which had been known about since at least 2010. A U.S. Marine Corps MV-22B Osprey conducts slung-load operations., U.S. Marine Corps The CH-53K’s current engine problem in brownout conditions can be added to a list of concerns that have afflicted the program, which seeks to field a successor to the aging CH-53E, and which has also recently been selected by Israel to replace that country’s legacy CH-53/S-65 fleet. The Marine Corps alone plans to buy 200 examples. While the Marine Corps took delivery of its first CH-53K in May 2018 , NAVAIR admitted the following January that it wasn’t sure when the Marines would be able to declare initial operational capability (IOC) with the new helicopter, due to technical issues. Back then, these included exhaust gasses being sucked back into the engines, problems with the main drive shaft and tail rotor assemblies, and main rotor gearboxes that were failing well before they were supposed to. However, the engine and gearbox issues have since been addressed. A U.S. Marine Corps CH-53K King Stallion., U.S. Marine Corps Compounded by these problems through the years, the estimated unit cost of the CH-53K has continued to rise . Already a monumentally expensive helicopter , the Pentagon 2021 Fiscal Year budget request placed its unit cost at around $125 million . At one point, the Marine Corps expected the CH-53K to achieve initial operational capability in 2015, before that was pushed back until 2019, in part due to the aforementioned gearbox issues. The most recent publicly available Marine Aviation Plan, released in 2019, anticipated the service would reach IOC with the first CH-53K detachment in Fiscal Year 2024. In the past, the U.S. Congress has even called upon the Pentagon to examine potential alternatives to the CH-53K, including the CH-47 Chinook . Since then, Boeing has begun flight tests of a CH-47 equipped with more powerful General Electric T408 engines that are used in the CH-53K. So far, however, the Marines have remained committed to the CH-53K, which, once fully operational, will offer capabilities well in advance of the existing CH-53E, including lifting almost triple the baseline E-model lift capacity. A CH-47 fitted with the new T408 engines for testing., U.S. Army While the CH-53K’s current inability to operate for prolonged periods in brownout conditions strikes another blow to a program that has had its fair share of issues, the Navy is confident that “the tiger team will work through the findings, develop a resolution, and see that the fleet receives a reliable heavy-lift platform [the Marines] will use for decades.” It isn’t clear at this time how this issue will impact interest from potential export customers, chief among which is Germany . Only time will tell whether this problem turns out to be simply another hurdle of a comprehensive developmental flight test program, or whether its effects prove to be more far-reaching. However it pans out one thing is certain, the CH-53K is absolutely critical for the USMC. The program cannot fail as the capability it possesses is absolutely essential to the Corps’ mission. In other words, they need to figure out a way to make it work, one way or another, and they still have a few years to make sure that it does.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Apr 28, 2021",F-15E Strike Eagles May Have Yet Another Role: Smart Bomb Transporter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The idea of an aircraft hauling huge quantities of munitions to serve as a “bomb truck” or “arsenal plane” has gained a lot of traction in recent years. But now the U.S. Air Force is trialing something a little different, with an F-15E Strike Eagle loaded up with weapons, not necessarily for strikes, but for rapid delivery to forward bases in a combat zone. The Air Force announced today that the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES), the “Skulls,” part of the 53rd Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida had demonstrated the F-15E’s ability to carry 15 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) of various types on a single sortie back on February 22. This was a proof of concept for the service’s Agile Combat Employment initiative, or ACE, which seeks to enhance its independence from well-established airfields, which are increasingly held at risk by potential foes such as China and Russia. On the left, Major Andrew Swanson, director for the test and F-15E Weapons System Officer, and on the right Major Kevin Fogler, the F-15E pilot who flew the test sortie. Both are assigned to the 85th TES. , U.S. AIR FORCE “Strike Eagle can now carry enough JDAMs for an active combat mission, land at a remote location, and reload itself and/or another aircraft — such as an F-35 or F-22 — for additional combat sorties,” explained Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Lindaman, commander of the 85th TES. A photo released together with the press release shows the left-hand side of the F-15E test jet toting six 500-pound-class GBU-38/B JDAMs , in two rows of three, attached to its Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs). While the bottom row of three is standard for the jet, the top row is the new addition. It means that the total capacity is increased from nine to 15 JDAMs — another three JDAM series weapons (either GBU-38s or 2,000-pound-class GBU-31/Bs ) can be carried under the fuselage and under the wings. That top row capacity previously existed on the F-15E, but could only accommodate unguided ordnance. It’s for that reason that the aircraft lacks the interfaces to actually deliver precision-guided munitions from those hardpoints. As for the CFTs themselves, these have long been a feature on the F-15E. However, as you can read about more here , they have always been an option for the air defense-optimized F-15C/D , as well. The new weapons load-out comes with a caveat, however. While the bottom row of bombs on each side can be dropped on a target, the upper row is for transport only. Think of it as a reload. In this way, a Strike Eagle could theoretically go into combat, drop nine JDAMs, and then recover to a forward base where armorers would move the top row of bombs onto the lower racks, and the jet could go back to the fight. An F-15E over Afghanistan in 2008. The jet carries offensive weapons in the form of three one 2,000-pound JDAM, three 500-pound JDAMs, and two 500-pound Paveway laser-guided bombs., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Aaron Allmon Under the new concept of operations that the Air Force has been trialing, that wouldn’t necessarily be a problem. An Air Force spokesperson told The War Zone that the new capability is based on being able to “deploy or employ.” While the fully loaded F-15E could go to war and drop a portion of its new weapons load, it is more likely to serve as a kind of bomb delivery truck, hauling a maximum load of JDAMs to a forward-located base from where they could be loaded on to fifth-generation F-22 or F-35 stealth fighters . For the F-22, this kind of support could be especially relevant. Prior to ACE, the stealth fighter had been proven in the Rapid Raptor concept, which you can read about in this previous article . However, there has always been some question about how sustainable these kinds of fighter packages are, once deployed to a relatively spartan airfield. The ACE concept now being tested could easily fit into existing specific rapid deployment models like these, as well as the future initiatives the Air Force is still developing. The advantages of this approach, compared to using a C-130 Hercules airlifter , for example, for the same job, are manyfold. The F-15E can carry the JDAMs fully assembled and ready to employ once it arrives at its operational location. It also has a smaller footprint and can get there a lot faster. Once in theater, the Strike Eagle can not only provide munitions for other jets but also fly combat missions itself as part of an increased operational tempo. Potentially, other weapons could be ferried in a similar way, too. In this way, a single C-130 is required to transport the personnel required to arm and maintain the combat jets at a remote location, compared to the two that would have previously been required to ferry both airmen and munitions. Using the C-130 model, the JDAMs would also have to be assembled in situ, which is no longer required using the F-15E in ACE mode. The only drawback is the limited range of the F-15E compared to the C-130, and the fact that endurance would also be reduced by the significant weapons payload. While the jet used in the ACE trials has an “ET” tail code, which is the designator for the 96th Test Wing, this test was planned and executed by the 53rd Wing’s 85th TES. , U.S. Air Force It is notable that the ACE demonstrations comes amid an uptick in interest in fighter operations from remote and dispersed locations, with recent field trials having involved both the Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps . For its part, the Air Force has been looking at improving its ability to deploy to a region and rapidly establish new bases . This could be vital in the opening stages of a major war, in which an enemy would likely make concerted efforts to destroy established facilities . A new report released just yesterday by Indo-Pacific Command, meanwhile, calls for the United States and its allies to “develop locations that provide expeditionary airfields for dispersal and ports for distributed fleet operations” as part of a wider strategy to “create temporary windows of localized air and maritime superiority, enabling maneuver.” Clearly, the F-15E with its ACE modifications could play a significant role in campaigns of this type, whether in the Indo-Pacific or elsewhere. There is also the possibility that ACE could be further developed, transforming the F-15E from a combat-capable bomb transporter into a platform able to provide other kinds of immediate logistics support . Just this type of concept had previously been examined when the CFTs — also known as FAST packs — were first being developed for the F-15, with one proposal being cargo-carrying, offering the operator what was essentially a conformal baggage pod. Early FAST pack configurations drawing from the 1970s., PUBLIC DOMAIN In the short term at least, the new F-15E weapons load-out is more likely to be seen moving JDAMs in more permissive environments. Indeed, the director of the test, Major Andrew Swanson, an F-15E Weapons System Officer with the 85th TES, said the new tactic could be employed on operations in as little as one month. Looking further ahead, there is also the potential of the Air Force exploiting the forthcoming and even more capable F-15EX for similar kinds of missions. With the F-15E community always in high demand, with routine deployments to global hotspots to undertake a range of high-profile missions , it might not be long before we see these “bomb trucks” with their supersized JDAM load-outs, ready to “deploy or employ” in combat scenarios.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 18, 2020",Australia’s Potentially Game-Changing Loyal Wingman Drone Has Flown For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Known as the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), Boeing Australia’s new loyal wingman drone for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has taken to the sky for the first time. It’s not clear exactly when the flight took place, but it occurred at the high-security RAAF Base Woomera and its surrounding range complex. The flight was originally supposed to occur around the end of 2020, but it was pushed back due to a number of factors. The ATS, which is a modular design capable of having its entire nose section swapped out quickly, is seen as a landmark program for Australia and the RAAF. It is the first clean-sheet aircraft Boeing has brought to fruition outside the U.S. and the first military aircraft Australia has independently produced in over half a century. ATS is meant to work in combination with the RAAF’s fleet of F/A-18F Super Hornets , EA-18G Growlers, and E-7 Wedgetails , as well as F-35s , acting as loyal wingmen by providing additional offensive and defensive capabilities to these existing combat aircraft. Really, that’s an understatement. ATS has the potential to totally revolutionize the RAAF’s air combat tactics playbook. You can read all about this promising program and the ATS’s stated capabilities in this in-depth War Zone feature. A Boeing press release reads, in part: “The Loyal Wingman’s first flight is a major step in this long-term, significant project for the Air Force and Boeing Australia, and we’re thrilled to be a part of the successful test,” said Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, RAAF Head of Air Force Capability. “The Loyal Wingman project is a pathfinder for the integration of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence to create smart human-machine teams. “Through this project we are learning how to integrate these new capabilities to complement and extend air combat and other missions,” she said. Following a series of taxi tests validating ground handling, navigation and control, and pilot interface, the aircraft completed a successful takeoff under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify flight functionality and demonstrate the performance of the Airpower Teaming System design. “Boeing and Australia are pioneering fully integrated combat operations by crewed and uncrewed aircraft,” said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret. “We’re honored to be opening this part of aviation’s future with the Royal Australian Air Force, and we look forward to showing others how they also could benefit from our loyal wingman capabilities.” With support from more than 35 Australian industry teams and leveraging Boeing’s innovative processes, including model-based engineering techniques, such as a digital twin to digitally flight-test missions, the team was able to manufacture the aircraft from design to flight in three years. This first Loyal Wingman aircraft is serving as the foundation for the Boeing Airpower Teaming System being developed for various global defense customers. The aircraft will fly alongside other platforms, using artificial intelligence to team with existing crewed and uncrewed assets to complement mission capabilities. Additional Loyal Wingman aircraft are currently under development, with plans for teaming flights scheduled for later this year. Beyond Australia’s borders, the ATS could become a massive export windfall for the country and Boeing Australia, one that is not dictated by the United States’ strict export controls . Demand for loyal wingman drones, especially those with low-observable (stealthy) characteristics, is set to explode in the coming years as air arms plus-up their air combat fleets. Pairing loyal wingmen with existing tactical jet types is emerging as a potentially promising and economical way to provide some of the capabilities that would only be offered by far more expensive stealth fighters. For those air forces that already have stealth fighters, loyal wingmen could broaden their combat aircraft capacity and drastically enhance the capabilities and overall flexibility of those existing fighters. The U.S. is actively pursuing similar capabilities in the form of its Skyborg program , as well as other parallel initiatives. Boeing Australia’s design could even factor into that program in the near future. As for what comes next, three ATS demonstrators are being fielded that are said to be very close to representative of follow-on production vehicles. Considering how fast this program is moving—it was only announced just two years ago —flight testing will likely ramp up quickly, with all three test vehicles eventually joining up alongside other assets in the air. Much of the basic command logic that will drive the ATS has already been tested on subscale flying demonstrators . There is no doubt about it, what you are looking at in this video is a major part of the future of air combat. We will update this post when more information comes available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 17, 2021",The Navy Plans To Launch Swarms Of Aerial Drones From Unmanned Submarines And Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has handed a contract to Raytheon for versions of its Coyote small unmanned aerial vehicle configured as loitering munitions, also known as “suicide drones.” The service says that it specifically wants them to support the development of unmanned surface and underwater vehicles as platforms to launch drone swarms, which could offer a slate of game-changing capabilities. The Pentagon announced the deal , valued at up to almost $33 million if all the options were to be exercised, in its daily contracting notice on Feb. 26, 2021. The announcement said that the contract, which the Office of Naval Research (ONR) awarded to Raytheon, was for “Coyote Block 3 (CB3) Autonomous Strike” drones to support work on “Autonomous Swarm/Strike – Loitering Munitions.” This is “a rapid capability effort to achieve operational launch capability from unmanned surface vessels (USVs) and an unmanned underwater vessel (UUV). The intended concept of operations (CONOP) and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) are to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and precision strike capability from maritime platforms,” the contracting notice added. “Additionally, the High Volume Long Range Precision Strike (HVLRPS) from USVs and Fires (HVLRPF) from UUVs demonstrations will leverage prior efforts including the Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) and progress on the Mobile Precision Attack Vehicle (MoPAV).” It’s not clear from Raytheon’s website whether the Block 3 Coyote is based on the design of the Block 1 or Block 2 version of that drone. Advanced Ceramic Research first flew the initial Coyote design, which is tube-launched and features two sets of pop-out wings, as well as a pop-up v-tail, in 2007. The design passed between a number of companies before finally ending up in Raytheon’s portfolio. A Block 1 Coyote., Raytheon In 2017, Raytheon announced it was working on a new Block 2 version. In 2018, the U.S. Army announced it was buying these versions of Coyote as counter-drone interceptors. Later that year, it emerged that this variant, while still tube-launched, was a substantially different design with a more missile-like configuration. A Block 2 Coyote., Joseph Trevithick The original variant had been marketed primarily as a small, low-cost intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platform. However, Raytheon has said in the past that both Block 1 and Block 2 Coyotes could be configured as a loitering munition , among other roles . A loitering munition is a type of weapon that occupies a space in between traditional missiles and other kinds of armed drones. Typically, loitering munitions, which Israel pioneered and continues to a be leader in the design and manufacture of, are equipped with some form of man-in-the-loop control system. This allows an operator to “see” what the drone sees, right up until the moment of impact, allowing them to make fine adjustments in the terminal phase of flight. This, in turn, improves the overall accuracy of the weapon, even against moving targets. It also adds an additional margin of safety in that attacks can be aborted almost at the last second should circumstances change, such as the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders in the target area. Many loitering munitions can also be recovered for refurbishment and reuse if they do not engage a threat during their flight. Autonomous swarming technology, including artificial intelligence-driven flight and targeting capabilities, are becoming increasingly popular additions to loitering munitions , as well. This kind of swarm can more rapidly search for and then engage multiple targets, either automatically or with human approval, across a large area. It’s important to note that ONR has already conducted demonstrations involving Block 1 Coyotes operating in swarms as part of its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology program, or LOCUST . https://youtube.com/watch?v=8FukTsKmXOo The Navy’s interest in loitering munitions is hardly surprising, both for its own use or in support of U.S. Marine Corps requirements . Both services, as well as other elements of the U.S. military , are pursuing multiple programs in this same general vein . What is much more notable about this particular contract is the desire to rapidly develop an operational capability to deploy swarms of loitering munitions from both unmanned boats and submarines. There is extremely limited information readily available about the HVLRPS and HVLRPF programs. The Marine Corps’ Program Executive Office-Land Systems’ 2020 Advanced Technology Involvement Plan (ATIP) simply mentions USV-based HVLRPS as an ONR program that it is supporting. There is no mention in that plan of the UUV-based HVLRPF effort. The same section of that document does include two LOCUST-related projects the Marines are working on together with ONR, one to integrate swarming drones with “expeditionary systems” and another regarding the development of a “LOCUST Expeditionary Launch Module.” There are also a pair of ONR-led efforts included that are associated with a “Super Swarm” program, one of which is also described as an INP, or Innovative Naval Prototype, a category of programs that includes various Navy advanced research and development efforts. There is equally limited information about that project, which may actually be a group of related projects. An edition of Future Force , an official ONR magazine, that was published last year said that recent “experimentation efforts” in support of Navy and Marine Corps requirements had included “Close-in Covert Autonomous Disposable Aircraft super swarm experimentation.” “This record-setting effort simultaneously launched 1,000 unmanned aerial vehicles out of a C-130 and demonstrated behaviors critical to future super swarm employment,” this issue of Future Force said, but did not specify what type of drones were used in this test. “Data from the experiment will drive performance and effectiveness models and design trade-studies. Manufacturing data will inform efforts for onshore unmanned aerial system manufacturing.” That sounds similar in some respects to tests of the Perdix micro drone , a project led that the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office led, between 2014 and 2016. One particular test in 2016 saw U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets deploy a total of 100 of these unmanned aircraft in flight from underwing dispensers. It’s also interesting to note that in the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request, the service announced plans to close out a specific portion of the line item for INP Applied Research covering “Unmanned and Autonomous Systems” and shift those resources into three new efforts. One of these was LOCUST, while another was the Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MDUSV). MDUSV is an ONR-led follow-on from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Sea Hunter drone boat, programs you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The descriptions of the plans for both LOCUST and MDUSV in the 2021 Fiscal Year as outlined in the Navy’s budget documents do not mention anything related specifically to loitering munitions, or swarms thereof. The third line of effort the Navy planned to break out of the larger “Unmanned and Autonomous Systems” funding line is called CLAWS, but no definition is given for what that acronym means. However, the plan for work on this program in the 2021 Fiscal Year is described as follows: Continue Applied Research on the development of autonomous payloads for extra-large unmanned undersea vehicles operating in denied and contested areas. Payloads will be both kinetic and non-kinetic. Additional effort will include development of autonomy to increase the operator trust for kinetic payloads in contested areas and the development of autonomy and command & control required for swarm payload from extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle. A page from the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request regarding CLAWS., USN USN In 2019, the Navy selected Boeing’s Orca drone submarine, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece , as the winning design for its Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) program. All of this sounds exactly like work described in the contracting announcement from last week about ONR buying Block 3 Coyotes from Raytheon and the HVLRPF program specifically. An artist’s conception of the Orca XLUUV., Boeing Beyond the work the Navy has already done with LOCUST, it’s worth pointing out that the service has already invested heavily in submarine-launched drone capabilities , especially in relation to its four high-specialized Ohio class guided missile submarines, or SSGNs. These boats, which you can read about in more depth in this past War Zone feature , are multi-purpose platforms with robust intelligence-gathering and command and control capabilities. As for the exact concepts of operation and tactics, techniques, and procedures the Navy is envisioning around the HVLRPS and HVLRPF projects, while we don’t know what they might be exactly, the potentially game-changing capabilities they might offer are clear. Swarms, in general , inherently have the ability to confuse, disorient, and overwhelm opponents, especially enemy air defenses . This, in turn, can make it difficult for a hostile force to prioritize threats and respond effectively, potentially upending their plans and forcing them to divert critical resources away from their main lines of effort. Swarms of loitering munitions could be just as effective in a maritime context as an overland one, too. Even if individual drones might not be able to outright destroy larger warships, they could still be used to target critical systems, such as radars or communications arrays, to produce a mission kill. That could put those vessels out of commission for a significant period of time while necessary repairs are conducted. With all this in mind, it’s not hard to see how drone boats and submarines , lines of effort the Navy is also actively working on , potentially operating in swarms themselves, could be an even more capable combination. For example, UUVs, in particular, could be able to more readily ingress into a denied area without being detected and execute strikes on critical assets an opponent otherwise believes to be effectively off-limits to a hostile force. Even if those strikes fail in their immediate objective, they could easily force the enemy to redirect valuable forces away from the front lines in response. A pair of unmanned surface vessels that the US Navy has been testing in cooperation with the Strategic Capabilities Office as part of the Ghost Fleet Overlord program. , USN “The CLAWS INP effort will develop an autonomous unmanned undersea weapon system capable of providing offensive effects to the Combatant Commanders beyond Phase 0 inside the first island chain ,” the Navy’s 2021 Fiscal Year Budget request said regarding that program. “It will clandestinely extend the reach of large UUVs and increase the mission areas into kinetic effects.” The “first island chain” is a zone of the Pacific defined by the boundary formed by the first line of major archipelagos out from mainland East Asia. It is a region of immense strategic importance, especially to China. It is an area that also includes the hotly disputed South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait , among other bodies of water where the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) can bring extensive anti-access and area denial capabilities to bear. A map showing the first island chain outlined in red., Suid-Afrikaanse via Wikimedia Drone boats loaded with swarms of loitering munitions could be a very capable additional line of defense against enemy swarms of small boats , including unmanned explosive-laden watercraft . Given that the Army is already acquiring Coyotes as a way to knock down small unmanned threats , they could serve as part of a multi-layered defensive shield against hostile drone swarms, too, a very real emerging threat . A swarm might not necessarily have to just be made up of loitering munitions, either. Coyotes, or other small drones, carrying ISR, electronic warfare , or other payloads, could also be networked together, providing different types of functionality to make it easier to find threats and engage them in the most optimal way. It’s worth noting that the Navy has already been hard at work at developing and fielding components of a secretive networked electronic warfare “ecosystem” called the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS. This effort is centered on a ‘system of systems’ approach to electronic warfare that will link together manned and unmanned aircraft, including future drones swarms, as well as ships, and submarines. The main goals of this program, which you read more about in detail in this past War Zone feature , are to create phantom fleets to disrupt opponents’ decision-making cycles and otherwise employ electronic warfare capabilities in a cooperative fashion. Swarms of electronic warfare-enabled and decoy drones are a critical part of this ecosystem. Being able to push them forward into contested territory for launch via unmanned underwater vehicle or drone ship would be a critical piece of this evolving puzzle. With this latest contract to Raytheon, as well as all of these other at least tangentially related programs, the Navy has made clear that it sees its future operations as being full of swarms that expand the capabilities of its surface and underwater fleets, both at sea and over the shore.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 26, 2021",The Air Force Is Having To Reverse Engineer Parts Of Its Own Stealth Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a surprising turn of events, the United States government is calling upon its country’s industry to reverse engineer components for the Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . An official call for this highly unusual kind of assistance was put out today on the U.S. government’s contracting website beta.SAM.gov. Mark Thompson , a national-security analyst at the Project On Government Oversight, brought our attention to the notice , which seeks an engineering effort that will reverse engineer key parts for the B‐2’s Load Heat Exchangers. While it is not exactly clear what part of the aircraft’s many complex and exotic subsystems these heat exchangers relate to, the bomber has no shortage of avionics systems, for example, which could require cooling. B-2 Spirit refueling at sunset. , USAF The notice does provide details of what it expects engineers do to support the upkeep of the silver-bullet stealth bomber fleet: “This engineering effort is to reverse engineer the core of the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers, develop disassembly process to remove defective cores, develop a stacking, vacuum brazing, and welding process to manufacture new heat exchanger cores and to develop a welding process to install the new cores on existing B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers. The requirement includes reverse-engineering the re‐core process for the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers. The B‐2 Load Heat Exchanger (NSN 1660‐01‐350‐8209FW) uses air and Ethylene Glycol Water (EGW) liquid to produce cold air for the cooling system.” “The deliverables will include all technical data related to the heat exchanger disassembly, all technical data related to the cores, all technical data related to the stack up, vacuum brazing, and installation of the cores on existing units. The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed for disassembly, core stack up, core vacuum brazing, post braze processing, core installation. Two (2) government B‐2 Sink Heat Exchangers will be provided as government-furnished property (GFP) to prototype this effort. The two (2) prototype units will be delivered at the completion of the contract to return the GFP. The final design shall meet the testing qualifications specified in the government technical orders (TO). Finally, a qualified source of repair shall be provided that is capable of remanufacturing the B‐2 Load Heat Exchangers per the aforementioned deliverables. The second paragraph makes it abundantly clear that this is a classic reverse engineering effort, in which the technology required to be copied is supplied for analysis before the procedures involved in their original production are replicated. While it’s hard to say exactly why this approach is being taken now, it indicates that the original plans for these components are unavailable or the manufacturing processes and tooling used to produce them no longer exists. This could be the result of them having been so secretive that, at some point, they were inadvertently destroyed altogether. They could also have been simply misplaced, or the parts may have been produced by a smaller contractor that has long since disappeared, taking the bespoke tooling with it. A B-2 sits on jacks at Whiteman Air Force Base, awaiting airmen from the 509th Maintenance Squadron to perform checks., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jessica Snow This should also be seen in the context of the unique requirements of sustaining the B-2 fleet, 19 of which are combat-coded and only 20 exist, in total. In this previous feature , The War Zone looked at how the bombers each undergo a programmed depot maintenance cycle every nine years, including a general overhaul and a complete reapplication of the aircraft’s special radar-absorbing material skin and paint job. It’s a process that already makes use of innovative processes, such as robotic systems to help install parts and apply coatings, to help improve quality control and reduce the frequency of depot visits. Of course, recent developments in technology potentially make the process of reverse engineering much quicker and more reliable, too. Earlier this year, it was reported that the Air Force’s Rapid Sustainment Office (RSO) was looking to industry for a “cutting-edge, automated 3D scanning system,” specifically intended to replicate aircraft parts that are no longer in production, including at maintenance depots. A 574th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron maintainer performs depot maintenance on an F-22 at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The 574th installed the first metallic 3D printed part on an operational F-22 in December 2018., U.S. Air Force/R. Nial Bradshaw In the case of the B-2 scenario, we might imagine how a 3D scanner would be used to scan the original parts and produce a virtual model. From this, at least in part, would then be derived a new set of blueprints that could be reproduced by machine processes and other current manufacturing techniques, yielding a new source of heat exchangers required for ongoing sustainment. One of the B-2’s stablemates in Air Force Global Strike Command, the veteran B-52H Stratofortress , has also benefitted from reverse engineering. In this case, Mission Support Inc. received an Air Force contract to overhaul the aircraft’s engine bypass ducts. With insufficient technical data, the company turned to modern computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology to ensure the new components fitted correctly. Similar initiatives are already underway within the Air Force. The 402nd Electronic Maintenance Group Reverse Engineering Avionics Redesign and Manufacturing team, or REARM, is found at Warner Robins Air Logistic Complex (ALC) at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. Its role is to ensure spare parts supply for older weapons systems. Damon Brown, 402nd Electronic Maintenance Group Reverse Engineering, Avionics Redesign and Manufacturing chief, with a circuit board for a B-52 that is team redesigned, replacing five circuit cards inside the Cold War-era bomber., U.S. Air Force/ Joseph Mather “The first part of reverse engineering is to do an obsolescence study,” Damon Brown, 402nd EMXG REARM chief explained in an Air Force press release . “If we cannot get or find the parts to fix a piece of equipment or replace it, then we go back to the customer or the supply chain with this item and ask them what they want us to do.” Working on behalf of the Air Force Sustainment Center, similar REARM teams are also found at Oklahoma City ALC at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and at Ogden ALC at Hill Air Force Base , Utah. Indeed, as the average age of the Air Force fleet continues to increase, there are only likely to be more such requirements for parts that are long out of production. Before he stood down, the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Will Roper, told Air Force Magazine of his desire for a “digital representation of every part in the Air Force inventory.” The B-2 “Spirit of Pennsylvania” during a programmed depot maintenance stay at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California., Alan Radecki/Northrop Grumman During his tenure, Roper was also keen to increasingly leverage commercial industry practices into this kind of military sustainment, with a view to driving down sustainment costs. “We want to reverse-engineer parts that we may not have the designs for anymore,” Roper said. “We want to look at repeatability of parts so that we’re not critically coupled to an individual printing machine. And we want to look at the entire process of what it takes to get a novelty manufactured part onto a critical mission airplane or satellite.” The Rapid Sustainment Office’s Advanced Manufacturing Olympics last October saw plenty of 3D printing, but also called upon reverse engineering. In one event, teams had to replicate as many parts as possible from a box of components using reverse engineering and modeling. All in all, the search for reverse-engineered components for the B-2 fleet is keeping with the Air Force’s current trend of moving toward the latest digital engineering and manufacturing techniques to help ensure its aircraft can be sustained not just easier and more cheaply, but in some cases, possibly at all. Above all else, it underscores how America’s tiny fleet of aging stealth bombers, which were largely built on highly experimental technology at the time of their fielding, is a uniquely obvious candidate for using reverse engineering to keep it flying. For something as critical as a heat exchanger, which is essential to keeping the jet in the air, these new processes and techniques may have come just in time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 13, 2021",Here’s Everything We Know About Skunk Works’ Secretive ‘Speed Racer’ Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects bureau has officially revealed the design of its secretive Speed Racer air vehicle. The missile-shaped unmanned system is ostensibly intended to serve as an experiment in digital engineering techniques , but has the potential to be the basis for future swarming drones and low-cost cruise missiles . Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s defense editor and friend of The War Zone , was first to report on the new information about Speed Racer. He was also able to confirm that a computer-generated segment in a video Lockheed Martin had released ahead of the Air Force Associations’ 2021 Virtual Aerospace Warfare Symposium, which wrapped up yesterday, did indeed depict this air vehicle. The company similarly acknowledged that a rendering it released last year was also of Speed Racer. The video, seen below, shows that Speed Racer is a relatively small design that is air-launched. After release, the vehicle deploys a pair of pop-out wings, as are seen on many cruise missiles. There is a fairing with grid-style fins at the rear of the system, which looks to be a plug that fits into the engine exhaust to keep the vehicle as aerodynamic as possible prior to launch and during separation from the launch platform, which is also seen falling away. The speed racer segment of the video below begins at around 0:48 in the runtime. Trimble noted that the launch aircraft in the stills from the Speed Racer video appears to be a twin-engine Beechcraft 1900 turboprop, but it’s not clear if this reflects an actual planned future test. It is worth noting that the U.S. Air Force’s 586th Flight Test Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico does have a single C-12J , the U.S. military designation for the Beechcraft 1900, that has two hardpoints under its fuselage for the carriage of various stories and test articles . The 586th Flight Test Squadron’s C-12J with a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) on one of the two hardpoints under its fuselage., USAF Beyond what we can see in the video, information about Speed Racer remains limited. Aviation Week had also been the first to report earlier this month that unspecified tests of this system on the ground were expected to begin very soon and that it would be powered by an engine from Technical Directions Inc. (TDI). Since 2019, TDI has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of drone-maker Kratos . Joe Pokora, a program manager at Skunk Works, had only disclosed the existence of the program at that last iteration of AFA’s main annual conference, which took place in September 2020. He said at that time that Speed Racer was an acronym , but its meaning has yet to be disclosed. “The ultimate capability of the system is really not what the project is focusing on,” Pokora added. “What we are really working to do is show how we use the toolset and how we implement [it], starting from a one-page concept, and [bringing] that all the way through flight.” The toolset that Pokora was referring to is known as StarDrive. Skunk Works is already well-known as a pioneer in rapid prototyping and development concepts and a leader in the use of high-fidelity modeling and other digital techniques to get from paper to a flying prototype as quickly as possible . This is also an area that the U.S. military, and the U.S. Air Force in particular, are becoming increasingly interested in. In September 2020, Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett announced that her service would begin referring to aircraft developed with a heavy emphasis on digital engineering using so-called “eSeries” designations. The first design to receive this categorization was the Boeing-Saab T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer, now also referred to as eT-7A, which the Air Force said “embraced model-based engineering and 3D design tools which reduced assembly hours by 80% and cut software development time in half.” The service has also said that digital engineering is a major focus in its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, a system-of-systems approach to developing new aerial combat capabilities that you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . The Boeing-Saab T-7A Red Hawk jet trainer is the first aircraft to get an “eSeries” designation from the US Air Force, highlighting the heavy use of digital engineering in its development., Boeing From what little Lockheed Martin has shared so far, the main focus of Speed Racer is to validate the StarDrive toolset. “Lockheed built the StarDrive to reduce the time and cost of producing and operating new flight vehicles for the military,” the Aviation Week story from earlier this month had explained. “The image is a conceptual render of an IRAD [Independent Research and Development] funded effort, which demonstrates how we are applying a digital end-to-end framework for design and development of new technology,” Lockheed Martin had also told The War Zone last year after we reached out about artist’s conception of what we now know is Speed Racer. It’s not clear where IRAD funding came from specifically. IRAD is a mechanism through which entities within the Department of Defense can reimburse companies for work that was done independently, but that may be of interest to the U.S. military. An image of what is now known as Speed Racer that was shown at the 2020 AFA symposium, but little detail was given about it at the time. The War Zone subsequently inquired about the interesting design. , Lockheed Martin Still, while we may not have much information so far about the Speed Racer vehicle and how Lockheed Martin has and will continue to use StarDrive in its development, it is very interesting to note that the design has some broad similarities to the X-61A drone . A team led by Dynetics and that also includes Kratos designed that vehicle for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program , which is focused on demonstrating the concept of a low-cost drone swarm made up of unmanned aircraft that can be launched and recovered by a mothership aircraft in flight. Gremlins conducted its most significant test flights late last year, but, despite multiple attempts, a modified C-130 failed to recover any of the drones in flight as planned. Kratos has since disclosed that these flights did succeed in demonstrating “safe operation of the XQ-61A Gremlins in range and in close formation with the Manned C-130 Recovery Vehicle.” That company also said that additional flight testing is planned for this spring and “a new additional phase of demonstrations will focus on Gremlins operational capabilities, including with the Gremlins performing, suppression and destruction of enemy air defense missions and that this demonstration will involve integrating intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors and certain autonomy with the Gremlins drones.” You can read more about those tests, and the Gremlins program as a whole, in this past War Zone piece . The Speed Racer design is even more reminiscent of a test article that Northrop Grumman and Griffon Aerospace developed for the Air Force Research Laboratory’s (AFRL) Gray Wolf program , which began in 2017 and was focused on the development and demonstration of technologies that could go into a future low-cost cruise missile design. Even more interestingly, that air vehicle is also powered by a TDI-J85 small jet engine. A test article that Northrop Grumman and Griffon Aerospace developed for AFRL as part of the Gray Wolf program., USAF Lockheed Martin also got a contract to develop a design as part of Gray Wolf, but, as far as we know, whatever the company design for this program has never been publicly revealed. “I know the AFRL’s Armament Directorate is certainly interested in it, if not even at least partly funding it,” Aviation Week ‘s Trimble also wrote on Twitter in response to a question from another user. As already noted, Lockheed Martin has told The War Zone that Speed Racer is an IRAD-funded project, though it’s not clear where that money is coming from. In January, AFRL also said it had used a digital recreation of an unspecified Gray Wolf prototype design as part of a demonstration relating to another program called weaponONE , or W1. That project is exploring the use of a virtual ecosystem to test munitions and the integration of new and improved capabilities into them, reducing the need for complex and costly real-world testing. The hope is that advanced networking capabilities will eventually allow for experimentation with these digital “weapons” alongside actual, physical systems, too. “The [weaponONE] demonstration highlighted the significant progress made in the past year and highlighted the value of digital engineering to warfighters,” according to AFRL. “In the coming year, W1 will further develop its digital twin prototypes to ‘real’ digital twins that bi-directionally exchange data with their physical counterparts.” All told, it seems very possible that that Speed Racer is related, at least to some degree, to Lockheed Martin’s Gray Wolf design and potentially to weaponONE. Speed Racer may well be a direct follow-on to the work the company was already doing for AFRL under Gray Wolf. In many ways, Speed Racer’s stated goals sound very applicable to Gray Wolf’s core focus of demonstrating technologies that would be necessary for a highly adaptable cruise missile that would be relatively easy to produce and cheap to field. In addition, AFRL notably canceled multiple additional planned phases of the Gray Wolf program in June 2019. At the time, the Air Force said it would shift its focus to the Golden Horde networked swarming munitions effort, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , leveraging existing work that had been done under Gray Wolf in the process. It’s not hard to see how elements of that project could also have been spiraled out into their own programs. Golden Horde is also now getting its own “permanent virtual and live testing environment,” dubbed Colosseum , which sounds very similar in many respects to the weaponONE effort. Modified GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs used during a test as part of the Golden Horde networked swarming munitions program., USAF The development of lower-cost, simpler to produce unmanned air vehicles is a critical component of the development of more and more capable drone swarms and cruise missiles, both of which are intended to be employed en masse. High costs and lengthy production timelines could easily make those projects economically untenable to employ on any significant scale. The Air Force, as well as other branches of the U.S. military , certainly has no lack of interest in new unmanned air vehicles of various shapes and sizes , including drone designs intended to be recoverable, but also “ attritable .” That means that they would be cheap enough for commanders to feel more comfortable in employing them in environments that would be seen as too high-risk for more expensive, technologically sensitive, and/or vulnerable platforms, manned or unmanned. AFRL’s Skyborg effort , under which a multitude of companies are developing a suite of systems that could go into a semi-autonomous “loyal wingman” type drone, or eventually a fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), is the best know of these projects. However, this is only one of a number of related lines of effort within the Air Force alone. With Lockheed Martin now having publicly unveiled Speed Racer’s design, as well as having already admitted that ground testing is set to start in the near future, we may finally begin to get more granular details about this intriguing program and where Skunk Works might be looking to take it down the road.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Navy Destroyer Pulled Into San Diego Flying An Absolutely Gargantuan American Flag (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The trend of American warships flying ever-larger flags—sometimes Old Glory and sometimes flags unique to each ship’s lore and culture —continues to expand. Seeing one of these fighting ships with a huge American flag unfurled while underway is a stirring sight for countrymen and allies, and an intimidating one for enemies. Multiple ships sailing together in formation all flying the American flag, which is also the U.S. Navy’s National Ensign, can be even more impactful. Yet there is one ship in the fleet that has taken this practice to another level, the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Michael Murphy (DDG-112). Case in point, its grand entrance into San Diego Bay on February 24th, 2021. Just before 1:00 PM local time, the DDG-112 proudly paraded its way to the naval base on the southeast end of the bay with an absolutely gargantuan—as in it could not possibly be any bigger—American Flag billowing in the wind off its port side. Twitter user @CJR1321 was able to capture it and shared it with our friends over at @warshipcam , who published it on their Twitter page. During the destroyer’s high-profile transit, it passed very close by an oncoming Independence class Littoral Combat Ship, with its massive flag blotting out a huge part of the passing vessel. In still images and in video it is an awesome and bold display to behold. It must have gotten a lot of smiles for those who saw it in person. @cjr1321 via @Warshipcam The ship’s namesake is inspiring, to say the least. Navy SEAL Michael Murphy was awarded the Medal Of Honor posthumously for his heroism during the doomed Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan, which was made famous by the book and film Lone Survivor . It was the first time anyone from the Navy was awarded the military’s highest honor since the Vietnam War. Michael Murphy during his time as a SEAL., Public Domain The Navy’s Summary of Action detailing Murphy’s selfless heroism reads, in part: Despite the intensity of the firefight and suffering grave gunshot wounds himself, Murphy is credited with risking his own life to save the lives of his teammates. Murphy, intent on making contact with headquarters, but realizing this would be impossible in the extreme terrain where they were fighting, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his own life moved into the open, where he could gain a better position to transmit a call to get help for his men. Moving away from the protective mountain rocks, he knowingly exposed himself to increased enemy gunfire. This deliberate and heroic act deprived him of cover and made him a target for the enemy. While continuing to be fired upon, Murphy made contact with the SOF Quick Reaction Force at Bagram Air Base and requested assistance. He calmly provided his unit’s location and the size of the enemy force while requesting immediate support for his team. At one point he was shot in the back causing him to drop the transmitter. Murphy picked it back up, completed the call and continued firing at the enemy who was closing in. Severely wounded, Lt. Murphy returned to his cover position with his men and continued the battle. So, sailors serving aboard this ship—which has the appropriate motto “Lead the fight!”—have a lot to look up to. As such, they are clearly extremely proud of their vessel and its fighting team, and they are not afraid to show it. Hence the massive ensigns they fly, which include a flag unique to the USS Michael Murphy that celebrates its frogman namesake. Milart.com/USS Michael Murphy Facebook Page Yet it is the American Flag that DDG-112 flies that is as big as it possibly could be. The Pearl Harbor-based ship’s arrival in San Diego wasn’t the first time it has flown the giant flag. For instance, it was hoisted during the 79th anniversary of the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, during a ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial. USS Michael Murphy flying its huge American flag to commemorate the 79 anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. , U.S. Pacific Fleet There are strict rules as to when a ship can fly various ensigns, some of which are highly particular to the ship and include everything from extremely long multi-color streamer -like pennants to the Jolly Roger and more . While the Michael Murphy has its own ‘bone frog’ flag to commemorate its namesake, when making a grand entry into port, it seems its giant American Flag is the go-to choice. As for the size of the ship’s uniquely large national flag and the attention it gets, I don’t think that it is lost on the ship’s proud crew: USS Michael Murphy Facebook page Well done USS Michael Murphy , well done. UPDATE: We have been informed that the USS Michael Murphy flies the giant American Flag when entering port and the giant Bone Frog when leaving port. I think we may get a display of the latter soon!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 10, 2020",Did Russia Try To Refute Criticisms Of Its Missiles By Showing One Blowing Up A Syrian Hospital?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense released a montage of video footage yesterday that it said showed successful strikes in Syria using both the ballistic and ground-launched cruise missile versions of the Iskander system. This was in response to criticism from Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan about the performance of his country’s Iskander-E ballistic missiles during the conflict with Azerbaijan last year. However, one of the clips appears to have inadvertently confirmed an old allegation that short-range ballistic missiles had been used to deliberately target a hospital in Syria in 2016. The footage, different portions of which various Russian state media outlets aired, is simply described as showing “Iskander” use in Syria. It includes clips of launches of the Iskander-K ground-based cruise missile, which is completely different in form and function from the Iskander-E and M short-range ballistic missiles. However, all of these weapons can be fired from the same transporter-erector-launchers. A screengrab from a video montage of Iskander missile strikes in Syria that appears to show the aftermath of one of the weapons hitting a hospital in the Syrian city of Azaz., RIA Novosti capture The particular montage that RIA Novosti put out, seen in the Tweet below, included what looks to be footage of a deliberate strike on a hospital in the Syrian city of Azaz near the Turkish border. The building that is struck has the same H-shaped configuration as the Azaz National Hospital, and there other unique indicators, such as the main building’s position relative to an adjacent road and the specific location of smaller separate structure within the same compound, are clearly visible. These details leave little ambiguity as to what facility is being shown. The video also looks to have been shot via an infrared camera on an aircraft, possibly a Russian drone, observing the target. The sensor system’s crosshair reticle is aimed squarely at the building, leaving no doubt that it is the intended target. All of the video clips are undated and the Russian Ministry of Defense provided no additional context itself. However, there were reports of missile strikes on the Azaz National Hospital, which were said to have killed 14 people and wounded many more, in February 2016. At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defense insinuated that these and other related allegations had been entirely fabricated by individuals in Turkey. The hospital had also been targeted on other occasions between January and February 2016 and some local reports describe some of the attacks as airstrikes. All this makes it hard to say exactly when the strike seen in the footage the Russians released might have taken place. As noted, this footage was only released after Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan’s comments about the Iskander-E in an interview with the country’s 1in.am television channel on Feb. 23, 2021. He was responding to earlier criticism from former President Serzh Sargsyan about how the Russian-made ballistic missiles were employed in a brief war with Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region that broke out in September 2020 and came to an end less than two months later . Pashinyan said that the Iskander-Es had been used, but that they had been ineffective, claiming that the warheads in the majority of the missiles fired failed to explode as intended , if at all. He further suggested that the weapons, which Armenia first fielded in 2016, may have been past their shelf life, but provided no further details to substantiate this or any of his other comments. Pashinyan has been under increasing political pressure, in general, since a Russian-brokered peace deal ended the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan was the clear victor in the conflict and reclaimed significant portions of the disputed border region. The ceasefire agreement also included the establishment of a buffer zone that Russia’s own troops now patrol between the two countries. All of this immediately sparked protests in Armenia that almost toppled the government. The embattled Prime Minister’s interview this week had also prompted a response from the Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces, Onik Gasparyan, on Feb. 25, that signed by 40 other senior officers. Pashinyan warned that the statement, which said that he and his administration “are no longer able to make proper decisions in this fateful moment of crisis for the Armenian people,” could be a prelude to a coup attempt . As questionable as Pashinyan’s claims might be, Russia’s response was equally dubious. The Russian Ministry of Defense issued a statement that it was “bewildered and surprised” by the Armenian Prime Minister’s remarks and its chief spokesperson, Major General Igor Konashenkov, insisted there was “objective and credible” evidence that no Iskander-Es had been employed against Azerbaijan. This is despite the video evidence to the contrary and Armenia’s Chief of the General Staff Gasparyan also saying that the missiles had been used, even though he blamed Pashinyan for delaying their employment . An Armenian transporter-erector-launcher for the Iskander-E short-range ballistic missile., Jonj7490 via Wikimedia In an attempt to ram its points home, Russian authorities now appear to have fumbled in a completely different direction with the highlight reel of strikes in Syria. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense interestingly said that Iskander-Es had been employed in Syria, despite those being intended for export only. This raises interesting questions, since Russia is not known to field the Iskander-E, which has a reduced range to comply with the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), an international arms control pact. It is possible that Russia used the Syrian conflict as an opportunity to demonstrate the Iskander-E in actual combat, perhaps as a way to try to secure new export sales. Before now, it was believed that the 2020 war over Nagorno-Karabakh was been the combat debut of this version of the Iskander, which is only known to be in service with Armenia and Algeria . The Kremlin has certainly used Syria as a testing ground for a variety of different , often advanced weapon systems . The Kremlin may have also sent Iskander-Es to Syria that are now nominally under the control of forces belonging to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, who also has existing stockpiles of Soviet-era short-range ballistic missiles . There is also the potential that reference to Iskander-E is simply in error. Some experts and observers have even called into question whether any of the footage that the Russian Ministry of Defense released even shows anything beyond the use of the Iskander-K cruise missile. Whatever the exact Iskander versions shown in the clips from Syria might be, the montage does add to the already very clear-cut evidence that Russia has carried out a deliberate campaign of airstrikes against hospitals, among other civilian targets, in areas under the control of Syrian rebels since at least 2017. The New York Times published a particularly detailed investigation into this matter, which included snippets from thousands of audio recordings that the newspaper had obtained of Russian pilots in Syria talking about carrying out such operations, in 2019. A separate investigation that the United Nations released the following year directly accused Russia of being responsible for war crimes, the first time the international body had done so, in the course of fighting in the country. However, this new video clip would indicate that the Kremlin had been conducting strikes of this kind earlier than had been previously known and using other assets beyond combat aircraft to carry them out. Russian forces first intervened in Syria’s civil conflict in 2015 and were seen, especially when it came to the influx of combat airpower , as instrumental in preventing the collapse of Assad’s regime. No matter what, the footage that the Kremlin has now released itself is appears to be some of the clearest evidence to date that strikes on hospitals have indeed occurred deliberately.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Nov 5, 2020",F/A-18 Legacy Hornets Have Left The Navy’s Carrier Decks For The Last Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. F/A-18C/D Hornets have ended their almost four-decade tenure aboard the aircraft carriers of the U.S. Navy. The final carrier deployment by the “Legacy Hornet” has officially concluded after the return of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 323, or VMFA-323, the “Death Rattlers,” from its final cruise aboard the supercarrier USS Nimitz . The squadron had been part of Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW-17) embarked aboard the Nimitz during a mammoth 10-month deployment that saw the carrier operate primarily in the Middle East and Pacific regions. Ahead of the flattop’s imminent return to its homeport in Washington State, VMFA-323’s jets flew off the carrier and touched down at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California yesterday. The “Death Rattlers” are based there, assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 11, part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. An F/A-18C from VMFA-323 moments before launching off the flight deck of the USS Nimitz on February 19., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Charles DeParlier The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group had originally departed San Diego on June 8 last year, ultimately completing five dual-carrier operations in the Western Pacific with the Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Groups. It also supported Operations Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan, Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, and Octave Quartz in East Africa . VMFA-323 was the last of the Marine Corps Hornets squadrons committed to the TACAIR Integration agreement with the Navy, which involves the Marines providing carrier-capable squadrons that are integrated within carrier air wings. VMFA-323’s commander for its final cruise was Lieutenant Colonel William J. Mitchell. “It’s my pride and joy,” Mitchell told the San Diego Union-Tribune about the legacy Hornet. “I was the last aircraft off the deck today and my entire maintenance department, all my Marines, were lined up along the foul line and rendering a salute as I got shot down [catapult] 3 one more time. That was one of the more emotional moments. Knowing it’s the end of an era is certainly bittersweet.” Now that the Hornet has bowed out of the TACAIR Integration initiative, its place will be taken by the F-35C, the first of 67 examples of the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter for the Marine Corps having arrived at Miramar in January last year. VMFA-314, the initial Marine F-35C squadron , is scheduled to deploy within a carrier air wing in 2022; eventually, there will be four such Marine F-35C squadrons available It’s fitting that the “Death Rattlers” flew the flag for the final Legacy Hornet carrier deployment as the squadron had also been the first in the Marines to take the F/A-18 aboard a carrier, going to sea on USS Coral Sea in October 1985. That same Mediterranean cruise also culminated in the Hornet’s combat debut, which involved attacks on Libyan patrol boats and the Operation El Dorado Canyon raids on Libya. An F/A-18A from VMFA-323 assigned to the USS Coral Sea keeps a close eye on a Soviet Navy Il-38 May maritime patrol aircraft in 1986., NATIONAL ARCHIVES At that point, VMFA-323 was flying the first iteration of the Hornet, the F/A-18A, which the squadron had begun flying in September 1982, making it one of the very first operators of the type anywhere. In fact, the Marines got their hands on Hornet before the Navy, with VMFA-314 being the very first unit to attain operational status with the type, at MCAS El Toro in California in January 1983. The U.S. Navy followed the Marines’ lead, establishing its first two frontline squadrons with these aircraft later the same year. Before its tenure with the Hornet, the famous legacy of the “Death Rattlers” stretched back to August 1943, when it was established at Cherry Point in North Carolina. Between April 1945 and the surrender of Japanese forces in August, the squadron was credited with shooting down 124 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat without a single loss to an enemy pilot. Equally important was its provision of close air support to Marines on the ground in the final months of the war in the Pacific. Since then, the squadron has flown the F4U Corsair, F9F-2 Panther and F9F-8 Cougar, FJ-4 Fury, F8U-1 and -2 Crusader, F-4B and N Phantom II , and the F/A-18A and C Hornet.

VFA-34 gave up its last F/A-18C in February 2019 and then transitioned to the F/A-18E Super Hornet. You can read about the last days of that squadron’s legacy Hornet operations here . Meanwhile, at least for now, legacy Hornets still remain in the Navy inventory for a variety of second-line roles, including with reserve and aggressor squadrons . While we’ll never again see Legacy Hornets operating from carrier decks, VMFA-323 is also set to continue flying the type from the land. Once Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101 (VMFAT-101) is decommissioned in Fiscal Year 2023, the “Death Rattlers” will take on its training role and will continue preparing the last generations of Marine Hornet pilots to fly the type until it’s finally withdrawn for good, something that is presently scheduled to occur 2030. Before then, however, VMFA-323 will trade its legacy Hornets for the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. According to the latest Marine Corps Aviation Plan, released in 2019, this should happen by 2028, a timeline that squadron boss Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell confirmed yesterday. PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLIC DOMAIN Up until the final retirement of its Legacy Hornets in 2030, the Marines will benefit from additional capabilities that are being added to these venerable jets. Around 84 Hornets have been selected for a series of upgrades that will see them out to 10,000 flight hours while introducing new technology that will enable them to bridge the gap to 2030. You can read all about these wide-ranging improvements in this previous War Zone story . So, while it might not yet be the end for the Legacy Hornet in U.S. service, a significant chapter in naval aviation has now come to an end. But, in the form of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the EA-18G Growler , the DNA of the versatile and powerful F/A-18A-D Hornet will continue aboard Navy carriers for many years to come.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 14, 2019",Doomsday Plane Crews Made This Darkly Humorous Music Video Aptly Set To “Burning Down The House”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You just have to love squadron videos. From the sublime to the ridiculous , it’s always interesting to see how crews celebrate their traditions and showcase the aircraft they operate. While naval fighter units unsurprisingly grab most of the attention, those tasked with operating America’s E-6B Mercury “Doomsday Planes” haven’t shied away from playing in this often bizarre medium. Since the most important job of the E-6B is to relay orders to launch volleys of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles during a nuclear apocalypse, the choice of music — the Talking Heads’ 1983 new-wave classic ‘Burning Down the House’ — is appropriate, especially since it is paired with stock footage of various nuclear tests literally blasting houses with their explosive firestorm. Yes, it is some dark humor, but how else do you deal with a job that can result in ushering in the end of the world as we know it? The video in question was brought to our attention by Brad Howard , a producer at CNBC and himself a former U.S. Air Force enlisted aircrew member. Few details about the video are available, but it was uploaded to YouTube in 2010 and some portions feature the logo of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 4 (VQ-4), the “Shadows,” one of three Navy E-6B squadrons home-based at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, suggesting that crew from this unit may have created it. Responsible for the “Take Charge And Move Out” (TACAMO) mission, providing airborne command and control support for America’s nuclear deterrent forces, each E-6B aircraft is manned by highly skilled crews who would be trusted to transmit Emergency Action Messages to ballistic missile submarines during a major crisis. The wartime TACAMO mission would include relaying orders to carry out a nuclear strike or even remotely initiating the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles from their silos. For this purpose, the aircraft features extensive EMP hardening as well as advanced and highly secure satellite communications and line-of-sight data-links, together with very low frequency (VLF) antennas. These can communicate with submarines down to a depth of around 60 feet, albeit transmitting at very slow data transfer rates. The submarines, in turn, have their own VLF trailing antennas to receive transmissions. The video combines footage of daily E-6B operations from aboard the jet, on the flight line, and in the squadron ready rooms with library footage of Cold War nuclear tests, and ballistic missile launches from both land and sea. There are even cameo appearances by an Air Force B-2 Spirit and a Soviet Tu-95 Bear nuclear bomber . One interesting sequence, from around 1:06 in the video, shows the deployment of the E-6B’s primary VLF antenna, which it uses to communicate with submerged submarines. A little over five miles long, the antenna is stabilized by a drogue on its trailing end. Also shown being deployed is the shorter VLF antenna that is reeled out from its tail. You can read all about this unusual maneuver in this previous War Zone article . An animated sequence reveals how the Mercury pilots put the jet into a very steep and tight banking turn at slow speed to ensure that the antenna as close to vertical as possible, to maximize transmission effectiveness. These turns are typically repeated, often for hours at a time, to send messages. An animated sequence showing the twin VLF antennas deployed from an E-6., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP While the video makes no attempt to hide the E-6B’s planned role in a potential Armageddon, the aircraft has other roles, too. They are also configured to serve as airborne command posts in other contingencies, such as nuclear disasters, and can even provide global weather forecasting. Introduced to service in 1989, the original E-6A Mercury was later upgraded to the current E-6B standard, at the same time taking on the role of providing aerial command and control support for the Air Force’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and nuclear-armed bomber forces. Although the 16-strong E-6B fleet comprises some of the youngest Boeing 707 airliner -derivative airframes, plans are already afoot to eventually replace these aircraft . In a remarkable turn of events, the designated replacement for the E-6B is a modified C-130J-30 Hercules turboprop airlifter; a modern version of the EC-130Q aircraft that the E-6 replaced over 30 years ago. The E-6B is currently expected to remain in use until at least 2038. The E-6’s predecessor, an EC-130Q, in service with VQ-4., U.S. Navy Previously, there had been plans to replace not only the E-6B but also the Boeing 747-based E-4B Nightwatch National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) and the Boeing 757-based C-32A Air Force Two executive transport aircraft with a single platform. This was known as NEAT , an acronym that described the separate NAOC, Executive Airlift, Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), and TACAMO functions, but in the event, the Air Force and Navy chose to go their separate ways. For its part, the Air Force is now focusing on the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) program to replace the E-4Bs. Most recently, the Air Force seemed to commit to another 747-based platform . It may not be the best-publicized naval aviation tasking, but there is no doubt that TACAMO is one of the most vital, as it is fundamental to the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Bearing in mind the grave seriousness of the job, it is perhaps little wonder that the E-6B crews have, in the past, taken the opportunity to inject a little light relief into their essential, but dark mission.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",Biden Strikes Back: What We Know About The Bombing Raid On Iran’s Militias (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military says that it has carried out strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Syria in retaliation for a rocket attack on Erbil Airport in northern Iraq last week. That attack, which the War Zone reported on at the time , killed a contractor working for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria and injured a U.S. military serviceperson, among other casualties. This would appear to be the first American strike on Iranian-supported groups in the region under President Joe Biden. A statement from Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby on Feb. 25, 2021, says that President Biden directly ordered the strikes on multiple facilities at an unspecified border crossing point. Other reports have said that the targets belonged to Iranian-backed groups operating in the strategic Syrian border town of Al Bukamal . The press release also specifically named two Iranian-supported groups, Kait’ib Hezbollah and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, as among those that the strikes were aimed at. Kait’ib Hezbollah is one of the most powerful pro-Iran militias based in Iraq and has been the target of American retaliatory strikes following deadly rocket attacks in the past. A map of the region, with an inset focused on Al Bukamal in Syria., Google Earth The full statement is as follows: At President Biden’s direction, U.S. military forces earlier this evening conducted airstrikes against infrastructure utilized by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria. These strikes were authorized in response to recent attacks against American and Coalition personnel in Iraq, and to ongoing threats to those personnel. Specifically, the strikes destroyed multiple facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed militant groups, including Kait’ib Hezbollah (KH) and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS). This proportionate military response was conducted together with diplomatic measures, including consultation with Coalition partners. The operation sends an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and Coalition personnel. At the same time, we have acted in a deliberate manner that aims to de-escalate the overall situation in both eastern Syria and Iraq. “I’m confident in the target that we went after, we know what we hit,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was flying from California to Washington when news of the strikes broke, told reporters traveling with him. “We’re confident that that target was being used by the same Shia militants that conducted the strikes.” “We said a number of times that we will respond on our timeline,” Austin continued, adding that he had recommended the strikes to President Biden. “We wanted to be sure of the connectivity and we wanted to be sure that we had the right targets.” Jennifer Griffin of Fox News reported that U.S. Air Force “F-15” combat jets had been used to carry out the strikes. These were almost certainly F-15E Strike Eagles based in neighboring Jordan, which have been go-to assets for these kinds of operations in recent years. It’s interesting to note that, per a long-standing deconfliction arrangement , the airspace above Al Bukamal is under the control of Russian forces in Syria supporting Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. There is no indication, though, that these strikes were coordinated in any way with Russia. Online flight tracking software also indicated that a specialized Air Force E-11A Battlefield Airborne Control Node (BACN) aircraft was in the area during the strikes. These aircraft, which you can read about more in detail in this past War Zone feature , have a highly-specialized communications suite that provides a valuable gateway to share information between diverse platforms and personnel, in the air and down below, during operations. A KC-10A Extender aerial refueling tanker was also spotted in the area. In the days leading up to the strike, U.S. special operations reconnaissance aircraft were also tracked prowling around the area. Fox News ‘ Griffin also said that the strikes had been timed deliberately to focus on destroying facilities, such as command and control centers and logistics warehouses, and their contents, rather than causing casualties. An official told her that it was a “shot across the bow” and a “warning” aimed at Iran and its regional proxies. Last year, there were reports that Iranian-backed militias appeared to be expanding their main base of operations in Al Bukamal, a complex named after Imam Ali, a key figure in the foundation of Shia Islam, including with the addition of new underground facilities. This followed earlier U.S. strikes on that base in 2019, as well as others in 2020 that were reportedly carried out by Israel as part of its own campaign against Iranian proxies . Though it’s not clear what the strikes targeted exactly, what we do know about their planning and execution is significant in its own right. By every indication, President Biden and his administration sought to retaliate against the perpetrators of the attacks on Erbil and send a message to Iran, but also do so in such a way as to try to reduce the risk of immediate escalation as much as possible. This is in some contrast to how former President Donald Trump and his administration handled similar incidents in Iraq in the past few years. That the Pentagon has publicly stated that there was coordination with allies and partners regarding these strikes seems to be pointed messaging that is at least partially aimed at underlining differences with the prior administration’s policies and general diplomatic tone. All of this comes as the Biden administration is working to return the U.S. government to full participation in the controversial multi-national deal over Iran’s nuclear program and convince authorities in Tehran to do the same. Biden has also said that Iran will get no sanctions relief until it returns to full compliance with this agreement, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). President Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran Deal in 2018. How the intended messaging from these new strikes on Iranian-backed militias in Syria is received, both by those groups and in Tehran, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the Biden administration now appears willing to continue using military force against these groups when certain circumstances present themselves. UPDATE 2/26/21: Additional details have now emerged about these strikes in Syria, including that U.S. combat aircraft dropped a total of seven 500-pound-class precision-guided bombs, according to Politico . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that American officials contacted their Russian counterparts to alert them about the operation just minutes before the bombs began to fall. There have been conflicting reports about how many Iranian-backed militiamen may have been killed as a result of the operation. The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an independent group monitoring the conflict in that country, said that 22 individuals had died , according to its sources. Iranian media outlets have reported that only one person was killed , but that others were injured. Pictures have also begun to emerge that reportedly show the aftermath of the strikes.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Mirage F1 Aggressor Jet Crash Lands At Tyndall Air Force Base (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports are coming in of an unspecified “incident” involving a Mirage F1 fighter jet operated by the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , or ATAC, at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida . An official statement from the base’s public affairs office confirmed that an incident occurred at around 11:25 AM local time, but offered no additional details. The first indications that something had gone wrong at the Florida airbase were provided on Tyndall’s own Twitter account, which stated that “an aircraft incident occurred on base” and that this was “currently under investigation.” At this stage, there has been no mention of any loss of life or injury, but Military.com has reported that one of ATAC’s Mirages — apparently a two-seat Mirage F1B model — was involved. One of the ATAC Mirage F1Bs., CAULUN BELCHER IMAGES Prior to that, local news reports said that “multiple agencies responded to the base” to assist. According to eyewitnesses, the agencies responded on the flight-line side of the base. Unconfirmed reports claim that the Mirage in question had a landing gear failure and made a belly landing in a field adjacent to the flight line. These also contend that the two crew survived, one ejecting and the other remaining onboard the jet. We must stress that this is the information we have heard from our sources and in open sources, and it could change as the story unfolds. As a commercial contractor supplying the Air Force with aggressor support under its huge “red air” adversary support program, ATAC operates a diverse fleet that includes 61 former French Air Force Mirage F1 supersonic, radar-equipped fighters, the original design of which dates back to the late 1960s. ATAC, which is part of Textron Airborne Solutions, procured the single-seat Mirage F1CR/CT and two-seat F1B jets in anticipation of the Air Force adversary support requirement. The jets began arriving at its new Adversary Center of Excellence (ATAC-ACE), at Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Texas, in June 2017. These aircraft were then returned to airworthy status, with the first refurbished Mirage F1 — a two-seat B model — taking to the air at Alliance Airport on August 22, 2019. An ATAC Mirage F1CR., ATAC Around 45 of the ATAC Mirage F1s are set to be upgraded with new avionics, radars, and electronic warfare systems. These jets will join the company’s supersonic Kfirs and subsonic L-39 Albatros trainers, as well as its Hawker Hunter Mk 58s . In this past story, you can read about why the F1, in particular, is such an attractive aggressor for the kind of higher-end adversary training that is now seeing increasing demand. The Air Force’s Air Combat Command (ACC) awarded seven companies contracts worth up to a combined total of $6.4 billion on October 18, 2019, to provide adversary air support over the next five years. As well as ATAC, the other companies awarded contracts were Air USA , Blue Air Training , Coastal Defense, Draken International , Tactical Air Support (TacAir), and Top Aces. ATAC’s biggest competitor, Draken International, has also bought 22 Mirage F1s , these being former Spanish Air Force examples. For its part, Tyndall Air Force Base is prized for its direct access to approximately 130,000 square miles of training airspace over the Gulf of Mexico. It supports around 20,000 jobs in the communities surrounding the base and generates millions of dollars for the local economy each year. These facts prompted state politicians and Florida’s members of Congress to press to keep the facility open even after it was decimated by Hurricane Michael in 2018. The Air Force is now eyeing plans to field three full squadrons of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters at Tyndall as part of the base’s ongoing modernization. A patch on the flight suit of an ATAC pilot at Tyndall Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Magen M. Reeve The first ATAC Mirages arrived at Tyndall last December 14 . This detachment comprises around six aircraft, five pilots, and 30 maintenance personnel. Over the next few years, the ATAC unit is expected to fly more than 1,100 sorties to provide adversary air support to the 43rd Fighter Squadron, which is the schoolhouse for the F-22 Raptor, and the 58th Fighter Squadron, the schoolhouse for the F-35A. The Mirages are planned to replace Tyndall’s current fleet of T-38 Talon jet trainers in this role. We have reached out to ATAC for comment and we will continue to update this story as more details emerge. UPDATE: 5:45 PM EST Officials at Tyndall Air Force Base have now issued the following statement from Air Force Colonel Gregory Moseley, head of the 325th Fighter Wing, confirming many of the previously reported details: Our thoughts and prayers are with the pilots and their families. At approximately 11:25 a.m. this morning a Mirage F1B aircraft contracted through Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) crashed off the end of the flight line at Tyndall Air Force Base. First responders were dispatched to the scene immediately and both pilots were taken to a hospital in Panama City, Florida, to assess injuries sustained during the crash. Tyndall is working closely with ATAC to ensure a thorough and timely investigation of the incident occurs. Additional details will be provided as they become available UPDATE: 6:10 PM EST It has been pointed out to us that online flight tracking software shows one of ATAC’s F1Bs, with the U.S. civil registration code N601AX, taking off from Tyndall, immediately heading over the water, and then circling for a period of time, before heading back toward the base. This would seem to indicate that the crew were aware of the issue and may have been burning off fuel before attempting a gear-up landing. UPDATE: 11:00 AM EST Following our request for more details, ATAC kindly got in touch with us and provided a statement on the incident: “A two-seat ATAC Mirage F1B supporting military flight training at Tyndall Air Force Base slid off the runway, and one of the pilots ejected. ATAC is still gathering information on the incident and we will work with relevant authorities to determine the cause. We ask for your patience and understanding as we work through all the details. We will provide more information as it becomes available.” The company was also able to confirm that the two pilots were taken to a hospital where they were receiving treatment for non-life-threatening injuries.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 10, 2020",CH-53K King Stallion Beats CH-47 Chinook To Become Israel’s Next Heavy Lift Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has officially chosen the CH-53K King Stallion helicopter from Sikorsky, now a division of Lockheed Martin, as the replacement for its existing CH-53 type, known in that country as Yasur . This makes the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, the first foreign military to commit to buying the CH-53K, which was developed for the U.S. Marine Corps . The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced the selection of the CH-53K on Feb. 25, 2021, with the King Stallion beating out a variant of Boeing’s CH-47 Chinook. It is unclear how many new heavily lift helicopters the Israel Air Force (IAF) expects to receive, but previous reports had indicated that it would get between 20 and 25 of whatever design was selected to replace the 23 remaining CH-53 Yasurs. This acquisition is part of a larger IAF modernization effort that also includes planned purchases of new KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling tankers and additional F-35I Adir stealth fighters. A US Marine Corps CH-53K King Stallion., USN “It [the CH-53K] is essential to the IDF’s ability to carry out a wide range of operational activities,” Israeli Ministry of Defense Benny Gantz said in a statement regarding the selection. “The new helicopter is adapted to the [IAF’s] operational requirements and to the challenges of the changing battlefield.” “All details, including the number of helicopters requested, will be brought to the approval of the Ministerial Committee for Procurement as soon as possible,” Israel’s Defense Ministry told Reuters . The decision was also said to have been based on recommendations that the IDF Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Aviv Kohavi, and the Defense Ministry Director General, Major General Amir Eshel, made to Gantz. Despite delays and difficulties in development, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , the CH-53K is now in production for the Marine Corps. The King Stallion has a notably greater load-carrying capacity than the latest variants of the CH-47, though Boeing has been testing a version of the Chinook with the same powerful T408 engines found on the Sikorsky helicopter. Still, the Chinook has two engines while the King Stallion has three. At the same time, the King Stallion is also significantly more expensive than the Chinook. The Pentagon 2021 Fiscal Year budget request pegged the King Stallion’s unit cost at around $125 million . Though the exact configuration of the Chinook variant that Boeing had offered to Israel is unclear, which was reportedly a hybrid of sorts between the MH-47G flown by the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the Canadian military’s CH-147F , the price of a standard new-build CH-47F version is around $42 million . Lockheed Martin has been touting the fact that the CH-53K can leverage much of the existing infrastructure that the IAF uses to operate and maintain its existing CH-53s as a mitigating factor. The company also says the King Stallion has a similar physical footprint to the Yasurs making it easier to use hangars and other facilities already established for the older helicopters. An Israeli Air Force CH-53 Yasur., IAF “This is a smart aircraft with sensors built-in. Following our commercial helicopter sustainment model, the aircraft can analyze itself,” Dan Schultz, President and CEO of Sikorsky, said last year , referring to the artificial intelligence-driven predictive maintenance capabilities of the King Stallion, which are designed to further help reduce maintenance and logistics costs. “Israel has a stark choice: they can go with an aircraft that competed with the CH-53D already, or they can look into the future with the CH-53K.” Israel has been flying CH-53 helicopters since 1969, when it received its first two examples, after having selected the type over the CH-47. These were roughly equivalent to the twin-engine CH-53D Sea Stallions and were also known by Sikorsky’s internal company designation S-65C-3.  They had a much greater payload capacity than any other helicopter in Israeli service at that time and immediately proved their worth during the War of Attrition with the Palestinians and the country’s Arab neighbors. Yasurs were famously critical to the success of an operation that resulted in the capture of Soviet-made P-12 radar from Egypt, a major intelligence coup. The helicopters have continued to be an important part of Israeli operations since then and are used to perform various specialized missions, including combat search and rescue, special operations forces support, and electronic warfare . They have also received significant upgrades over the years. In the last 25 years or so the remaining fleet has gone through two major upgrade and life extension efforts, bring the helicopters first to a standard known as Yasur 2000 and then to the latest Yasur 2025 configuration. A striking shot of a CH-53 Yasur in flight., IAF “In total, the 2025 upgrade encompasses around 20 new systems, with these also including advanced electronic warfare equipment, satellite communications, an altitude hold and hovering stabilization system, and a laser obstacle ranging and display system,” according to a story from Flight International in 2009. “Sikorsky has also supplied replacement main gearboxes, with the type’s original equipment having been monitored closely for cracks over recent years.” Unfortunately, the helicopters are becoming more difficult to operate and maintain, something that has become increasingly apparent in recent years. In November 2019, a Yasur made an emergency landing after a fire broke out on board. Everyone on the helicopter escaped unscathed, but the CH-53 was destroyed. The incident led to the grounding of the entire fleet. In January 2020, two weeks after that grounding was lifted, another Yasur had to make an emergency landing due to a technical issue. Three months later, yet another one of the helicopters suffered a technical fault that forced it to land. The acquisition now of new CH-53Ks will ensure that the Israelis continue to have access to this kind of valuable heavy-lift helicopter capability for decades to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 7, 2020",Check Out The Mystery Drone Model On The Desk Of This General Atomics Executive,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to unmanned aircraft, there is seemingly no shortage of new and cutting-edge projects and programs . As well as actual drones that are being built or tested , there are reams of studies , works in progress , and more hypothetical concepts in this game-changing arena. That said, once in a while, an artist’s study or model crops up which takes us somewhat by surprise. Case in point, a pair of desktop models in the office of a General Atomics Aeronautical Systems executive that Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and a friend of The War Zone , spotted today. The company later confirmed they show an undisclosed prototype combat drone and a precursor to the Sparrowhawk — a weapon-carrying air-launched drone, itself designed for launch from drones. Trimble took a screenshot of a virtual panel appearance by Michael Atwood, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems’ (GA-ASI) senior director for advanced programs, during the Air Force Association’s Virtual Aerospace Warfare Symposium today. Atwood’s LinkedIn profile describes him as “Responsible for technical oversight of the aircraft design and development. In addition, Mr. Atwood oversees the internal company development of advanced aircraft technologies.” Furthermore, he is “Comfortable and capable dealing with the most complex emerging technologies — including low observables, advanced composite aircraft structures, Electronic Warfare (EW), data-link communication and modern aviation weapons systems.” Another GA-ASI combat drone concept, this time for the Defender , that is designed for air-to-air combat, is capable of mid-air refueling, and has a primary task of defending high-value and largely defenseless assets, like tankers., GA-ASI Atwood had been taking part in a panel with the title Mission Domain Live Engagement — Digital Engineering/Advanced Manufacturing, but what caught Trimble’s interest was what was visible behind Atwood, at what appeared to be his workspace. Alongside an assortment of patches, a Pratt & Whitney mug, and a stack of paperwork were two desktop models of drones, neither of which was immediately identifiable. That immediately raised a whole bunch of interesting questions. Were these models prepared for some ongoing or upcoming drone program that we already know about, or were they something else? Meanwhile, on Twitter, C. Mark Brinkley , a GA-ASI spokesperson, responded, confirming that what we can see on the left of the screenshot is a “prototype model for a UCAV system .” Got me out here hunting Easter Eggs. Here goes: * On the left: Prototype model for a UCAV system * On the right: Early prototype for an innovative and disruptive airborne recovery system. Grows up to become Sparrowhawk. — C. Mark Brinkley (@cmarkbrinkley) February 24, 2021 To some, the design may seem reminiscent of the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie stealthy unmanned combat aircraft, used recently as a potentially ground-breaking data-fusion and relay gateway between U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . While it shares some visual similarities with the Valkyrie, it is also quite different. A Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie flies with a U.S. Air Force F-22A Raptor and F-35A Lightning II., U.S. Air Force The model — which features a prominent recessed air intake on the upper side of the fuselage — could be GA-ASI’s concept for either the Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Platform Sharing (LCAAPS) or for Skyborg. LCAAPS is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) program focused on developing low-cost avionics, electrical systems, and airframes for drones, including different wings, tails, and even engines that could be rapidly refitted depending on the particular mission. Skyborg , for its part, is a wider Air Force Strategy Development Planning Experimentation initiative that aims to demonstrate how combat drones can be used autonomously and collaboratively to defend high-value aircraft such as aerial refueling tankers and E-3 AWACS. Last December, GA-ASI was one of three companies — alongside Boeing and Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems — to receive contract awards to build prototype drones that will carry the Skyborg suite of systems. A Skyborg conceptual design for a low-cost Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV). , Air Force Research Laboratory Trimble himself told The War Zone that he thinks the Valkyrie-looking model on the left could be a GA-ASI concept for LCAAPS or Skyborg, but that it was also possible that those designs were the same: think LCAAPS and Skyborg. As for the comment from GA-ASI’s Brinkley, that, of course, could imply LCAAPS and/or Skyborg. The War Zone’s editor, Tyler Rogoway, thinks it could also be a more advanced concept that is larger in size, such as for a more traditional UCAV. It is quite similar in configuration to Boeing’s Naval UCAV concept that ended up morphing into the MQ-25 Demonstrator . As such, this could be General Atomic’s take on the defunct Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program from which Boeing’s MQ-25 demonstrator emerged. It could also be part of another UCAV effort that remains undisclosed. Turning to the other model, on the right of the image, and partially obscured by Atwood himself, this is in two parts, one atop the other, depicting a pylon with an attached drone. “Early prototype for an innovative and disruptive airborne recovery system. Grows up to become Sparrowhawk,” was Brinkley’s explanation. The GA-ASI Sparrowhawk is a weapon-carrying air-launched drone, which recently began captive carry tests in a demonstrator form, as we reported here . This small drone is intended to be launched and recovered in flight, by another drone, rather than a manned aircraft. The company says that Sparrowhawk was specifically designed to work with other larger unmanned aircraft that it builds, such as the MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle , offering an important stepping stone to all-new capabilities on those existing designs, as well as future ones. Sparrowhawk under the wing of an MQ-9 Reaper drone., GA-ASI Meanwhile, the origins of today’s Sparrowhawk lie in a previous design that GA-ASI had submitted for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Gremlins program , which aims to demonstrate the ability to launch and recovery a low-cost swarm of cruise missile-like drones in mid-air. That at least clarifies what one of the desktop models depicts. We will provide updates if and when we receive confirmation of what the other model actually represents. In the meantime, we are left to reflect on what is, without doubt, one of the most interesting and fast-paced areas of warfare right now.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 24, 2021",American Airlines Confirms Encounter With Unidentified Cylindrical Object Over New Mexico,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than 48 hours after our initial reporting on an outright strange incident involving American Airlines Flight 2292 as it flew at 36,000 feet over the northeastern corner of New Mexico on February 21st, 2021, we have confirmation that the event in question did indeed occur and that it is being investigated by the FBI. The incident involved pilots of the Airbus A320 being buzzed by an unidentified cylindrical-shaped object moving at high-speed, which resulted in them querying the FAA’s Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center. The original recording of the incident went like this: “Do you have any targets up here?  We just had something go right over the top of us – I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing – moving really fast right over the top of us.” The confirmation of the event comes to us from American Airlines. On the day of the incident, we asked the company to confirm it and for any additional information regarding it, including after-action reports, and if the pilots were available to discuss it. The first reply didn’t support the evidence in hand, with a communications representative for the company replying: At this time, we do not have any indication the radio transmission was from the flight crew on board American Airlines Flight 2292 on Feb. 21. We immediately followed up looking for clarification on that statement, especially in regards to if the pilots had been directly asked about this or not, and noting that we had clearly heard the flight number’s identification in a longer version of the clip provided to us by master radio interceptor Steve Douglass who originally recorded it. We also mentioned that we are likely to get more information about the event from the FAA and that we really need clarification so that there weren’t any embarrassing discrepancies. The response was completely different than the company’s first missive, stating: Following a debrief with our Flight Crew and additional information received, we can confirm this radio transmission was from American Airlines Flight 2292 on Feb. 21. For any additional questions on this, we encourage you to reach out to the FBI. Not only did they confirm that the transmission was authentic and that the incident did occur, but it also appears to be under investigation by the FBI. We have been in touch with the FAA and are awaiting a formal response to our detailed query. But in the meantime, as we promised, we have authenticated the recording and we now know for certain that the event did indeed take place. It is one of a number of similar strange encounters as of late that we provided links to in our original report . Hopefully, the FAA will be as forthcoming as they usually are with us on these matters and we can get more information soon. A huge thanks to American Airlines for taking the time to look into this and to get us the best information available. Also, a huge thanks to Steve Douglass for the updated recording heard in the embedded video above and for finding this intriguing transmission in the first place.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 24, 2021",FAA Releases Statement On Airliner’s Encounter With Unidentified Object Over New Mexico,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After nearly three days of waiting, and following American Airlines confirming the incident to The War Zone , we finally have received a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the recent bizarre encounter between American Airlines Flight 2292 and an unidentified fast-moving cylindrical object over New Mexico. The events occurred on the afternoon of February 21, in the remote northeastern corner of the state. The pilots on board the Airbus A320, which was heading from Cincinnati to Phoenix, came on the radio channel with the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center and stated: “Do you have any targets up here?  We just had something go right over the top of us – I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing – moving really fast right over the top of us.” The transmission was originally noticed and recorded by master radio interceptor Steve Douglass . We still do not have a recording of any possible reply from the air traffic controllers because Steve’s multiple scanner setup had another transmission that may have blotted out the response. Regardless, American Airlines told The War Zone that the transmission was indeed authentic and forward any further inquiries to the FBI. This was a clear indication that the incident was under serious investigation outside the purview of the FAA. Now, the FAA has released a short statement, which reads: A pilot reported seeing an object over New Mexico shortly after noon local time on Sunday, Feb. 21, 2021. FAA air traffic controllers did not see any object in the area on their radarscopes. While very little detail is provided in this official message, we know now that this was not a case of mistaken identity with another normal aircraft that was operating in the vicinity of Flight 2292. There had been some speculation, and rightfully so, that what the pilots may have seen was a Learjet 60 that passed at an angle in front of and above Flight 2292 during this portion of its flight. One major issue with this theory was that this occurred about nine minutes before the radio call was supposedly made. In addition, the Learjet was traveling 5,000 feet above the Airbus and passed in front of it at an angle about eight miles in distance. This is not something out of the ordinary that the pilots should have reacted to in such a puzzled fashion. There are other factors, as well, that made this theory unlikely to be true. You can see my Twitter responses to Mick West , who works to solve seemingly otherworldly events with real-world answers, especially in terms of classical UFO encounters, below: All that being said, this could turn out to be a case of misidentification with a number of contributing factors. Absolutely! Hopefully, we will get the whole picture very soon. FAA is key here. Awaiting another update on situation. — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) February 24, 2021 All that being said, this could turn out to be a case of misidentification with a number of contributing factors. Absolutely! Hopefully, we will get the whole picture very soon. FAA is key here. Awaiting another update on situation. — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) February 24, 2021 The bottom line, people are fallible. Even the best witnesses can get it wrong. Many factors including atmospherics can come into play. Equipment can malfunction. Etc. Etc. So absolutely keeping this type of traffic as a very real potential explanation is totally relevant. — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) February 24, 2021 The Learjet’s flightpath in front of AAL 2292 roughly nine minutes before the radio transmission was supposedly made. The distance between the two aircraft was roughly eight miles with a vertical separation of 5,000 feet. , Flightradar24.com The Learjet in question flew from Salt Lake to Boca Raton without any deviations according to online tracking software. Regardless, the FAA would have known about the Learjet and where it was in time and space in relation to American Airlines Airbus when it made the radio call, especially after three days of investigation. So, barring a massive oversight in evaluating the available information, we can toss out the Learjet theory based on the FAA’s official statement. We have executed a full FOIA request on this case with the FAA. At this time, they are declining to hand over any more information, including the basic radio recordings between the AAL 2292 and Albequerque Center. This is more common than not, but in the past, on certain occasions, we have gotten additional information from the FAA without having to go through the FOIA process when it was readily available. We will continue to report on this deepening mystery with new info as soon as we have it.

James Deboer,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",How The World’s First Privately Owned Fleet Of F-16 Aggressor Jets Became A Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On January 28, 2021, an Antonov-124 transport plane was loaded up with four F-16s . The plane’s mission was to transport the jets to a location in America’s Southwest, thousands of miles away, where they would be reassembled so they could go up against U.S. military fighter aircraft in mock air combat. Their arrival in the U.S. is the culmination of a vision that started in 2014 when the aerial adversary company Top Aces signed a sales agreement with the Israel Ministry of Defense for the purchase of 29 of their older F-16A and Bs , those types being known as the “Netz” in that country. Here’s the story of how the first private 4th generation fighter adversary jets to ever arrive in the United States did so, and how Top Ace’s overall vision for them is becoming a reality. Top Aces was founded in 2000 by three former Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18 fighter pilots who saw an opportunity to provide adversary support to the Canadian armed forces. In 2005, the company signed a $94-million contract with the Canadian government for the supply of contracted combat support and adversary training for at least the next 10 years. They have also been the exclusive provider of Adversary and Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training for the German military since 2015. Ex-IAF Netz fighters being offloaded at their new home in Arizona. , Top Aces The company began pursuing a fleet of F-16s over the last several years in order to meet the training requirements of preparing next-generation U.S. fighter pilots flying aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor . The F-16s represent a monumental leap in capability over the Top Aces’ current fleet of Dornier Alpha Jets and Douglas A-4 Skyhawks , the latter of which are over 50 years old. The Israel Netz was chosen because it was the first F-16 fleet readily available and the process regulated by the Department of State for importing such advanced weaponry is long and complicated, among other factors. While contracted adversary support has been around for over two decades, in 2019, the US Air Force tapped seven private companies for a huge $6.4 billion contract opportunity for “Red Air and Close Air Support” training where contracted pilots would train against USAF pilots at several locations throughout the United States. Top Aces received an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract that will allow it to compete with Air USA , Airborne Tactical Advantage Company , Draken International , and Tactical Air Support for adversary air services at 12 U.S. Air Force bases. The contract runs until October 2024 and is estimated to involve between 40,000 to 50,000 flying hours per year. A Draken International A-4 sits on the flightline at Nellis AFB. The Air Force paved a future for its rapidly expanding contractor adversary support initiative at Nellis, with Draken International being the major player there over the better part of a decade. Now more companies are getting an opportunity to provide these services across the Air Force’s tactical aircraft training portfolio. , USAF Leading the effort of getting the F-16s flying in the adversary business is Russ Quinn. Quinn formally transitioned to the role of President of Top Aces Corp. on December 9, 2019. Before that, he served as the Chief Commercial Officer for the company. Quinn is no stranger to the F-16 or the adversary mindset. During his 26 year career in the United States Air Force, Quinn amassed over 3,300 flight hours in the F-16 and held several positions in F-16 squadrons around the globe. His career included a stint as a Solo Pilot for the USAF Aerial Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds , during the 1995 and 1996 air show seasons, as well as squadron commander of the 22nd Fighter Squadron. His final flying assignment was employing the F-16 as an Aggressor pilot as Deputy Commander of the newly founded Adversary Tactics Group at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. It was there that Quinn became intimately familiar with the Aggressor business. In the late 2000s, Colonel Terrence O’Shaughnessy was given the challenge by the Air Force Chief of Staff to start up a robust Aggressor capability at Nellis. The capability would not just be in the aircraft tactics but would also include standing up air defense aggressors which would focus on the surface to air missile threat as well as cyber and space aggressors. All of these squadrons would come together in the group. Quinn stated “we had F-16s in the 64th [Aggressor Squadron] and F-15s in the 65th so we had a great flying setup. It was the rebirth of the Aggressor culture at Nellis where we internalized the Aggressor concept of knowing, teaching, and replicating the threat. That organization still exists today and they are doing some really great work.” 64th Aggressor Squadron Viper refueling from the “Red Air Tanker” high over southern Nevada. , USAF Quinn had the opportunity to fly the F-16 for over two decades, but the experience at Nellis gave him a deep appreciation for what it means to be an aggressor. Quinn said “It takes a very special kind of fighter pilot to be an aggressor. You have to be a giving kind of person to really go out as a professional aggressor and realize that your role is very much a training role. You are giving your expertise and talent to make the air force a better place. I was so impressed by the men and women that embraced the aggressor culture and I’m not just talking about the pilots. The commander of the Air Defense Squadron was probably the smartest electronic warfare guy I ever met. They all wanted to be the best at what they did, so the Air Force could be the best in the world. I hadn’t really experienced that before. I had seen aggressors at Red Flag and saw what they brought in terms of the brief and debrief, but to see everything they did was quite inspiring for me.” You can check out our exclusive in-depth feature that goes behind the scenes of the U.S. Air Force’s aggressor program, including a ton of details on the new era they are about to embark on by clicking here. Alaska’s 18th Aggressor Squadron on the ramp at Nellis AFB to fight and train alongside their 64th Aggressor Squadron counterparts. , USAF After leaving the Air Force, Quinn didn’t take the airline pilot route, but went onto the defense contractor business for a few years. He knew that there was commercial adversary business out there, but had never heard of Top Aces. Quinn told The War Zone “I got a call from Top Aces and they said they were looking for a high time F-16 leader who they thought would be able to take the F-16s they just purchased and build a business in the U.S. and get these planes to work supporting the Air Force and the Navy. They already had the sale agreement with the IMOD [Israeli Ministry of Defense] arranged. It took about six months where I asked a lot of hard questions about the plan, but the opportunity to bring the Aggressor culture into the commercial world was an opportunity I could not pass up. This was not just throwing metal up in the air, but rather as a chance to bring the next level of professionalism to commercial adversaries that hasn’t been seen yet.’’ Top Aces has been in the business for almost 20 years and started its initial work with the Dornier Alpha Jet trainer. While it was very reliable, it lacked a radar. They increased their capability with the A-4 Skyhawk in Germany, where they have an adversary air support detachment, but realized a need for an advanced aggressor to go up against new 5th generation fighter aircraft that were coming into squadrons in greater numbers, such as the F-35. “These legacy platforms are just not hacking it in terms of truly replicating the high-end threat with some of the major players on the world stage. The vision was to bring an advanced capability” said Quinn. Top Aces Alpha Jets loaded with anti-ship cruise missile emitter simulator and electronic warfare pods landing at PDX. , Tyler Rogoway/Editor The F-16s that Top Aces purchased from Israel will receive several significant upgrades before they go up against Air Force pilots in the U.S. “What we have been investing in over the past five years is an open mission system architecture where we take a mission computer and add a Helmet Mounted Cueing System , AESA radar , and Link-16. We call it the Advanced Aggressor Mission System and it can go on different platforms. As we speak, our most senior engineers just completed operational test flights with the system on the A-4 in Canada and it went very, very well. The draft RFP [request for proposals] for Nellis just recently got released and it defines pretty nicely what capabilities they are looking for.” Top Aces declined to disclose what AESA radar will be included in the upgrade at this time. The Helmet Mounted Cueing System technology has come a long way over the last few years and Top Aces has chosen the Scorpion system for the F-16. It’s a more reliable and less expensive option than the JHMCS system and has the ability to simulate the employment of high-off-boresight air-to-air missiles. As the Air Force changes and as the threat changes, having an open mission system gives Top Aces the ability to plug and play new systems and software applications to help optimize training for their customer air forces. Similar initiatives exist with other commercial aggressor providers. F-16A Netz fighters during their long and vaunted career with the IAF. , IAF Speaking about setting up the initial cadre of pilots at Top Aces, Quinn told us “We are not just looking for F-16 pilots. What we are bringing to this industry is a professional aggressor force. We are not looking for just high time F-16 pilots to put into these cockpits but rather high time aggressor pilots. These are men and women who have flown in the 64th, 65th, or 18th [Aggressor Squadrons] and they have really embraced the aggressor culture. We are looking for people with that giving mindset as an aggressor that we believe is absent in the commercial side right now.” “We want to show the Air Force that we can bring that same level of professionalism that they enjoy with the active-duty force. I was very fortunate to be part of the aggressor business at Nellis and got to know a lot of great people. I reached out to several of them like Kevin ‘Shaggy’ Wilson. Shaggy is one of the most respected aggressor leaders that the Air Force ever produced, so I asked him to come join the team. We have a team of quality individuals who have decided to join the company and the reason is what we are trying to build here.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=fRj20z-WX2s The first 10 pilots that have been hired for the F-16 program have a combined 52 years in USAF aggressor squadrons and over 34,000 flight hours. It’s these numbers that Top Aces believes will give it the edge moving forward as the USAF looks for more robust aggressor capabilities as they adjust and refine requirements. Last year’s competition included six initial training units known as FTUs, but as the Nellis adversary air (ADAIR) contracting re-compete process begins, it is probable that so-called “Category C” capabilities will be needed. These capabilities include the ability to replicate near-peer adversaries to better train 5th generation pilots flying the F-35 and F-22 by using a combination of technologies such as an AESA radar, IRST pods , and more updated captive carry air-to-air missiles. Top Aces is not disclosing what captive carry missiles it plans on using with their F-16s at this time. Overall, Top Aces believe this “Cat C” requirement will leave them in a unique position to be readily capable of providing advanced adversaries for the Air Force’s needs thanks to their burgeoning F-16 fleet. Tops Aces’ existing Alpha Jets and A-4s are capable of some adversary support missions, but not for replicating high-end, near-peer threats in a full spectrum manner. , Top Aces Top Aces knows that the U.S. Air Force is looking at commercial adversary support at several places, like Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, but they are also aware that United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) is also looking for support, as well as its forces in the Pacific, so there are many options available for growth. Currently, Air Combat Command’s (ACC) contract called the Combat Air Forces Contract Air Support is the primary contracting vehicle to support the Air Force. The Navy just awarded the fighter jet services contract to ATAC and TacAir, the latter of which includes the contract at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada, but both contracts will re-competed in the coming years. Top Aces’ plan is to get its F-16s certified over the next few months. There are some opportunities over the summer and into the fall where folks have expressed interest in putting these aircraft to work so, they are excited to get flying. Two of Top Aces’ Vipers after arriving at the company’s F-16 Center of Excellence at Mesa Airport in Arizona. , Top Aces The 29 aircraft that Top Aces have purchased—none of which are being set aside for spares—still have a lot of airframe life left and more F-16s will likely become available for purchase as countries upgrade to newer aircraft like the F-35. Quinn said, “The F-16 is a great airplane and it’s the reason that it is the main aggressor aircraft for the U.S. and several other Air forces around the world. It’s small enough to be stealthy when you need it to be and its performance at visual range is fantastic. When you add the Helmet Mounted Cueing System you really are able to simulate a high-end threat. Having the diverse kinematic performance of the F-16 really allows you to replicate a significant variety of threat aircraft once you study and know what that aircraft can do. There really are only a few things that an F-16 can’t replicate. The F-16 is very much the complete package for us when combined with all of the upgrades.” When asked about the high cost of operating a full-up 4th generation fighter like the F-16, Top Aces says it is fully aware of the cost to operate the F-16 and it will be higher than current 3rd generation aggressors that have flooded the market. At the same time, the firm believes the costs are offset by the capability that the F-16 will provide and with what the Air Force will want from contractor aggressors in the future. It is notable that another contractor, ATAC, offered the F-16 up against Tac Air’s F-5s for the adversary contract at Naval Air Station Fallon. The F-16s lost in large part due to being more expensive to operate over the upgraded F-5s, but that was a very different contract and the adversary marketplace is rapidly evolving. As to what the aircraft will look like when they start flying with Top Aces pilots at the controls, they will retain their iconic Israeli Air Force desert schemes made famous by the film Iron Eagle —in fact, some of them may be movie stars—although with some small alterations. Most notably, their tails will get the aggressor treatment seen below. The F-16s will keep their iconic IAF schemes, at least for now, but with an added aggressor and corporate-inspired tail flash., Top Aces Like the other two aircraft that Top Aces operates, the 29 F-16s will be part of an F-16 Center of Excellence which is located at Mesa Airport in Arizona. It is at this location where the aircraft will be home-based and where most of the maintenance will be done. From Mesa Airport, aircraft will be sent out much like detachments, depending on the needs of the contract. Quill said “In a notional example I’ll use Luke AFB [Air Force Base in Arizona] as an example where we see turn patterns of usually a four turn four, which means eight sorties a day. So, with this example, we would park six aircraft at that location and work those airplanes as required with a small maintenance footprint to do the small things needed to keep them flying, but most of the heavy maintenance and phased inspection will be done at the main operating base.” “The key to making contract adversaries work is the supply train network. We need to have parts and a place to store them. There are over 400 vendors in the United States that support the F-16 and so all of that needs to be coordinated. To have an F-16 Center of Excellence where all of that comes together in an efficient way is very important to us. It’s a place where we can get answers and get parts to keep these airplanes running because, in the end, it’s all about getting the customer what they need.” Top Aces Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com James Deboer Contributor Americas Around The Globe News & Features U.S. Homeland"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 6, 2021",Iran’s Latest Indigenous Drone Is A Predator Lookalike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran has unveiled its new Kaman-22 drone, which seems to be modeled on the U.S.-made MQ-1 Predator , with other features from the more advanced MQ-9 Reaper . The development comes over four years after Iran showed an example of what was apparently a captured U.S. military Predator, which Tehran erroneously described as a U.S. Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle. According to official Iranian sources quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news outlet, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has an endurance of more than 24 hours and a range of 1,860 miles, although it is impossible to verify any of this. The same source said the Kaman-22 was now “in the final stages of production.” In contrast to these performance figures, the U.S. Air Force attributes a range of 770 miles to the Predator and 1,150 miles to the larger and more capable Reaper. The Kaman-22 conducts a ground engine run., VIA TWITTER “The Kaman-22 drone is capable of carrying all types of payloads with very long flight duration [and] has the ability to identify, monitor, and collect information and photograph distant targets,” Tasnim quoted Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF), as saying. The first available images of the indigenous drone reveal a pusher propeller powerplant, although it’s not immediately clear what type of engine is used. The Predator uses a four-cylinder piston engine while the Reaper employs a turboprop. While we have no idea what engine powers the Kaman-22, Iran has made Predator-sized drones in the past, with the Shahed-129 , for example, reportedly using an imported Rotax 914 engine, as used in the MQ-1. Like the MQ-1 and MQ-9, the Kaman-22’s straight wing features weapons hardpoints, and upturned tips or quasi-winglets, while the upward V-tail, combined with a ventral fin, seems to be derived from that of the Reaper. The landing gear appear to be of the fixed type, in contrast to the retractable undercarriage on the Predator and Reaper. The aircraft also bears a strong resemblance to the Chinese CH-5 drone , another Reaper lookalike that has been widely exported. In terms of size, and based on the limited images available so far, the Kaman-22 appears to be more closely matched to the smaller Predator, which has a length of 27 feet, a 55-foot wingspan, and an empty weight of 1,130 pounds. An MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicle., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson The weapons mounted below the wings of the Kaman-22 have been provisionally identified as four Sadid guided bombs and two Balaban glide bombs, Meanwhile, there is an apparent electro-optical sensor turret under the nose and an unidentified store — likely a data link pod — mounted on the centerline stores pylon below the fuselage. While the forward fuselage hump includes a satellite communications antenna on the MQ-1 and MQ-9, the Kaman-22 is probably restricted to line-of-sight operations via the underslung data link pod. Other images from the unveiling show an AN/ALQ-101 or -119 electronic warfare pod, or a clone, a laser-guided bomb (LGB), and an apparent targeting pod, displayed alongside the drone. The electronic warfare pod is of the type supplied to Iran by the United States prior to the 1979 revolution, while the LGB has a strong resemblance to the American Paveway family. While it is not clear if these are actually part of a realistic, or feasible, operational payload for the drone, they make an interesting juxtaposition with the indigenous weapons that are shown mounted on the aircraft. The Kaman-22 with an array of weapons and stores. , VIA TWITTER There are indications that the first example of the Kaman-22, at least, is not fully ready for service. While there is no evidence, or claim, that the Kaman-22 has actually flown, at least one photo appears to show it taxying, with the engine running. Although of poor resolution, the first photos of the Kaman-22 reveal several potential shortcomings in the build quality of the drone. These include what appears to be a loose-fitting attachment for the centerline stores pylon, a rusty nose gear leg, and adhesive tape anchoring cables around the main undercarriage legs. That could all point to this particular being a first prototype, a non-flying test vehicle, or even a sophisticated, taxi-capable mock-up. The existence of the new drone was acknowledged earlier this month by Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). He was reported as saying that the Kaman-22 (meaning Arrow-22 in Persian) would be revealed by early March and that it would be able to carry a payload of 660 pounds — the MQ-1B has a payload of 450 pounds. Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency, meanwhile, described the forthcoming UAV as “a giant drone.” At that time, however, it was described as an upgrade of the previous Kaman-12 that entered service last September. However, as can be seen in the image below, the Kaman-22 is a very different drone from its namesake and is clearly inspired by the Predator and Reaper. It wouldn’t be the first time that Iran has reworked, or at least been heavily inspired by U.S. drone designs. Most notably, Iran’s flying wing-type unmanned aircraft are supposedly derived, at least in shape, from a captured U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone . While Iran claims the RQ-170 was allegedly brought down in 2011 by an Iranian electronic warfare unit, which commandeered the aircraft and landed it relatively intact, this has never been substantiated in any way. The origin of the Predator displayed by Iran in 2016 is unclear. Speaking earlier this month, Brigadier General Nasirzadeh stated that IRIAF crews were being trained to operate the Kaman-22 at the Shahid Sattari Aeronautical University in Tehran. He also mentioned “exchange programs” between Iranian students and unnamed Chinese and Pakistani institutions. However, it was not immediately clear if these programs specifically related to UAV programs. Kaman-22 taxi trials. , VIA TWITTER Although it remains to be seen just how practical the Kaman-22 is, or even if it’s a finished product, its appearance is just the latest development in Iran’s rapidly evolving combat drone capabilities. There is a big question, however, around why the IRIAF might require a drone in this class. Both the Predator and Reaper are decades-old designs now and are therefore not the obvious choice for a design concept. Meanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) already operates armed Predator-sized Shahed-129s, based on the Israeli Hermes 450 pattern, which is of broadly similar vintage and capability and is now also well proven in Iranian service. It is unclear exactly why the IRIAF is spending time and limited resources to develop this new drone. While Tehran’s economic sanctions have severely limited its ability to introduce new manned combat aircraft, the country has meanwhile concentrated its resources on unmanned aircraft, as well as missile programs. The unveiling ceremony for the Kaman-22., VIA TWITTER In January this year, the combat drones of Iran’s IRGC were showcased during a series of missile and UAV exercises in the center of the country. These included new drones, and drone-launched weapons tested unmanned combat, surveillance, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare capabilities. Iran’s drones have also been provided to the country’s proxies in the wider region, chiefly Hezbollah and the Houthis. Undoubtedly, Iran has made significant developments on the unmanned front, and Iranian and Iranian-derived drones have been used to notable effect in the Middle East in recent years . The Houthi rebels, in particular, have demonstrated the ability to mount increasingly sophisticated attacks using suicide drones. Most notably, these were used to attack Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019 . via Twitter But the Kaman-22, with its runway-dependent design, is not necessarily the most obvious choice for these kinds of non-state operators. On the other hand, the similar-sized Shahed-129 has been used in Syria, as part of Tehran’s involvement in that country’s long-running civil war. In 2017, U.S. Air Force combat jets shot down two of these drones near the town of At Tanf . It is possible that the Kaman-22 has been developed with this theater in mind. Iran’s military has also, in the past, made various grandiose claims about its capabilities and many of these have ultimately proven to be unfounded . Nevertheless, Iran has still demonstrated many actual operational unmanned aircraft, including Predator-sized types, so it is possible that the new drone will enjoy a successful development path. Even if the Kaman-22 falls short compared to official announcements about its performance, it could still prove a useful weapon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 22, 2021",Stinger SAM-Armed Marines Riding In Rubber Rafts Were Featured In Recent Pacific Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent exercise on and around the Japanese island of Okinawa featured U.S. Marines armed with FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles riding in rubber rafts . This offers a look into how the Marine Corps might incorporate short-range air defense capabilities into their new distributed and expeditionary warfighting plans . These concepts of operation are centered on the idea of being able to rapidly deploy and then reposition from location to location, even in expansive maritime environments where individual outcroppings of land may be very far from each another, such as in the Pacific region. The Hagatna Fury 21 exercise took place earlier this month on Okinawa, as well as Ukibaru, a smaller island nearby. It involved mock airmobile assaults, utilizing CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters, as well as the forces in the Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC), a type of small, inflatable rubber watercraft. Marines from 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, presently assigned to 3rd Marine Division in Japan, part of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), was the main unit taking part in the training. A Marine holding a Stinger missile launcher stands in front of a Combat Rubber Raiding Craft on Ukibaru Island off the coast of Okinawa during Exercise Hagatna Fury 21., USMC “The exercise demonstrated that Marines are capable of seizing, defending, and providing expeditionary sustainment for key maritime terrain in support of the III Marine Expeditionary Force,” according to the Marine Corps . The FIM-92 is a shoulder-fired, heat-seeking, surface-to-air missile, also known as a Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS), that is designed primarily to engage low-flying targets, including fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and drones. In recent years, improved versions of the missile have been developed that offer improved capabilities against smaller unmanned aerial vehicles, which present a very real threat already and will only become more of a challenge to U.S. military operations, as a whole, as time goes on . It’s not clear whether or not the Stinger-armed Marines conducted any training to prepare to actually engage aerials threats from the CRRCs, though one picture, seen at the top of this story, does show an individual in one of the boats aiming their launcher at a CH-53E. However, the backblast from firing an FIM-92 is not insignificant and, at least in training, no other personnel beyond the two-person Stinger team are supposed to stand within 164 feet of the launcher when a missile is loosed. A graphic from a US Army training manual showing the safe distances for personnel and equipment around a Stinger team., US Army So, it’s unclear if it would be safe to fire the weapon from a rubber raft without some limitations put in place. The water around the boat would mitigate the backblast issue, as long as the rear of the launcher isn’t pointed at the boat or its occupants. Marines, as well as U.S. Navy personnel, do routinely fire the weapons from the decks of larger ships. Still, even setting aside any potential safety concerns, one would have to wonder if the CRRC would provide a stable enough platform to effectively employ the weapon, at all. At the same time, these rubber rafts could still provide a valuable way to quickly deploy at least some level of point air defense capability along with even very small Marine units during distributed operations. Even a light vehicle-mounted SHORAD system, such as the Humvee-mounted Avenger , or the vehicle-based counter-drone systems the Marines have been fielding in recent years, which are installed on 4×4 MRZR all-terrain vehicles or 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle trucks , would require heavy-lift helicopters or landing craft to get them from amphibious warfare ships to shore. These Marine Joint Light Tactical Vehicles equipped with Minigun-armed remote weapon stations are among the vehicle-based counter-drone systems the service has fielded in recent years., USMC Using CRRCs as a way to transport Stinger teams could also open up additional options for getting them to or from a beachhead that don’t necessarily involve traditional amphibious warfare ships , which the Marine Corps is looking to reduce their reliance on , in general. This month, before Exercise Hagatna Fury 21 took place, Force Recon Marines from III MEF conducted training involving CRRCs together with the USS Ohio , one of four Ohio class ballistic missile submarines, or SSBNs, to have been converted to guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs. The SSGNs are really highly-specialized multi-mission boats with significant intelligence gathering and command and control capabilities, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . Force Recon Marines use a CRRC to head out to the guided-missile submarine USS Ohio ., USMC Beyond point defense, Stinger teams moving around in CRRCs, which have a very low profile in the water and can be difficult to detect, especially at night, might also present a novel challenge to enemy forces. MANPADS , broadly, have proven to be particularly threatening to aircraft, especially helicopters, when they are taking off and landing. As such, the sudden appearance of Marines with these weapons at multiple locations around a hostile island outpost could very well disrupt aviation operations there, even for a short period of time. With this in mind, it’s interesting to note that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps actively trains to employ MANPADS from small watercraft, though nothing as small as a CRRC, as part of its broader small boat swarm capabilities . The Iranians have also reportedly attempted to engage American drones using this very low-tier maritime air defense arrangement, highlighting a real-world use case. A member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps aims a MANPADS while on a small boat., sayyed shahab-o-din vajedi via Wikimedia It’s also worth pointing out that, even before the Marine Corps announced their radical force structure redesign focused on expeditionary and distributed operations in a maritime environment, the service was already talking about future operations involving swarms of small boats. “That’s part of how you counter the peer threat: ‘I’ll out-asymmetric you,’” now-retired Marine Corps Major General David Coffman, then the Navy’s director for expeditionary warfare, said in 2017 . “The Marine Corps largely got out of what we call itty bitty boats … the commandant wants us to get back in the boat business,” Coffman added at that time. “He’s recognizing he needs to distribute his force and be able to move in smaller discrete elements and different ways.” As it stands now, the Marine Corps’ “itty bitty boat” capabilities primarily consist of craft like the CRRCs and slightly larger rigid-hull inflatable boats, or RHIBs. The Navy has more capable light watercraft, primarily within its Naval Special Warfare Command and Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. However, that service is now moving toward eliminating a significant number of its patrol boats, including all of its still very new Mk VI types , something The War Zone was first to report on . The Navy’s decision regarding its patrol fleets, as The War Zone has already explored in detail , is already curious given the capability gaps it would create. It would seem more so given that exercises like Hagatna Fury 21 only underscore the importance of even smaller watercraft, in general, to future distributed maritime operations and their ability to support novel missions, such as expeditionary air defense. There is certainly the potential now for the Marine Corps to step up and potentially expand its light watercraft capabilities, perhaps even acquiring some of the Mk VIs that the Navy is now looking to get rid of. No matter what, as retired Marine Major General Coffman said was likely to be the case four years ago, the Marine Corps’ existing “itty bitty boats” already look set to be an important part of its future warfighting concepts.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2020",Navy Tests Autonomous Aerial Supply Drone From Its Newest Supercarrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy recently conducted a demonstration in which a relatively small vertical takeoff and landing capable unmanned aircraft with autonomous capabilities delivered equipment to the supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford . The service has been increasingly exploring novel means of resupplying surface warships and submarines that may be better suited to future distributed concepts of operation . On Feb. 21, 2021, a Blue Water Maritime Logistics Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) carried a payload described as “light-weight logistical equipment” from the Mid Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center (MARMC) at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia to the Ford , which is presently in port there. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland, first acquired the Blue Water drone in order to conduct various logistics experiments in October 2020. The unmanned aircraft is presently assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 24, or UX-24, Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR) dedicated unmanned test and evaluation unit. The Blue Water Maritime Logistics Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)., USN “This UAS demonstration leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance our logistical efficiency across the Naval Air Force.” Navy Rear Admiral John Meier, head of Naval Air Force Atlantic, said after the test. “We have come a long way in integrating unmanned systems in Naval Aviation and the lessons learned today will help to accelerate this capability to the fleet.” The Blue Water drone is a version of a hybrid-electric design from Texas-based firm Skyways known simply as the V2.5 . The manufacturer says that this unmanned aircraft features an artificial intelligence-driven flight system, has a maximum range of 500 miles, and can carry payloads weighing up to 30 pounds. It can fly autonomously between designated points. It can either land and release its payload at the desired location or drop it while hovering right above its destination, even if it’s in motion, as could easily be the case with a ship. “The long-range cargo transport, dubbed Blue Water UAS, is designed to operate with Naval Forces that typically operate in heavy winds over open water and require aircraft to land on pitching vessels at sea,” according to the Navy. “The technology demonstrator vehicle can operate in some of these conditions and further development will be required to meet the full Naval requirement.” While the Skyways V2.5’s performance specifications and other capabilities appear impressive, its 30-pound payload capacity is relatively small. However, the Navy says that this is more than enough to potentially make the drone a valuable addition to its at-sea resupply options, even for very large ships, such as supercarriers. “Carrier logistics is a complex and diverse problem set,” Navy Captain Paul Lanzilotta, Ford ’s commanding officer, said. “Sometimes getting a small part delivered to the ship has a big impact on the availability of an embarked system or aircraft. Having UAS like Blue Water may improve our ability to quickly meet specific logistics needs where payload and ship’s location permit.” The Navy has also said in the past that when ships encounter problems as a result of logistics-related issues that leave them partially mission capable or non-mission capable, 90 percent of the time this can be resolved by the delivery of a component weighing 50 pounds or less. Right now, the service says it routinely uses its SH/MH-60 Seahawk helicopters , as well as Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors , to bring these parts out to ships. This can only be an extremely costly process, especially if the total cargo weight is under 50 pounds, which is drastically lower than the maximum payload that these aircraft can carry. A Navy MH-60R Seahawk helicopter prepares to pick up a load of pallets during training., USN It’s also worth noting that the air wings on Navy aircraft carriers presently have no drones of any kind. Something like the Skyways V2.5 would offer them a bottom tier of air transport logistics capability to go along with more traditional Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft. C-2 Greyhound fixed-wing aircraft presently perform the COD mission, but are set to be replaced by new CMV-22B Ospreys . Beyond replacement parts, 30 pounds of payload capacity would be more than enough for a drone to deliver emergency rations or medical supplies. It could also bring various types of information, including orders and intelligence data, on physical media, out to ships, allowing them to avoid having to use electronic communications and data-sharing systems that might expose their position to enemy forces. In addition to experimenting with distributed logistics chains, the Navy has already been exploring possible ways for warships to communicate and share important information while maintaining radio silence in recent years. Skyways also says that its drones can fly at very low level to help avoid detection, in general. An infographic describing various concepts of operation involving Skyways’ drones, including operations to and from warships., Skyways Whatever their payloads might be, a large number of Blue Water drones could also be used together to increase overall cargo-carrying capacity, as long as the individual loads remained small. That would only be one component of a tiered distributed logistics chain and could be a valuable part of a “hub-and-spoke” arrangement, wherein other, more traditional assets would bring large amounts of cargo to forward operating bases for subsequent distribution to elements in a particular area. The final recipients could potentially include ground forces , as well as maritime assets. The Navy already has plans to expand the capabilities of the Blue Water drone, too. “We’re excited to get to work on such innovations as folding wings for better handling and ship storage, a dual propulsion system that runs on both electricity and JP-5 [jet fuel], an internal versus external cargo capacity, and an automatic dependent surveillance broadcast [ADS-B] identification system,” Bill Macchione, the Blue Water project lead, said back in November 2020 . No matter what, the Navy’s vision for conducting distributed operations in the future will demand new and additional options for at-sea resupply and otherwise establishing logistics chains that can support ships, submarines, and other naval assets. This will be especially true when it comes to activities in the broad expanses of the Pacific Ocean or the remote, but increasingly strategic Arctic region , where there is likely to be limited supporting infrastructure. With this in mind, it’s worth noting that the same month that the Navy acquired the Blue Water drone, it also conducted a test involving a quadcopter-type unmanned aircraft bringing a small payload out to the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson . That demonstration was part of a series of experiments that also saw various manned aircraft bring cargo out to that boat. A quadcopter-type drone heads out to the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson during a test in 2020., USN “The Ford Blue Water UAS supply demo is a first step in revolutionizing logistics support to maximize operational availability and lethality for these critical capital assets,” Navy Captain John Bush, the director of Aircraft Material and Engineering at Naval Air Forces Atlantic, said of this recent test. All told, the Navy’s logistical future, at sea and elsewhere, looks set to be increasingly unmanned in nature.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American Airlines Flight 2292, an Airbus A320 flying between Cincinnati and Phoenix on February 21st, 2021, had a bizarre close encounter with what its crew described as a “long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile” moving extremely fast over the top of their aircraft as it cruised along at 36,000 feet and 400 knots. The incident occurred over the remote northeast corner of New Mexico, to the west of the tiny town of Des Moines . Steve Douglass, an experienced radio interceptor and the proprietor of Deep Black Horizon, told The War Zone that he was recording from his arsenal of scanners when he heard the strange transmission. The War Zone has reviewed over an hour of audio that Douglass has provided to us from before and after the strange radio call. We are working to authenticate it from the FAA and get further information and comment from the agency on the event. We have also reached out to American Airlines for any additional details they can provide. Peering through the windscreen of an Airbus A320 cockpit. , Hansueli Krapf/wikicommons From Steve’s blog on the encounter : At approximately 1:19 CST on the Albuquerque Center frequency of 127.850 MHz or 134.750 MHz (recording wasn’t frequency stamped) the pilot reported: “Do you have any targets up here?  We just had something go right over the top of us – I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing – moving really fast right over the top of us.” According to Flight 24 and Flight Aware AAL 2292 was over the northeast corner of New Mexico west of Clayton, New Mexico. No reply was monitored by Albuquerque Center because local (Amarillo) air traffic walked on top of it. AAL 2292 was near flight level 370 (37k) at the time of the report. No significant military aircraft presence was noted on ADS-B logs. The aircraft flew on to land in Phoenix, AZ. Steve has provided the radio clip for download, you can listen to it here. The incident is very similar to one that occurred in the same region almost exactly three years ago, which The War Zone was the first to report on . During that event, a Learjet and an Airbus both had consecutive close encounters with an unidentified object that flew over the top of them while cruising at around 37,000 feet over eastern Arizona. Later, the highly experienced Learjet pilot, which was flying for military contractor Phoenix Air , described to local news outlets just how strange the encounter was . His description is somewhat similar to the one from another odd encounter we reported on that occurred off of Long Island. The description of a missile-like object also fits with some of the documented encounters U.S. Navy fighter pilots had with anomalous objects off the eastern seaboard throughout the last decade. The War Zone published official reports that we obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as a result of our deeper investigation into seemingly unexplained encounters between U.S. Navy fighter crews and strange objects during that same period of time that mentions similar descriptions. As to what the pilots aboard American Airlines Flight 2292 could have actually seen, we really cannot say at this time. Many will point out that New Mexico is home to the sprawling White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) along with a bevy of other military facilities , installations , and restricted areas . Still, the chances that a missile could have ‘gone off the reservation’ during a test or some other standard military explanation seems unlikely. There are procedures in place for this sort of thing and pilots would have been alerted to the safety hazard. In addition, the notion that it could be some sort of clandestine aircraft is also highly improbable, as it would have been operating during the day and without communicating with air traffic control over unrestricted airspace. That being said, we need to point out that the Mount Dora Military Operating Area (MOA) is in that area, but the airline pilots would have been alerted to the airspace being ‘hot’ and to other potential conflicts. In addition, it isn’t a place where a munition like a cruise missile would be let loose. Mt Dora MOA, VFRMap.com The events over Northern California and Oregon in October 2017, another case that The War Zone broke , shows that there is at least some precedent for unknown aircraft operating in highly trafficked airspace, even up into the flight levels where airliners fly. In that case, F-15s were scrambled to investigate after the object was observed for a long period of time by multiple airliners. Years after our initial investigation into that incident, all of our sources say it remains unexplained even at the highest levels. We will let you know what we hear back from the FAA and American Airlines. UPDATE: American Airlines has confirmed the incident. Our new story can be found here.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2020",Laser Defense Pod For The Air Force’s Fighter Jets Is Finally Taking Shape,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is about to receive the first major component for a prototype of a defensive tactical laser weapon designed to be carried externally on its combat jets. Boeing recently finished work on the pod assembly for this directed energy weapon, inside which the laser and beam control systems will eventually be installed. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) announced today that it would take delivery of this pod later this month as part of its Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator program, or SHiELD, which has been ongoing since 2015. Lockheed Martin is under contract to develop the actual solid-state laser, while Northrop Grumman is supplying the beam control system. AFRL hopes to get those components by July, after which all three components will be combined to form the complete system. Members of the SHiELD program and their Boeing contractor team inspect the newly arrived SHiELD pod, which will be equipped with additional assembly pieces later this spring., BOEING “Receiving its first major assembly, the SHiELD pod structure will enable AFRL scientists and engineers to begin integration of the complete system, to include pod, laser, and beam control, and signals an end to the development and production stage of these important subsystems,” the Air Force press release said. Ultimately, an advanced technology demonstration program will test the pod-based laser’s capabilities against surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles, with full systems tests now due to commence in Fiscal Year 2024. While SHiELD is initially concerned with proving the potential for active defense of fighter jets in high-risk environments, there is official hope that the system could also find its way onto larger, slower-moving combat and combat support aircraft , too. However, as the AFRL admits, using a directed-energy laser to down a hostile supersonic missile is by no means easy. In its press release, the organization says the technical challenges involved are “tremendous.” “These are hard problems we are solving,” said Dr. Jeff Heggemeier, SHiELD program manager. “Imagine the disturbances and stresses — wind speeds, turbulence, and quick aircraft maneuvers that a laser system would have to perform under. We had to solve those challenges first — and that took time.” Heggemeier was acknowledging the delays that have beset SHiELD, including the challenges of developing subsystems small and light enough to fit inside a pod that can be carried by a tactical aircraft. The significant breakthroughs that have been required to make a laser that is small enough, but also powerful enough, to be tactically relevant, are something that we have explored in detail in this previous article . Meanwhile, the nature of the technical issues that the program has experienced remain unclear, but The War Zone has, in the past , examined some of the program’s setbacks, the most recent of which pushed back planned tests by two years. This was blamed on the combined result of technical difficulties and slowdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, the service had aimed to have a podded prototype system ready for actual flight tests by 2021 leading toward an actual operational capability by the end of the decade. So far, Boeing flew a pre-prototype pod shape — without its internal subsystems — aboard an Air Force F-15 fighter in 2019. During ground tests, meanwhile, a representative laser, known as the Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS), successfully shot down multiple air-launched missiles over White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico that same year. The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS) has been used as a surrogate for SHiELD testing., U.S. Air Force We don’t yet know the exact power class of the DLWS laser, although Heggemeier previously said it was in the “tens of kilowatts.” Lockheed Martin has already delivered a 60-kilowatt-class laser weapon system to the U.S. Army as part of the development on ground-based, vehicle-mounted laser weapons. “Those critical demonstrations show that our directed energy system is on track to be a game-changer for our warfighters,” said Dr. Kelly Hammett, director of AFRL’s Directed Energy Directorate. “The ability to shoot down missiles in flight, and operate in denied environments, increases the advantage we have over our adversaries.” “We feel confident that after years of development and the testing that has occurred, that SHiELD will do what we’ve said it can,” Heggemeier said. “And that is a big win for our airmen.” Should SHiELD prove its potential, it could lead to a game-changing podded laser defense system for all manner of military aircraft. This would offer numerous advantages over expendable countermeasures such as infrared flares or chaff, or electronic warfare systems , directly targeting an incoming missile and pumping out directed energy from an effectively bottomless magazine. On the other hand, lasers are affected by atmospheric conditions, which could reduce the range and efficacy of the beam. Another disadvantage is the fact a laser can only engage a single target at a time, so there is potential for it to be overwhelmed. Ultimately, it might be expected that a future laser missile defense system would form part of a layered self-protection suite alongside various other advanced countermeasures, expendable jammers , hard-kill interceptors , and towed decoys , for example. An artist’s conception of a future fight jet shooting down a threat with a laser., Lockheed Martin Beyond that, a production version of the SHiELD pod, or similar, could eventually be used in an offensive role, too, complementing short-range missiles and gun armament for fighters during within-visual-range air combat, or even attacking certain types of targets on the ground . Finally, it seems, the SHiELD is now on the way to at least providing a pod that can be used for the technology demonstration. That will be good news for the U.S. military in general, which is meanwhile busy working on sea-based and land-based laser weapons . The promise of a laser-wielding fighter that will be able to swat down enemy missiles perhaps just got a little bit closer. Correction: The original version of this piece incorrectly stated that the SHiELD dated back to 2013. The program began in 2015. It also said that the Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS) was a Lockheed Martin design. General Atomics developed that laser itself, while AFRL provided the rest of the subsystems.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",The First F-15EX Fighter Jet Has Now Flown In Its Air Force Colors,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s latest and greatest Eagle, the new F-15EX , now looks a lot more like the powerful war machine that it’s promised to be. After its maiden flight on February 2, which you can read all about here , the first of these aircraft returned to the air today in St. Louis, Missouri, with a newly applied, F-15C/D -style service color scheme. The markings include the tail codes of Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and its resident 40th Flight Test Squadron , which will be charged with proving out the jet in the months to come. The superb photos of this jet, including the one seen at the top of this story, were supplied to The War Zone by Alex Farwell of Viking Aero Images . They include shots of the F-15EX with its new look conducting a “ Viking takeoff ,” as well as the recovery at the end of this latest test flight mission. Reportedly, this was the aircraft’s first flight in the hands of an Air Force test pilot, rather than one from Boeing. VIKING AERO IMAGES The War Zone was first to unveil the F-15X initiative and describe its implications back in July of 2018 and the Air Force is now getting closer to taking delivery of its first examples. Eglin Air Force Base is scheduled to receive the first two of these new Eagles in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021, which began on January 1 this year. The other six jets from the first batch already on order are expected to be delivered to the Air Force in Fiscal Year 2023, but this could potentially come to pass significantly sooner. The first F-15EX aircraft is serial number 20-0001, which we saw for the first time last summer when the Air Force announced that Boeing had won a contract worth nearly $23 billion to work on the program. That effort is intended to fulfill an urgent requirement for new-build fighters, primarily to replace the Air Force’s aging F-15C/D fleet. As well as orders for the first aircraft, the Air Force has awarded another contract to General Electric for F110-GE-129 engines to power at least some of the initial batch of F-15EXs. Meanwhile, Pratt & Whitney is also expected to submit its F100-PW-229 engine as an alternative under a planned open competition. The issues around the selection of the F-15EX’s engines are something you can read more about in this recent War Zone piece . VIKING AERO IMAGES “The F-15EX is the most affordable and immediate way to refresh the capacity and update the capabilities provided by our aging F-15C/D fleets,” General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, said last summer. “The F-15EX is ready to fight as soon as it comes off the line.” Beyond that, the F-15EX will begin equipping the Air National Guard’s formal F-15C/D training unit, the 173rd Fighter Wing based at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon. The first of the frontline recipients will then be the 123rd Fighter Squadron, the “Redhawks,” of the 142nd Fighter Wing, based in Portland, Oregon. This is scheduled to occur in 2023, under plans that you can read more about here . Beyond that, Massachusetts, Louisiana, and California-based F-15C/D units could all potentially transition to the new airframe as well, but the F-35A remains another option for these units. VIKING AERO IMAGES The Air Force has requested funds for an additional 12 aircraft in the 2021 Fiscal Year and builds toward its aim of purchasing a total of 76 F-15EXs over the five-year Future Years Defense Program. Ultimately, the service hopes to buy at least 144 of the jets to replace its older F-15C/Ds that are rapidly running out of service life. The possibility of replacing the F-15E with the F-15EX has also been touted, at least unofficially, while ongoing assessment into the flying future force mix for tactical fighters could provide yet more opportunities for the Boeing fighter. Outside of the United States, there is also the potential for export sales. Boeing is pitching the jet to India and Israel although, for the time being, the Israeli Air Force has opted for additional F-35Is . In recent weeks, Indonesia has also been suggested as a possible, albeit less likely candidate, for the F-15EX. Whatever happens, the F-15EX is now in the ascendancy and it won’t be long until Air Force pilots are flying the new jet on a regular basis.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 28, 2020",Russia Provides A Glimpse Of Its Orion Drone Executing Combat Trials In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has released a video showing, apparently for the first time, its Orion unmanned aerial vehicle during field trials in Syria, including dropping weapons. The footage seems to have originated from the drone’s combat evaluation that reportedly took place in 2018. The video was shown on Russia’s state-owned Channel One television station yesterday as part of a 12-minute report on the country’s rapidly developing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, including the Orion and the jet-powered Okhotnik . While part of the purported combat sequence shows the Orion carrying four small weapons on underwing pylons, these areas have been deliberately obscured. An Orion drone takes off from Tiyas Air Base in Syria., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP The location of the combat deployment is apparently confirmed by footage of an Orion takeoff at Tiyas Air Base (also sometimes known as T-4) in Homs Governate, central Syria. Some of the base’s non-operational MiG-25 Foxbat jets can be seen in the background. In the past, this base has been used as a major hub for Russian rotary-wing operations, since it is closer to the actual fighting than the main Russian airbase at Khmeimim , suggesting that the Orion was forward deployed there to get as much combat time as possible. Twitter user @obretix has also compared this to more recent imagery of the same base, seemingly confirming that the video was made sometime between December 2017 and early April 2019, which would coincide with the previously reported in-theater trials. At one point in the video, a reporter points to apparent mission markings on an Orion UAV in a desert-style camouflage, noting that this particular aircraft flew 38 sorties in Syria, where the Russian Aerospace Forces have been active in support of the Assad regime since late 2015. These 38 sorties seem to have comprised 20 for reconnaissance (разведывательных, indicated with the letter R in Cyrillic), 17 for strike (ударов, B in Cyrillic), and one for an unidentified assignment (the letter P in Cyrillic). The Orion has a turret under the nose with electro-optical and infrared cameras, plus a laser target designator to deliver guided weapons. It can also be fitted with additional cameras or a surveillance radar, although there is no evidence that the radar was fitted for the Syrian deployment. Syrian mission marks on an Orion drone., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Other footage claimed to have been taken during the Orion missions in Syria includes a sequence in which the drone was said to be locating a “terrorist munitions storage facility,” in cloudy conditions, before releasing a weapon, which reportedly destroyed the target. A night strike sortie is shown too, with video gathered using the drone’s TV and thermal imager. Again, @obretix has geolocated the sites of these apparent drone strikes, including identifying individual buildings in the vicinity of Al-Mukharram, also in central Syria. The Channel One report mentioned that the Orion can carry laser-guided bombs and other precision weapons. These were described as “still classified,” before an Orion was shown taking off with a weapon underneath, intentionally obscured. Next, the drone seemed to fire a weapon, with the following footage showing an explosion on the ground. From what we can tell, the combination of a burst of flame from the rear of the mounting on launching, and the general shape, suggests some kind of tube-launched guided rocket or lightweight missile. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dM9-ckOLUy0 Elsewhere in the video, an Orion also appears to drop an unguided bomb from a centerline station. From what can tell, the weapon may be a 110-pound-class FAB-50-series weapon. While this is the only unobscured weapon shown in the video, the fact the bomb seems to be unguided would suggest it would only be an accurate method of delivery during clear-weather daylight conditions. However, Russia has made heavy use of unguided munition in Syria, often in an indiscriminate fashion, with these type of weapons far outnumbering guided munitions. An Orion drone drops an unguided bomb from a centerline station., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Referring to Orion’s performance in Syria, Sergei Tyugay, deputy head of unmanned aviation within the Russian Aerospace Forces high command, said that it had shown itself to be “not just successful, but survivable.” That claim seems questionable, however, considering that even high-performance manned combat aircraft have proven vulnerable to rebel groups in Syria. Drones in the class of the U.S.-made Predator and Reaper have also been shot down on multiple occasions. The Orion is not the only in-development aircraft to have conducted combat trials in Syria, either. The new-generation Su-57 Felon fighter , for example, also made a high-profile, but extremely brief deployment to the country in 2018, although the details of what exactly was achieved remain sketchy. Last December, it was reported that the Orion — also known by the project name Inokhodets, meaning pacer in Russian — had fired “small-sized guided missiles” for the first time. This suggests that the apparently powered munitions seen in the recent video are a different weapon altogether. As well as these various undisclosed missiles, the drone has reportedly also been tested with unpowered guided glide bombs. The Russian Ministry of Defense’s 2021 calendar, revealed late last year, also includes a heavily retouched image of an Orion carrying 44-pound KAB-20 guided bombs, apparently produced by Kronshtadt, which produces the Orion. The drone in question shares the same desert camouflage as the example with the Syrian mission markings, which were applied on the opposite side of the nose. The armed Orion UAV in the Russian Ministry of Defense calendar for 2021., Russian Ministry of Defense In the Russian television segment, Tyugay also confirmed that deliveries of the Orion to the Russian military are currently underway. It is not clear, however, if the additional modifications required by the Russian Ministry of Defense have been incorporated. In April last year , the first Orion system — including three flight vehicles — was handed over, but Kronshtadt admitted that the ministry “had additional requirements that were not originally included in the technical specification.” The early drones had to be returned to Kronshtadt for additional unspecified modifications. It is possible that at least some of these problems related to the powerplant since some issues were experienced with the original Russian-made engine. In the meantime, a new engine has also been developed and could be fitted in subsequent production batches. Previously, in November 2019, one of the Orion prototypes was lost in a crash at Protasovo, although the reasons for this mishap are unclear. A previous publicity video produced by Kronshtadt showing the export-optimized Orion-E: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wEHXdogxgwM Yesterday’s video seems to provide conclusive evidence that the Orion has seen some degree of combat operations, although we still don’t know what type of munitions were involved, or how accurate they are, or any more details of the wider deployment, including total duration or total sorties flown. Regardless, this combined with the reports from the end of last year of further weapons trials seems to suggest that the Orion is now headed toward maturity and potentially has an expanding range of weapons options to choose from. In the past, The War Zone has looked at the prospects for the Orion on the export market and it remains possible that the weaponization of the drone is directed to meet the requirements of potential foreign customers. At the same time, the Russian experience of the conflict in Syria — as well as the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh last year — could also point the way to fielding new Russian units equipped with larger numbers of the armed combat drones.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021",American Avenger Air Defense Systems Reportedly Spotted On A Highway Linking Iraq And Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pictures have appeared on social media that reportedly show trucks carrying Avenger short-range air defense systems on a highway between the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian border. The Avenger is primarily designed to engage low-flying manned fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, but can also be employed against drones. Two weeks ago, the top U.S. general overseeing operations in the Middle East said that the ever-growing threat posed by small unmanned aircraft was “the most concerning tactical development” since improvised explosive devices became the weapon of choice for militants and terrorists in the region. The pictures first began to circulate on social media on Feb. 21, 2021, but it is unclear when or where exactly they were taken. It’s also not clear, if their reported location is accurate, whether these vehicles were heading to or from the Syrian border. Ramadi is situated at the nexus of two major highways in western Iraq that lead to Syria. A picture reportedly showing Avenger short-range air defense systems, taken through the broken window of a passing vehicle, on a highway between the Iraqi city of Ramadi and the Syrian border., via Twitter It is possible that these air defense systems could be headed toward forward bases that U.S. and other coalition forces operate out of in cooperation with local, predominantly Kurdish groups, in Syria’s northeastern Deir ez-Zor governorate. The convoy could also be moving in the direction of the highly strategic U.S. garrison at At Tanf, situated in Syria further to the south, near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. As of the beginning of this month, there were approximately 900 American troops spread across these various Syrian outposts, according to the Pentagon . A map showing the general disposition of U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in Syria, as well as areas controlled by other key actors, as of 2021., DOD The Avenger, also known as the AN/TWQ-1, is a turreted short-range air defense (SHORAD) system with two launchers, each capable of holding four FIM-92 Stinger heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, as well as a .50 caliber M3P machine gun. The turret is most commonly employed mounted on the back of a Humvee, but can be also be emplaced in fixed positions on the ground and atop structures. An Avenger system fires one of its Stinger missiles during a training exercise., US Army The system has a single operator who targets threats using a combination of an infrared camera, optical sight, and laser range-finder. The Avenger can also be cued using offboard sensors, such as the AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel radar, via a centralized fire direction center. In recent years, the Army has also fielded improved versions of the Stinger missile that are optimized for use against small drones. This has included the addition of a new, more sensitive radar proximity fuze with a conformal antenna that wraps around the warhead assembly. There was an unconfirmed report on social media in January 2020 Avengers had been sent into Syria via Iraq, along with High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), but no pictures had emerged reportedly showing the vehicles in the region at that time. So, there is also the possibility that this reported convoy in Iraq could be bringing a new air defense detachment to relieve or reinforce existing elements in Syria, or represent the relocation of assets out of that country as part of ongoing drawdowns there and in neighboring Iraq. The report of the deployment of Avengers to Syria last year notably came around a month after a story from Newsweek said that U.S. officials were seeing a worrying uptick in drone activity near unspecified U.S. operating locations in the Middle East, potentially linked to Iran or its regional proxies. This was, of course, a period where tensions between Washington and Tehran were especially high. That friction ultimately culminated in the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. military drone strike in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and subsequent unprecedented Iranian ballistic missile strikes on bases hosting American troops in Iraq. In March 2020, it was revealed that U.S. forces in Syria were being subjected to attacks from small drones armed with grenade-like munitions, though it was unclear who was operating them. While Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria are certainly known to have this kind of capability, ISIS terrorists have also carried out these kinds of attacks and had made particularly notable use of this tactic during the fighting in and around the Iraqi city of Mosul between 2016 and 2017 . Small drones can also be used to simply surveil American positions , gathering valuable intelligence could be used to plan other types of attacks. m If Avengers did indeed head into Syria, if there weren’t already examples of these systems deployed there, they would certainly offer American troops there an extra line of defense against small drones. Earlier this month, U.S. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, publicly expressed his view that smaller unmanned aircraft, including hobbyist types modified to carry improvised munitions, present the most significant and growing threat to U.S. forces in the region since terrorists and militants began actively using roadside bombs in Iraq following the American-led invasion of that country in 2003. “The growing threat posed by these systems coupled with our lack of dependable, networked capabilities to counter them is the most concerning tactical development since the rise of the improvised explosive device in Iraq,” McKenzie said at a gathering hosted by the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 8. “They provide adversaries the operational ability to surveil and target U.S. and partner facilities while affording plausible deniability and a disproportionate return on the investment, all in our adversaries’ favor.” “These systems are inexpensive, easy to modify and weaponize, and easy to proliferate,” he added, stating that the kinds of unmanned aircraft he was talking about were ones that anyone could buy from a store like Costco for around $1,000. McKenzie has made similar comments about opponents employing smaller, relatively low-cost drones multiple times in the past, as well. This low barrier to entry has already led to their increasing use among state and non-state actors , including terrorist groups and organized criminal enterprises , and only increased the potential threats they pose, something we at The War Zone regularly highlight . “Right now, the fact of the matter is we’re on the wrong side of that equation,” he said with regards to this threat at another Middle East Institute event in June 2020. The SHORAD systems could also provide an additional and more immediate measure of protection against larger unmanned and manned aircraft, which forces aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, including Iranian-backed militias , have employed against U.S. personnel and their partners in the country in the past. American combat jets in the region, primarily U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles based in Jordan , have otherwise been the go-to assets for responding to aerial and other threats to U.S. interests in Syria in the past six years or so. The Avenger is the only vehicle-based SHORAD system in any sort of widespread use in the U.S. military, at present. American SHORAD capabilities dramatically atrophied after the end of the Cold War, something you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature . Until recently, in the U.S. Army, the remaining Avengers had been almost exclusively assigned to National Guard units, with the U.S. Marine Corps also operating a small number of them. When it comes to other SHORAD capabilities, standard Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) versions of the Stinger are also available, as are a limited number of Centurions. This latter system is a ground-based version of the U.S. Navy’s 20mm Vulcan cannon-armed Phalanx Close-in Weapon System (CIWS), which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story , and is intended primarily to knock down incoming rockets, mortar bombs, and other artillery rounds, but could also be employed against small drones. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dKits_TkqX0 Last year, U.S. personnel in Syria began to receive an advanced targeting system for their M4 carbines , which, among other things, makes it easier to engage small drones. You can read more about the capabilities that the Israeli-made Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 offers in this past War Zone piece . The U.S. Army, in particular, has been trying to fill this glaring capability gap in recent years, including with the activation of a number of active-duty Avenger-equipped units between 2017 and 2019. This includes forward-deployed elements in Germany and South Korea, as well as three more batteries at bases in the United States. As of 2019, one of these is part of the so-called Global Response Force (GRF) at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, a crisis response task force available for rapid deployment anywhere in the world on short notice. The GRF subsequently morphed into the Immediate Response Force (IRF), which was employed for the first time in the aftermath of the Iranian ballistic missile strikes in Iraq in 2020. There are no clearly visible markings on the Avengers in the pictures of the reported convoy in Iraq to help identify what unit or units they might belong to. The U.S. military, as a whole, is in the process of acquiring various new SHORAD and dedicated counter-drone systems , as well, including laser and high-powered microwave directed energy weapons. In December 2020, the U.S. Air Force disclosed that it had deployed one such system, an example of its Tactical High Power Microwave Operational Responder, or THOR, to an undisclosed location in Africa for a field trial. In addition, the Army just recently completed a round of tests with a new air defense system mounted on a modified 8×8 Stryker wheeled armored vehicle and is now close to fielding the first examples of that design. Known as the Initial Maneuver Short Range Air Defense ( IM-SHORAD ), this system features a turret armed with both Stinger and millimeter-wave radar-guided AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, as well as a 30mm automatic cannon. One of the US Army’s new Stryker-based IM-SHORAD systems., US Army The service has also received two batteries worth of the Israeli Iron Dome system , which is primarily designed to engage the same kinds of threats as Centurion. The manufacturer, Rafael, says improvements to Iron Dome over the years have expanded its more general short-range air defense capabilities, including against cruise missiles , too. All told, regardless of whether or not the U.S. military has deployed a contingent of Avengers to Syria or not, the threat of small drones armed with improvised munitions, in Syria and beyond, is real. As such, together with the dangers posed by more traditional aerial threats, Avengers, as well as other SHORAD systems, look set to simply become an increasingly routine component of American military activities around the world, inside and outside of actual war zones.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. United Airlines Flight 328, a Boeing 777 with 231 passengers on board that had taken off from Denver on its way to Honolulu, had a catastrophic engine failure shortly after its 12:49 p.m. departure. The view out of the right side of the cabin was clearly terrifying as the engine had blown its cowling off and flames were creeping along the rear of the badly damaged nacelle. The engine’s eruption sent parts falling thousands of feet into neighborhoods and fields below. The stricken 777’s aircrew quickly and relatively calmly called in a mayday and got cleared to head directly back to Denver for an emergency landing. You can hear that radio call below: Witnesses on the ground say they heard a boom and saw a shower of debris falling away from the wide-body airliner. Thankfully, the aircraft, a 777-200 that was delivered in 1995—one of the oldest 777s flying today—with the registration N772UA, safely landed at Denver International Airport about 40 mins after it took off. As it sits now there are no injuries reported on the aircraft or on the ground. “Aviate, Navigate, and Communicate,” in that order. Well done by all those involved. We will update this post with more information as it comes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s Tactical Support Wing is a reserve element, but collectively its five squadrons have among the highest concentration of experienced aircrews in the service. Of the five units, four are primarily tasked with adversary support, flying F-5N/Fs and F/A-18A-D Legacy Hornets (for now), while one is the Navy’s sole reserve EA-18G Growler squadron. While they are tied together in terms of command, they are dispersed across the entire country, from Washington State to Nevada to Louisiana to Virginia to Key West. That’s why the images in this post are so rare, seeing aircraft examples from each squadron all in one place, and over gorgeous Key West, is truly a treat! While Fighter Squadron Composite 13 (VFC-13) and VFC-111 will continue to fly the F-5 for the foreseeable future, VFC-12 is transitioning to the Super Hornet, a process you can read all about in these exclusive features of ours . There is also talk that New Orleans-based Strike Fighter Squadron 204 (VFA-204) may be trading in their Legacy Hornets for something else, possibly even F-16s. On the other hand, the Growlers belonging to Electronic Attack Squadron 209 (VAQ-209), the Star Warriors, are very new. However, this unit also went through a huge change in the last decade, relinquishing their EA-6B Prowlers for the EA-18Gs and moving across the country from their prior home at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington, D.C., to Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island in Washington State .

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 11, 2021",The Polish Military Is Now Officially Armed With The Warmate Suicide Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Polish Armed Forces have now officially fielded WB Electronics’ Warmate, a loitering munition, also commonly called a “ suicide drone ,” which the company has been actively marketing, including with a glitzy sales video, in recent years. This category of weapons occupies a space between unmanned aircraft and more traditional missiles. Different types have been steadily proving themselves in conflicts around the world, including seeing particularly notable use by Azerbaijani forces during a brief war between that country and Armenia last year. In a statement to Defence24.pl earlier this week, Colonel Marek Pietrzak, a spokesperson for Poland’s Territorial Defense Forces, confirmed that the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Rajmund Andrzejczak, had approved the use of Warmate operationally on Jan. 13, 2021. Polish firm WB Electronics first received a contract to deliver 1,000 of these loitering munitions to the Polish military in 2017 and the country’s armed services received the first batch for testing and evaluation the following year. A Warmate loitering munition on display., Polish Ministry of Defense “Precision-guided loitering munitions make it possible to provide PGM’s at low levels – for infantry squads or platoons – that remain capable of acting against light armored targets or even APCs [armored personnel carriers] at vast distances,” Adam Bartosiewicz, the Vice President of WB Electronics, said in 2018 . “Thus they provide a higher level of safety for our operators.” Warmate is a small, vaguely plane-shaped unmanned system with a centrally-mounted wing and a v-tail, which weighs, at most, just under 12 pounds. The drone has a top speed of just over 90 miles per hour and can remain aloft for around 70 minutes, on average. An operator on the ground, using a control system similar to a small laptop, can then direct it to fly to desired locations autonomously or control it manually. A line-of-sight link with a maximum range of just over nine miles connects the user to the drone. The loitering munition’s nose is a combination video camera system, with both visual and infrared options, and warhead. Warmate can be configured with high-explosive, armor-piercing, or thermobaric warheads . This allows it to tackle way array of targets, ranging from personnel in the open to light armored vehicles to small fortifications. This kind of man-in-the-loop control system is a key feature of many loitering munitions, which were pioneered by companies in Israel, something you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . This configuration allows the operator to make fine adjustments in the terminal phase of flight, right up until the moment of impact, improving accuracy, even against moving targets. It also allows for strikes to be aborted, even right at the last minute, if the circumstances change, such as with the sudden appearance of innocent bystanders nearby. Altogether, this offers the user immense flexibility over a traditional missile in a package that is still significantly smaller and lower cost than a more traditional and larger armed drone. The entire Warmate system can be carried by teams of just two people and WB Electronics says a single individual can get everything set up in just 10 minutes. Loitering munitions also offer the benefit of being able to be recovered and reused if they finish their flight without striking a target. WB Electronics has been working to expand the capabilities and utility of Warmate in recent years, including offering the weapon for vehicle-mounted applications. In 2019, German firm Rheinmetall unveiled plans for a version of its Mission Master unmanned ground vehicle with a six-tube launcher for modified Warmates with pop-out wings and tails, rather than ones that have to be installed by a user on the ground before launch. This variant of Warmate is also available for use with a ground-based launch tube that is man-portable. An artist’s conception of a Rheinmetall Mission Master unmanned ground vehicle armed with a six-tube launcher for Warmate loitering munitions., Rheinmetall The Polish company offers a system called Swarm , which, despite its name, does not offer true autonomous swarming capabilities, at least not yet. Instead, it provides a direct link between the company’s FlyEye unarmed small surveillance drone and Warmate. With Swarm, FlyEye can be used to find targets and then immediately cue to the Warmate to attack them. The Polish armed forces have also been receiving FlyEyes in recent years. FlyEye drones., Polish Ministry of Defense For Poland, the introduction of the Warmate is well in line with other efforts its ground forces are pursuing to bolster their precision strike capabilities, especially when it comes to engaging enemy armored forces . This push has been driven in no small part by the potential threat of a conflict with the Russian military, which would almost certainly involve Polish forces squaring off against hostile tanks and other armored vehicles . Russian firms are also developing loitering munitions, as well, and that country’s government says that it has tested some of them in Syria. Poland’s Territorial Defense Forces look to be the ones fielding Warmate first and this would give these reserve units, which are made up of a combination of full-time professional soldiers and part-time volunteers, a valuable weapon to employ against a more robust enemy force. The suicide drone’s surveillance capabilities would also give territorial defense elements an additional means of scouting around and otherwise gaining better situational awareness of the battlefield around them. WB Electronics has already exported Warmate to at least two other countries, as well, one being an unspecified member of NATO and the other an unknown country in the Middle East. There is unconfirmed speculation that the former may be Turkey, while the latter could be the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE-based company Tawazun did work together with WB Electronics to develop the larger Warmate 2 loitering munition. A Warmate 2 loitering munition on a light armored vehicle-based launch system., WB Electronics A Warmate was recovered in Libya last year , though it’s unclear who it belonged to. Turkey is presently the largest supporter of the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), which locked in a civil conflict with a group known as the Libyan National Army (LNA). The LNA has received support from the UAE, as well as Russia and others. As already noted, loitering munitions, such as Warmate, are seeing increasing use worldwide, with Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) notably announcing three separate deals to unspecified countries for various suicide drones that it makes just this month. IAI is the company most responsible for popularizing the loitering munition concept. Its Harop design, which you can read about more in detail in this War Zone piece , was a particular standout in the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia last year. Last week, Israeli authorities also revealed they had been investigating a group of individuals for allegedly illegally building and selling loitering munitions to an unknown Asian country. With this latest formal endorsement from the Polish armed forces, Warmate’s future, including the prospect for additional sales to Poland’s military or to foreign countries, would seem to be bright.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Airbus C295 Transport Testbed Emerges Loaded With Turkish Guided Bombs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An Airbus C295 aircraft has been seen carrying no fewer than four Turkish-made precision-guided bombs, a highly unusual load for a tactical military transport of this kind. The European company appears to be stepping up work on its armed C295 version, with these latest trials suggesting that there is serious interest from potential customers, if not already firm orders. The images in question, taken today by Spanish photographer Santi Blánquez, show an Airbus-owned test aircraft, with the temporary military registration EC-296, carrying four 500-pound-series bombs fitted with the Turkish Roketsan Teber guidance kit that adds laser and INS/GPS guidance modes and essentially turns the airlifter into a strike aircraft. The aircraft was on a test sortie from the Airbus facility in Seville, Spain. The armed C295 testbed on approach to Seville, Spain., Santi Blánquez Airbus debuted its armed version of the C295 twin-turboprop at the Dubai Airshow in November 2017, pitching it as a strike version of its popular transport, over 180 of which have been delivered to air arms around the world. The armed C295 — also offered for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions — was reportedly developed by Airbus in response to interest from potential customers in the Middle East and North Africa. In particular, Airbus officials noted that while propeller-driven light attack aircraft were becoming increasingly popular in the region, come customers considered that these lacked endurance as well as ISR sensors. The variant is based around the company’s own Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS), a mission system that integrates different sensors and weapons and has been installed in dozens of aircraft already. There are two basic versions of the armed C295 offered. The first features a lighter weapons fit, while the second is more heavily weaponized. Both incorporate electro-optical sensors in a turret below the nose, and a surveillance radar below the fuselage, which can be seen in the aircraft under test. Other equipment includes communications and self-protection suites. An armed C295 demonstrator at the Dubai Airshow in November 2017., Mztourist/Wikimedia Commons The light version uses a roll-on/roll-off FITS and has a pair of manually aimed .50-caliber machine guns firing from the fuselage doors. Since both FITS and machine guns can be removed fairly rapidly, the aircraft can also be used for basic transport missions. The machine gun has already been tested and declared ready for delivery. The “heavy” version uses a fixed FITS installation and has four underwing hardpoints — as seen on EC-296. When the aircraft was unveiled, Airbus had already teamed up with Roketsan, with the Turkish firm to provide the guided weapons. As well as the 500-pound-class Teber guided bombs seen above, options include up to 16 L-UMTAS lightweight laser-guided air-to-ground missiles or pods for 2.75-inch Cirit laser-guided rockets. Another option is the Spanish-made Expal CAT-70 unguided rocket, carried in pods provided by the Brazilian company Equipaer. Meanwhile, adding precision-guided munitions to a transport-derived gunship is something that is happening increasingly in the United States too, in both the Air Force and Marine Corps . The L-UMTAS lightweight laser-guided air-to-ground missile was developed primarily for attack helicopters., Roketsan To turn the C295 into a genuine mini-gunship, a 27mm Mauser BK27 automatic cannon — as used in the Eurofighter Typhoon , among others — can be added in the port side of the fuselage, combined with a second electro-optical turret mounted on the fuselage side for target acquisition and aiming. This weapon is said to have an effective range of 2.5 miles. Intriguingly, the photographer suggests that the paratroop door on the port side of the fuselage of EC-296 seems to have a hatch for an automatic gun. The use of non-American armament was a deliberate decision, avoiding the possible restrictions imposed by the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) guidelines, which can limit the transfer of defense and military technologies and services. The Teber precision guidance kit for use on Mk 81 and Mk 82 general-purpose bombs., Roketsan “We heard from [potential] customers that they want some of these weapons and were interested in working with two of the providers, which makes it easier for us,” Miguel Morales, head of airborne ISR marketing at Airbus told AirForces Monthly magazine back in 2017. At the same time, Morales also said that the .50-caliber gun installation was soon to be delivered to an undisclosed customer in the Middle East. There is no confirmation whether or not that has happened, although the Security & Defense Arabia website suggested in 2017 that examples had already been delivered to an unidentified customer, armed with two .50-caliber guns and mounts, supplied by Nobles Worldwide and U.S. Ordnance. In the past, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been suggested as a potential customer for the armed C295 and a $250-million contract for five C295s was announced at the 2017 Dubai Airshow. So far, there has been no evidence these aircraft were provided in an armed configuration, but at least one has been seen with a sensor turret under the nose and it is noteworthy that the UAE is already a customer of both the L-UMTAS missile and the Cirit laser-guided rocket. These have been integrated on the country’s IOMAX Archangel and AT-802U light attack aircraft, which you can read about here . A United Arab Emirates Air Force C295. , Anna Zvereva/Wikimedia Commons There was also a separate C295 gunship project, pursued by the then Orbital ATK and Jordan’s King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB). In contrast to the Airbus offering, this would have used U.S.-supplied AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and the BAE Systems Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser-guided rockets. However, interest seemed to fade, after which the Royal Jordanian Air Force offered its previous AC235 gunships and its C295 transports for sale . Having Airbus as the systems integrator would seem to provide potential customers with an additional degree of confidence in that the original equipment manufacturer is able to certify the complete package of aircraft and subsystems. In late 2017, Airbus said it expected flight tests to begin in October the following year. The company also said that the program has been slowed down by the need to wait for the test aircraft to become available. The same airframe was previously used to prove out the CC-295 configuration for the Canadian Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue (FWSAR) program. This armed C295 is clearly a capable platform, with plenty of potential for light strike and ISR missions in less-contested environments, and is genuinely capable of executing multiple mission types in a single sortie. Its major advantages include the ability to fly missions of up to 10 hours (depending on weapons load and crew numbers) and the potential to integrate a variety of different armaments and sensors. What is more, in roll-on/roll-off configuration it can be rapidly adapted for more conventional transport and paratrooper missions, too. For an air force seeking a close air support and/or special operations support aircraft for counterinsurgency-type operations, the C295 could be ideal.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021",There Were Doomsday Ships Ready To Ride Out Nuclear Armageddon Before There Were Doomsday Planes,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Among the U.S. government’s ever-evolving plans for what to do in an all-out nuclear confrontation, some of the least known involved highly modified warships that were deployed during one of the tensest periods between the Soviet Union and the United States. Had the Cold War turned hot, the U.S. president likely would have called the shots in the ensuing nuclear exchange from one of these remarkable ‘floating White Houses.’ These fascinating vessels were in every way a part of the ancestory of today’s ‘doomsday plane’ airborne command posts . The program was officially known as the National Emergency Command Post Afloat, or NECPA, pronounced ‘neck-pa.’ It eventually yielded two specially equipped ships, the first of which, USS Northampton , began its new mission in March 1962. USS Northampton , in around 1959, when still equipped as a command light cruiser., U.S. Navy The Northampton had been built as an Oregon City class heavy cruiser, four of which were commissioned soon after World War II. The Northampton was completed as a command light cruiser, CLC-1, entering service in 1953 and then serving primarily as a flagship with the Atlantic Fleet. Because of its original role, the warship already featured an extra deck for command and control spaces. Adapted for the NECPA role, the Northampton was reclassified as the first command ship, CC-1, and was based in Norfolk, Virginia, within easy reach of Washington, D.C. Its codename was “Sea Ruler.” In times of crisis, the president and their closest aides would have been whisked by U.S. Marine Corps helicopters to the waters off the eastern seaboard, to board the Northampton . The modifications carried out to prepare the ship for its role in potential Armageddon were extensive, as Garrett M. Graff observes in his peerless book on the subject of U.S. government Doomsday plans, Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government’s Secret Plan To Save Itself — While the Rest Of Us Die : More than forty tons of gear, including sixty transmitters and receivers, allowed it to process 3,000 messages a day (considered at the time quite a feat), and the Navy claimed the powerful communications system allowed the ship to set the world record for the fastest around-the-globe message, taking just eight-tenths of a second. A year after the Northampton began its NECPA role, the Navy added a second ‘Floating White House’ to the fleet — USS Wright , codenamed “Zenith,” and also based at Norfolk. This warship had been completed as a Saipan class light aircraft carrier that first entered service in 1947 before being decommissioned for the first time in 1956. Although originally earmarked for use as an auxiliary aircraft transport, Wright was instead converted at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard as the second command ship, CC-2. Even more comprehensively equipped than the Northampton , Graff describes Wright as “the most sophisticated communications platform ever placed at sea” — as of 1963, at least. The former flight deck of the ship became increasingly dominated by aerials, the tallest being a set of 156-foot masts festooned with troposcatter antennas. USS Wright seen in 1967 with a less cluttered deck, but with a huge communications dish.  , USN A Navy press release soon after the ship had entered service enthused: The Wright has the most extensive communications facilities ever put aboard a ship. Its ‘Voice of Command’ can be heard by ships, aircraft, and stations throughout the world. Wright ’s command spaces have facilities for theatre-type presentations similar to command posts ashore, including projection equipment and huge motion picture screens. Overall, there are rooms for war operations, plotting, charts and graphics, emergency action, briefings, and conferences. On the antenna deck are arranged the largest, most powerful transmitting antenna systems ever installed on a naval vessel. An entire room is given to the ship’s teletype machines, each of which is capable of receiving incoming messages at the rate of 100 words per minute. The Wright is capable of handling as many messages in a day as many large shore-based communications stations. The former hangar space below deck was now filled with operations centers, with working areas and accommodation for 200 communications specialists, part of a complement of around 1,000 crew. There was also a team of 17 officers and 22 enlisted personnel from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who would have managed the ‘Floating White House’ during an emergency. The crew could also be increased in size if required, to cope with different eventualities. As for the president, they were provided with what Graff describes as an “elaborate, carpeted stateroom,” equipped with “nearly a dozen different color-coded telephones linked to various parts of the country’s military command structure.” The emergency operations center, which normally remained locked, featured the commander-in-chief’s desk and personnel could only enter with a security detail. In keeping with the presidential role, the Wright had three “themed” dining halls, where well-trained chefs provided the meals and a roaring log fire added to the atmosphere. President John F. Kennedy cuts a cake during a visit aboard the USS Northampton ., PUBLIC DOMAIN With the appropriate motto Vox Imperii , or “voice of the leaders,” the Wright would have used its antenna arrays to maintain contact with three specially constructed shore facilities, which in turn would have communicated with whatever was left of the U.S. military. If those three stations were to be destroyed, or communications with them lost, the Wright could deploy an unmanned QH-43 Huskie helicopter, a unique version of the Kaman design that could lift a super very-low-frequency antenna over two miles into the air and thereby communicate with Navy submarines around the globe. In all, there was space on the deck for three helicopters to be embarked. The same principle of a trailing very low-frequency antenna is used to this day by the Navy’s E-6B Mercury aircraft . Although of poor quality, this photo of a Navy UH-2B Seaprite utility helicopter visiting USS Wright , around 1966, also seems to show the unique QH-43 Huskie drone helicopter in the background., PUBLIC DOMAIN For operations in a nuclear environment, the Wright was equipped with special air filters so that the crew could be sealed off from fallout, while the decks would be washed down with a saltwater system. There were also plans to convert another Saipan class carrier, the lead ship of that class to NECPA configuration, as CC-3, but these were quickly abandoned and instead, this vessel became a communications relay platform. Thought was also given to another, and even more survivable, NECPA platform, based on the nuclear-powered submarine USS Triton , but this never progressed beyond studies in the mid-1960s. The Doomsday submarine that never was: the radar picket USS Triton seen in 1959. , U.S. Navy The operating principle behind NECPA called for one of these two vessels to be permanently at sea, with the ships rotating duty every two weeks. In this way, at least one of the vessels was afforded more protection against a surprise attack from the Soviet Union. In such a scenario, or other times of increased superpower tensions, the president and other national leaders would be transferred to the vessel that was on duty. In practice, the NECPA ship that was at sea would patrol around the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, generally within an area between Nova Scotia to the north and the Caribbean to the south, but usually operated within reasonable reach from Washington, D.C. During presidential trips to foreign countries, one of the NECPA vessels would frequently trail them, including on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s visit to Uruguay in 1967, and to El Salvador the following year. A letter from President Johnson to the commander of USS Northampton , after an overnight stay in 1966., PUBLIC DOMAIN As Graff points out, while little-known today, the NECPA ships were considered, at the time, to be the most survivable option for an evacuation of the president and their staff, prior to a nuclear strike. Indeed, the two ships seem to have been the Pentagon’s first choice for such a scenario all the way from the introduction of the Northampton in 1962 until midway through Nixon’s first term, which ran from 1969 until 1974. USS Northampton passes a fountain decorated with a Polaris missile at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum, Norfolk, Virginia, around 1962., PUBLIC DOMAIN It’s worth remembering that, to begin with, hardened land-based installations for “continuity of government” were considered fairly survivable , especially since the first atomic bombs were much less powerful than those deployed in the later years of the Cold War. Things changed entirely with the appearance of the first intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which provided a terrifying combination of speed (reducing warning time to 15-30 minutes) and accuracy, plus the arrival of far more destructive thermonuclear weapons with which to arm them. In the period in which these command ships were in commission, the other available options for the evacuation of the U.S. leadership involved hardened facilities on land, which could be decimated by a direct strike using thermonuclear ICBMs, or an airborne command post like the EC-135J Night Watch , which began its mission in 1962, but which could spend only a limited amount of time in the air before it would have to land. At the same time, the growing vulnerability of existing underground facilities did lead the United States to look at building super-shielded bunkers, including the Kubrick-esque Deep Underground Command Center that you can read about in this previous War Zone article . Former C-135 pilot and War Zone columnist Robert Hopkins explains that the EC-135J, though touted as able to stay aloft indefinitely with air refueling, would begin to run out of engine oil between 72 and 96 hours. Nuclear war planners assumed 72 hours would be the limit. Moreover, the availability of a tanker to actually refuel the jet during a full nuclear exchange must be considered doubtful. “After 48 hours, if not sooner, the crew will run out of food and water (especially) and human survivability after that becomes tedious,” Hopkins says. EC-135J Night Watch aircraft conduct aerial refueling., PUBLIC DOMAIN In comparison, the NECPA ships could remain in operation for weeks at sea and offered a high level of survivability. What’s more, they also offered plenty of space for the staff to manage national security and war-planning, as well as considerable redundancy in terms of communications to maintain a link along the chain of command. Exactly how survivable the NECPA vessels would have been in an actual shooting war remains somewhat open to question. Certainly, their ability to persist through a nuclear exchange was mainly attributed to the fact that they would be expected to avoid any encounters with a Soviet Navy that was, in this period, still building up its blue-water capabilities. However, the vessels both featured some limited armament. USS Northampton initially packed four of 5-inch dual-purpose guns, but eventually kept only a single aft turret, while the Wright had an array of 40mm Bofors guns to provide anti-aircraft firepower. Some reports state that they also retained their anti-submarine warfare sensors and other support systems that would have provided them with some level of organic situational awareness. One of the 5-inch gun turrets aboard USS Northampton as of 1962., PUBLIC DOMAIN Seen shortly before decommissioning in 1970, USS Northampton has had its armament reduced to a single 5-inch turret at the rear, due to the requirement for more command and control spaces within an enlarged superstructure., PUBLIC DOMAIN On the other hand, if the Soviet Navy was to track unprotected NECPA vessels, they would have potentially been easy targets for a shadowing submarine. Indeed, Graff notes that there were rumors among crews of the two ships that the U.S. Navy provided one of its own submarines as an escort while deployed at sea. Thankfully, neither of the NECPA ships were ever used in a full-on nuclear crisis situation, but they did at least go on alert during times of particular Cold War tensions. The Northampton was placed on alert during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, while the Wright was called upon during the Pueblo Incident in 1968 when a U.S. Navy intelligence ship was attacked and captured by North Korean forces. A U.S. Navy SP-2H Neptune flies over a Soviet cargo ship with crated Il-28 jet bombers on deck during the Cuban Crisis., U.S. Navy Both President John F. Kennedy and Johnson spent nights aboard the NECPA vessels, during exercises, as well as during the aforementioned foreign tours. Perhaps the most significant event in these ships’ fortunes came during President Johnson’s return from Uruguay aboard the Wright in 1967. On April 17, Strategic Air Command successfully used an EC-135 aircraft to launch an unarmed Minuteman II ICBM from its silo. This was the first time that this had been achieved and was a sign that the airborne command post was the future for the Doomsday command post force. By the end of the decade, moreover, the advent of Soviet spy satellites meant that the lumbering NECPA ships were no longer safe from prying eyes — their every movement could now potentially be tracked, putting them at the mercy of an ever more capable Soviet Navy’s surface warships, submarines, and aircraft. Even ICBMs could have been a risk. The U.S. Navy abandoned the NECPA program in around 1970 and the two ships were decommissioned the same year before eventually being sold for scrap: Northampton in 1977 and Wright in 1980. Three stricken cruisers, from left to right, USS Newport News (CA-148), USS Springfield (CG-7), and USS Northampton (CC-1) await disposal at Philadelphia Naval Base in October 1978. , PUBLIC DOMAIN Today, the job of these two ships is undertaken primarily by the U.S. Air Force’s fleet of four E-4B aircraft. Commonly referred to as “Doomsday Planes,” they provide a robust and survivable airborne command post that offers a platform for the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense, via a mechanism known as the National Command Authority (NCA), to initiate a nuclear strike. Like the NECPA ships that preceded them, however, they are also equipped to support a range of other major military operations or the response to other significant contingencies, such as large-scale natural disasters. However, the E-4Bs are now old aircraft, dating back to the 1970s, and are in the early stages of being replaced by a new platform, likely also to be based on the Boeing 747 airframe . In addition, the Air Force One VC-25As also conduct part of the “continuity of government” mission and is intended to operate in the most demanding situations, including a nuclear apocalypse. Air Force One has been modernized to better maintain communication with anyone on the ground or in the air and to stay abreast of a rapidly unfolding situation. The initiative to make it a more effective command post for the President came after the experience of 9/11, when President George H. W. Bush was aboard it and communications between the aircraft and major players on the ground broke down. The replacement of these aircraft with the VC-25B has led to concern that this mission set will be compromised, at least in part, by the new aircraft’s lack of aerial refueling capability . Currently, both E-4Bs and VC-25As have this capability. As for the aforementioned E-6B Mercury airborne strategic command aircraft, they too, continue to provide an alternate flying communications link to America’s nuclear-capable bombers , ballistic missile submarines , and ICBM silos. These aircraft, too, are scheduled for replacement . For the time being, it seems that if nuclear Armageddon does come, the hopes are that the U.S. President will be aloft in a bespoke “Doomsday Plane,” or a VC-25. When considering the critical role of these aircraft, and their planned successors, we should not forget the pioneering part played by their seagoing ancestors.

As a result, the truck holding area is often packed over its stated capacity. However, Younus Qazizada, the President of the Herat Chamber of Commerce, told the Associated Press that even more trucks had been parked there than usual when the fire started due to a dispute between truckers and Afghan authorities over increased customs duties.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 20, 2021",New Docs Show 1983 NATO Exercise Led To The Soviets Arming 100 Jets For Nuclear War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Soviet fighter jets, forward-based in what was then East Germany, were loaded with nuclear bombs and prepared for “immediate use,” as Moscow readied its forces for a potential full-scale war with NATO in 1983. These are among the latest details to have emerged about the ‘war scare’ that year, which saw the two sides on the brink of a major conflict, all due to very serious misunderstanding. The catalyst for the Soviets going onto a war footing in November 1983 was NATO’s upcoming annual Able Archer command post and communications exercise, which tested the ability of the alliance’s forces across Europe and beyond to conduct nuclear warfighting in a highly realistic fashion. Combined with other global tensions at that point in the Cold War, the Able Archer 83 maneuvers were misconstrued by the Soviets as genuine preparations for an all-out assault. A MiG-27D Flogger departs Grossenhain Air Base in former East Germany for the last time, as part of the withdrawal of Russian forces, in 1993., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons While the broad scope of this Cold War flashpoint has become much better known since the declassification in 2015 of a U.S. government report into the incident, details that reveal the seriousness of the situation, and how the Soviet side geared up for a nuclear war continue to emerge. The new revelations come from a new batch of intelligence documents on these events released by the U.S. State Department and they paint an alarming picture, as Soviet forces prepared for the Armageddon that their leaders seem to have sincerely expected was about to come. In the past, it was known that Able Archer’s warfighting simulations caused serious alarm among Moscow’s leadership. Since these drills used a scenario based on a nuclear attack on the Warsaw Pact, it’s easy to perceive how, if the intentions were misunderstood, that the situation could very quickly become extremely hazardous. The exercise scenario for Able Archer 83 itself began with the hypothetical enemy forces opening hostilities in Europe on November 4, after which NATO went on general alert. The virtual enemy initiated the use of chemical weapons on November 6. While this was all scripted, the exercise itself began on November 7 and ran over five days. It was based around a simulated transition from conventional and chemical warfare to a nuclear exchange. Above all, the drills were designed to give NATO command posts and communications networks training in this kind of escalation. The realism was such that among those involved were British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A U.S. Air Force after-action report from Able Archer 83., National Security Archive “In 1983,” a subsequent investigation by the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board stated, ”we may have inadvertently placed our relations with the Soviet Union on a hair-trigger.” What we can now understand, too, are some of the precise mechanisms that put the two superpowers onto a potential nuclear collision course. Derived from signals intelligence collected at the time, the documents describe how the Soviet military command posts across East Germany were ordered to be manned by augmented teams around the clock. In particular, we now know how the Soviet 16th Air Army, with its dozens of airbases scattered across East German territory, responded when the alarm was raised, being placed on a heightened state of alert on the evening of November 2. National Security Archive An impressive line-up of MiG-27s at Lärz Air Base, former East Germany, ahead of their withdrawal in 1993., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons As the spearhead of the 16th Air Army, the fighter-bomber divisions, which primarily flew MiG-27 Flogger and Su-17 Fitter combat jets, plus smaller numbers of swing-wing Su-24 Fencers , were the focus of much of the activity. It’s not surprising, too, that NATO was keeping a close eye on these units, as they would have been tasked with nuclear strikes against the alliance’s airfields, missile bases, and other key targets. It wasn’t just the 16th Air Army that was preparing for war, either. Further to the east, the Soviet 4th Air Army in Poland was also put on alert, on the orders of Marshal Pavel Kutakhov, the chief of the Soviet Air Forces. National Security Archive Among the fighter-bomber divisions, one squadron within each regiment was ordered to arm its aircraft with nuclear bombs. Typically, each regiment had three squadrons, of which one was a specialist in nuclear strike missions, regularly practicing loading and unloading weapons, and flying appropriate attack profiles. The now-declassified documents state that the nuclear-armed jets were put on 30-minute alert, with their crews briefed to “destroy first-line enemy targets.” Providing the intelligence is accurate, and one squadron from each of the eight Soviet fighter-bomber regiments in East Germany was armed with at least one nuclear bomb. That would have provided around 96 aircraft ready for a nuclear strike, depending on serviceability, based on a nominal squadron strength of 12. A Su-17M4 Fitter-K taxis at Gross Dölln Air Base, former East Germany., Rob Schleiffert/Wikimedia Commons It’s a little-known fact that within the Soviet Air Force’s tactical aviation branch, known as Frontal Aviation, almost all combat aircraft included a variant tailored for the carriage of freefall nuclear bombs. Even today, however, few details are available about the weapons themselves. As of 1983, the standard tactical nuclear bombs included the RN-40 and RN-41, carried by the MiG-23, MiG-27, MiG-29, Su-17, and Su-24. Western sources give the RN-40 an approximate yield of 30 kilotons — twice that of the “Little Boy” bomb that the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima near the end of World War II. As well as the nuclear weapons themselves, NATO intelligence confirmed that at least one of the Su-17M4 Fitter-Ks at Neuruppin Air Base — home of the 730th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment — was fitted with an electronic jamming pod for self-protection, more evidence that offensive missions were being planned. Intelligence gathered from the National Security Agency then revealed that the squadron encountered “an unexpected weight and balance problem” and was told to continue without the electronics gear. An original Western intelligence photo of one of the earlier Su-17M2 Fitter-D fighter-bombers, dated 1985 and almost certainly taken in East Germany., PUBLIC DOMAIN “This message meant that at least this particular squadron was loading a munitions configuration that they had never actually loaded before, i.e., a warload,” U.S. military intelligence analysts concluded at the time. The hazards of the 1983 ‘war scare’ are still all too clear to see, almost four decades later. After all, as mentioned before, this was a critical point in the Cold War. Before Able Archer, tensions had already been heightened by a variety of factors, including an escalating arms race, increasingly belligerent statements from leaders on both sides, leadership crises in the Soviet Union, and a previous ‘scare’ in which a serious malfunction led to a Soviet satellite control center to alert officials to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attack from the United States. In September 1983, just months before the annual Able Archer exercise, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL007) had been shot down by a Soviet Su-15 Flagon interceptor over the Sea of Japan, killing all 269 passengers and crew on board. After-action report map for the joint American, Japanese, and South Koreas search operations in international waters after the shootdown of KAL007., U.S. Navy While the regular Able Archer maneuvers were known to the Soviets, they still considered it most likely that World War III would begin with a surprise NATO attack under the cover of just such an exercise. When all these elements came together in late 1983, there was a terrifying sense of inevitability in how the Soviets began preparing for nuclear war. This, of course, is with the benefit of hindsight and it is fortunate that critical decision-makers at the time were not necessarily aware of how the Soviets had responded to the exercise. The recently released documents also include the testimony of Air Force Lieutenant General Leonard H. Perroots, who was, at the time, Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence within U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE), headquartered at Ramstein Air Base in then-West Germany. Perroots recalled contacting his superiors at the time of the ‘war scare,’ including the USAFE commander-in-chief, General Billy Minter. Lieutenant General Leonard H. Perroots, who later became Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency., U.S. Air Force Minter asked Perroots for his assessment of what was happening in East Germany and was told that there was “insufficient evidence to justify increasing our real alert posture.” But Perroots admitted later that, as more details became available about the status of the Soviet forces across the border, he became ever more concerned. “If I had known then what I later found out I am uncertain what advice I would have given,” he later admitted. Perroots maintained that he had made the right call in not recommended an escalation on the NATO side. However, he was aware that he lacked a complete picture of the preparations that the Soviets were making. It was only after the exercise that he began to realize just how serious the situation appeared, including what was happening across Soviet airbases in East Germany. On this occasion, we should probably all be thankful that Perroots was not a party to the details of Soviet preparations for a nuclear war that we now have to hand. All in all, the 1983 ‘war scare’ continues to provide sobering reminders of the dangers of nuclear brinkmanship and how suspicions between foes can rapidly escalate into something altogether much more perilous.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 24, 2021",B-1B Bomber That Was Just Retired Almost Got Scrapped More Than A Decade Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has sent the first of 17 B-1B bombers to the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona as part of a plan to consolidate the fleet and improve its readiness rates . The aircraft in question, which carries the serial number 85-0066, actually escaped being scrapped more than a decade ago after suffering a fire that caused major damage, including to total loss of its right wing, at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The B-1B, previously assigned to the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, touched down at the Bone Yard on Feb. 17, 2021. The Air Force had first announced its plan to divest 17 of these bombers in its budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year. Congress subsequently signed off the plan in the most recent annual policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Then-President Donald Trump had vetoed that legislation in December 2020, but that was overridden on Jan. 1. A B-1B bomber with the serial number 85-0066 leaves Ellsworth Air Force Base on Feb. 17, 2021, for the Bone Yard., USAF “Due to the wear and tear placed on the B-1 fleet over the past two decades, maintaining these bombers would cost 10s of millions of dollars per aircraft to get back to status quo,” Air Force General Tim Ray, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, said of the group of B-1Bs set to be retired in the coming months. “And that’s just to fix the problems we know about. We’re just accelerating planned retirements.” Prior to yesterday, the Air Force had a total of 62 B-1Bs left in service, two of which are dedicated test and evaluation aircraft. The Air Force expects to have retired all of the B-1Bs by 2036, replacing them with B-21 Raider stealth bombers . “Beginning to retire legacy bombers, to make way for the B-21 Raider, is something we have been working toward for some time,” General Ray also said. “The divestiture of the B-1 is necessary in order for the Air Force to create an even more lethal, agile, and sustainable force with a greater competitive edge for tomorrow’s fight.” A B-1B bomber., Tyler Rogoway Of the 17 that will now go to the Bone Yard, four will be placed in so-called “recallable” or “Type 2000” storage, meaning that they will be kept in a state where they can be more readily reactivated and returned to service, if necessary. This is a step down from “ Type 1000 ” storage, where aircraft are maintained to an even more substantial degree. Even then, it can take months for a bomber-sized aircraft to leave the Bone Yard and return to active duty. A total of 100 B-1Bs were built between 1983 and 1988, 33 of which had already been retired as part of an earlier consolidation effort between 2002 and 2003. A number of other jets were lost in accidents over the years. Previously retired B-1B airframes, among others, at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base., Google Earth 85-0066 was almost among those accidental losses. In September 2005, the jet burst into flames just after landing at Andersen on Guam. The incident was traced to leaking hydraulic fluid coming into contact with hot wheel brakes. Thankfully, the crew was able to exit the jet safely, but the damage was extensive. The right wing was determined to be a total loss, as were the engine nacelles, landing gear, and various panels and fairings on that side of the aircraft. The total cost of the damage was pegged at around $32 million. The Air Force initially decided to scrap the jet, the wreckage of which had remained at Andersen after the mishap. However, the service determined that it would still cost $12 million to break the jet down and ship its remains out of Guam. A different B-1B from the 28th Bomb Wing takes off from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam in 2016., USAF More than a year after the accident, the decision was made to repair the aircraft. A combination of parts sourced from other locations, including components taken from other B-1Bs at the Bone Yard in Arizona, as well as items made locally at Andersen, were used to get 85-0066 airworthy again. “It was in pretty bad shape,” Steve Hillian, an aircraft mechanic from the 565th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron who was part of the depot field team that repaired the jet on Guam, said in 2009 . “There were a lot of problems for a plane that had been sitting for two years and had not been moved. It was more involved than a regular PDM [Programmed Depot Maintenance].” “One of the major challenges that faced us when we were out there was not all the parts from other aircraft were completely interchangeable,” Tate Valentine, another mechanic from the 565th who was involved in getting the B-1B fixed, also said at that time. “Sometimes you have to do what you got to do to make parts fit and sometimes it took quite a while… It was basically a big jigsaw puzzle, taking these large round pegs and putting them in square holes.” The work on 85-0066 on Guam represented the first time the entire wing assembly on a B-1B, which is a complicated component, to begin with, due to the aircraft’s swing-wing design, had ever been replaced outside of a full-service depot. Having been left out in the elements, “the aircraft was exposed to Guam’s humid climate and had extensive corrosion,” the Air Force also noted, adding time and complexity to the process. In 2008, the jet was flyable enough to leave Andersen and head to Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma for more extensive repairs. Another B-1B, “in the white” with its paint stripped, at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma after a major overhaul., USAF The aircraft finally returned to active duty in 2009. For a time, at least, 85-0066 carried the nickname “Get Your Kicks,” a reference to both the famous blues song Route 66 and its serial number, but the personnel at Tinker were also calling it “Frankenstein” by the time the repairs were complete. https://youtube.com/watch?v=SJe_WWSDqqY After more than a decade of continued service, 85-0066 has now actually been retired. The Air Force is insistent that sending this jet and the 16 other oldest B-1Bs to the Bone Yard is essential to keeping the rest of the fleet operationally useful for the next 15 years. “Retiring aircraft with the least amount of usable life allows us to prioritize the health of the fleet and crew training,” General Ray said. “Our ability to balance these priorities will make us more capable and lethal overall.” Though they are now entering the twilight part of their careers, the remaining B-1Bs are still set to receive upgrades and other improvements in the coming years, too. There are notably plans to expand the combat capability of these jets, including the reactivation of a number of external pylons and the integration of new hypersonic missiles . The Air Force is also eying them for new roles, including as an important anti-ship platform . The retirement of aircraft is always somewhat bittersweet, especially for the crews that flew and maintained them, but 85-0066 had already very much gotten a second lease on life once before.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2021",Air Force Boss Wants Clean-Sheet Fighter That’s Less Advanced Than F-35 To Replace F-16,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking at an all-new fighter jet design to replace its F-16s , which currently provide the backbone of the tactical fleet. Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr. is launching a months-long study into the service’s future force mix, which could include a “clean-sheet design” to replace the F-16 and which could potentially threaten long-held plans to buy 1,763 copies of the F-35A , originally intended as the F-16’s successor. Speaking yesterday at the Defense Writers Group, Brown — a former F-16 instructor pilot — introduced his idea for a new “four-and-a-half-gen or fifth-gen-minus” fighter to supersede the Viper. The tactical aircraft (TacAir) study will be one proposal under investigation as the Air Force assesses the optimum balance for its tactical fighter force and will be run in concert with the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). The first-ever formation of F-16s equipped with new Active Electronically Scanned Array radars over Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, July 2, 2020., U.S. Air Force/Jack Harman “This will help inform the decisions that I think I need to make internal to the Air Force, and what I would recommend that force mix might be,” Brown explained. “Now, I will also tell you I don’t think that everybody’s going to exactly agree with what I say. But I want to actually have a starting point as a point of departure, a point of dialogue.” General Brown says he hopes that the force mix study will be completed in time to help inform decisions for the Air Force’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget request. “In the budget for FY 23, that’s where I see that we’ll really make some key decisions,” he added. What the Air Force Chief of Staff has in mind is not an order for an advanced version of the F-16, such as the latest Block 70/72 version , something that outgoing Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Will Roper, suggested could happen, in an interview with Aviation Week last month . General Brown was vehement that the F-16 — even a much-improved version of the 1970s-era jet — is not the right choice for the future Air Force. He pointed to the Viper’s inability to receive software updates at the speed that’s desired and its lack of open-architecture software protocols that would allow it to be rapidly reconfigured. Brown said he would want the new aircraft to feature “open-mission systems” — something that the Air Force has recently been testing in live flying scenarios involving manned aircraft . This kind of open architecture design would allow the new fighter to receive software updates in rapid succession, potentially even during a mission . Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown Jr., U.S. Air Force/Andy Morataya Instead, what the Air Force will consider is the manufacture of “something new and different, that’s not the F-16 — that has some of those capabilities but gets there faster and uses some of our digital approach,” Brown said. The reference to speed hints at a platform that will be quicker than the F-16, perhaps indicating a desire for a supercruise capability. Overall, higher speed would not only help boost sortie rates but also increase survivability in contested environments. This “digital approach” could well be fundamental to the whole idea of a new tactical fighter for the Air Force and echoes the “Digital Century Series” that was another Roper brainchild. In this concept, smaller numbers of aircraft are rapidly produced to meet dynamically evolving threats, keeping pace with peer threats like China and Russia. A similar type of digital engineering — the so-called eSeries concept — has also become a hallmark of the Air Force’s new T-7A Red Hawk trainer , as well as the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which is taking a system-of-systems approach to developing future aerial combat capabilities. Last September, Roper confirmed that some form of NGAD prototype had already flown , but Brown suggested the new tactical fighter would be tailored to work complementary to NGAD, as well as the F-35. The Boeing/Saab T-7A Red Hawk trainer., Boeing Indeed, Brown specifically named all three programs, pointing out that each was needed “to remain competitive against our adversaries” as well as to conduct the “low-end fight.” It might be surmised, therefore, that the proposed new tactical fighter would either be optimized to some degree for low-end warfare — like the type of asymmetric combat that the Air Force has been involved in for years in Afghanistan and the Middle East — or its design would otherwise incorporate lessons from these campaigns. The idea of the tactical aircraft (TacAir) study is “to look at what is the right force mix,” he said, explaining that the service needs fifth-generation fighters such as the F-35; it needs NGAD “to remain competitive against our adversaries;” and, it needs capabilities for the “low-end fight.” At this point, there is no timeline for any kind of prototype or demonstrator to be produced for the TacAir study, although experience with the NGAD suggests that would at least be feasible in relatively short order. Instead, however, Brown said the focus now is on “modeling and simulation and analysis,” adding that “that’s what I plan to do here over the coming months.” Beyond that, any decision on where the program would go next would also be based on the findings of CAPE — the body that advises the Pentagon on alternative weapon systems and force structures as well as their cost-effectiveness. Crew chiefs assigned prepare to launch F-35As during a Red Flag exercise at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada., U.S. Air Force/R. Nial Bradshaw As well as CAPE, Brown’s TacAir study is supposed to align with another, separate study, the new Global Posture Review, which is described as a “review to ensure the footprint of American service members worldwide is correctly sized and supports strategy.” This will consider, for example, the future status of forward-deployed Air Force assets. “I think the dialogue back and forth between the two will help shape the Global Posture Review; at the same time, the Global Posture Review will help shape our TacAir study based on the priorities the department has laid out,” Brown said. As well as assessing if there’s a place for a future “clean-sheet design” in the tactical fighter inventory, Brown says it might be time to reassess the service’s aim to field 386 squadrons across the Air Force. In 2018 the service unveiled its plans to massively expand force structure from 312 squadrons to 386 by 2030, a plan that The War Zone discussed in detail in this previous feature . U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotankers, C-17 Globemaster IIIs, and KC-46 Pegasus aircraft line up for an elephant walk at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Tankers and airlifters are also part of the squadron numbers conundrum. , U.S Air Force/Tech. Sgt. Kenneth W. Norman “I want to get as close as I can to 386 capability with the force size that I have, with the dollars we have available and make that case,” Brown confirmed. Moreover, the Air Force chief hopes that the kinds of capabilities embodied in a revised tactical fighter mix could also achieve the desired capability with fewer than 386 squadrons. The observation about what this will all cost is critical, of course. The Air Force is already under pressure to pay for the F-35 — the most expensive program in Pentagon history — as well as NGAD, with the potential to add another new tactical fighter on top of this. In the meantime, the Air Force has also committed to buying new F-15EX fighter jets to top up its current tactical fleet, while there will also be various unmanned programs that also demand a share of the budget. That is not to mention all the other initiatives outside of the Air Force’s tactical airpower portfolio. The trifecta of NGAD, F-15EX, and — potentially — something else under TacAir further emphasizes that the F-35 program is starting to come under increasing pressure, too. An artist’s concept of a manned NGAD fighter., Lockheed Martin There is also the issue of unmanned options and the fact the Air Force is increasingly looking to integrating combat drones within its tactical aviation fleet. It is too early to say how that will affect plans for the manned fighter force mix, but it seems inevitable that the trend will have a major impact, more generally, on plans for future combat fleets . With an Air Force fighter fleet that averages 28 years old, Brown recognizes “that’s not going to compete well with adversaries.” The TacAir study will therefore look at how to bring down the average age while remaining affordable — something it seems the F-35 is struggling to achieve. The Air Force F-35A buy is still officially pegged at 1,763 aircraft but last December Aviation Week reported that, as early as 2018, the service had prepared a study that called for F-35A orders to be cut back to 1,050. The F-35’s assembly line at Fort Worth, Texas., Lockheed Martin Although the unit prices for all F-35 variants have been decreasing in the years since then, concerns have grown about the sustainment costs of the jets. In 2019, the U.S. military assessed it would cost $1.196 trillion just to operate and maintain the full planned fleets of F-35s across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy through 2070. Brown admitted that the F-35 is currently having problems with engine wear and that the TacAir study would factor this in, too. He said that the jet’s F135 engines are “failing a little faster in certain areas,” as a result of heavy usage and regular deployments . While changes to maintenance are being looked at, Brown also confirmed that one solution to the issue may simply be to use the F-35 less. The Air Force is also facing a shortage of F135 engines, as increased demands for repairs cause a logjam in scheduled depot maintenance. Officials recently admitted this is an issue that could take months to solve. Pratt & Whitney’s F135 engine, used in the F-35A, during ground testing., U.S. Air Force/Rick Goodfriend “I want to moderate how much we’re using those aircraft,” Brown said . “You don’t drive your Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays. This is our ‘high end’ [fighter], we want to make sure we don’t use it all for the low-end fight.” One solution to that low-end fight could, of course, be the new fighter now being examined under the TacAir study. It is becoming abundantly apparent that the Air Force is having second thoughts about whether it can actually afford the planned 1,763 F-35As, something that would have been hard to predict would happen just a couple of years ago. More recently, even the F-15EX acquisition faced pushback from those who felt it would threaten the F-35 enterprise . The 56th Operations Group flagship F-16 escorts Luke Air Force Base’s first F-35A to the base in March 2014. , U.S. Air Force/Jim Hazeltine It is highly significant that so far this year both Roper and Brown have suggested that a new F-16 model, or something like it, could be introduced to the Air Force and potentially reduce F-35 numbers in the process. Speaking in January, before stepping down as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Will Roper said he thought the F-35A was “a long way from being an affordable fighter that we can buy in bulk.” He added that he expected to see “other trades in terms of numbers of F-35s, up or down, and capability mixes with Block 4 vs. things one might do with F-15EX or NGAD.” “That’s why other tactical aviation options are appealing to have in the mix so that the Air Force has options,” Roper added. That approach would seem to be in line with Brown’s plans to look at how a new tactical fighter might fit into the mix. What that fighter may look like, and whether the Air Force will be able to pay for it alongside the F-35 and NGAD, remain to be seen, however.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 15, 2019",The Air Force Finally Has Its First New AT-6E Wolverine Light Attack Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has taken delivery of its first Beechcraft AT-6E Wolverine single-engine turboprop light attack aircraft. The service has said in the past that it could acquire up to three of these aircraft to support a program called the Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AEROnet, focused on developing a low-cost communications and data-sharing architecture to help allies and partners work together better during coalition operations. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, announced the arrival of the AT-6E on Feb. 17, 2021. The AT-6E is a variant of the T-6 Texan II trainer from Beechcraft, a division of Textron, configured for light attack and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The Air Force, as well as the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army, already operate unarmed versions of the Texan II. Beechcraft’s AT-6E demonstrator., Textron “A new aircraft just entered the @usairforce fleet!,” a post from AFLCMC’s official Twitter account said. “Congrats to our Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate’s Light Attack Aircraft Program Office, for leading efforts to acquire and field @TextronAviation’s AT-6 Wolverine!” “Making history in the Air Capital of the World — Congratulations to @usairforce for receiving its first @Beechcraft  AT-6E Wolverine,” Textron’s Twitter account wrote in response . The most immediately visible difference between the AT-6E, which Beechcraft has marketed in the past as the AT-6B, AT-6C, or simply the AT-6, and standard Texan II trainers are its six underwing pylons. These can accommodate various precision-guided bombs and missiles, as well as rocket and gun pods, among other stores. It has an additional station under the fuselage, which is typically occupied by a sensor turret containing electro-optical and infrared cameras. The Air Force’s model reportedly has a WESCAM MX-15D turret, which also includes a laser designator, from L3Harris. The AT-6E that the Air Force just received also has a prominent circular antenna on top of its nose typically associated with satellite communications systems. “The aircraft features an impressive array of communication capabilities with ARC-210 radio s/VHF/UHF/AES Encryption/SATCOM/ Iridium Cell Satellite /AERONet/ Full motion ROVER video /GPS precision approach and more,” according to a piece from The Aviationist last year. That same story said the aircraft had the same mission computer as the Air Force’s A-10Cs and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls derived from those on F-16 fighter jets . This particular AT-6E interestingly has a green-and-gray paint job that appears to be at least inspired by a pattern known as European One . Many Air Force aircraft, including A-10 ground attack jets, wore this camouflage scheme during the latter stages of the Cold War and immediately afterward. A close-up of the USAF’s AT-6E showing part of its camouflage paint scheme., USAF An A-10 Warthog seen wearing the European One camouflage scheme in 1988., USAF The Air Force announced that Air Combat Command (ACC) could get as many as three AT-6s to support work on AEROnet in 2019 and that system is the centerpiece of these aircraft. “Think of the partner nations that wouldn’t necessarily be allowed to have Type 1 encryption, which is the encryption we have in Link 16 and things like that, but we still need to build our coalition,” then-Air Force Brigadier General Michael Schmidt, the Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, and Networks at AFLCMC, said at a conference in 2019. Schmidt has since been promoted to Major General. “What can we offer in a network that is exportable, that meets all the security requirements that can interlink people with each other and with us, that can take advantage of all the different communication systems that are out there already,” now-retired Air Force General Mike Holmes, then head of ACC, said at the same event. “You’re offering a network that has airplanes, too, that fit in with it and not, here’s a big airplane, now go figure out how you’re going to talk to it and how you’re going to use it.” It’s worth noting that this is not the first time the Air Force has experimented with an AT-6 variant. The service has tested these aircraft on multiple occasions as part of various programs stretching back more than a decade now. The decision to buy Wolverines for the AEROnet tests followed on from an abortive effort that began in 2017, which was intended to pave the way for the acquisition of hundreds of low-cost light attack aircraft. The goal of that project was to reduce the strain on higher-end combat jet fleets and provide more persistent, flexible, and cheaper firepower to support operations in permissive environments. You can read more about this entire saga, and past failed Air Force light attack program, in detail in this past War Zone piece . Members of the Air National Guard look at an example of what was then known as the AT-6C during tests in 2010. Interestingly two AIM-9X air-to-air missiles are among the ordnance laid out in front of the aircraft., USAF The cancellation of that Light Attack Aircraft (LAA) program also led into a plan to get up to three Embraer A-29 Super Tucanos via the U.S.-based Sierra Nevada Corporation for Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). AFSOC would then use those single-engine turboprop light attack aircraft to help Combat Aviation Advisors, who are themselves tasked with training and advising foreign air forces. A number of American allies and partners already operate, or are planning to operate, both the A-29 and the AT-6 . It’s unclear whether AFSOC is still pursuing that acquisition effort or not. That command has also been trying to acquire new light attack/ISR aircraft that it could use to support lower-end counter-terrorism and similar operations as part of a program called Armed Overwatch . Last year, Congress blocked its request for funds to begin buying planes to meet those requirements in the 2021 Fiscal Year. However, AFSOC Commander Air Force Lieutenant General James Slife said just recently that he is optimistic that legislators can be convinced to allocate money for this project in the next fiscal cycle. No matter what happens with AFSOC’s Armed Overwatch program in the next year or so, the Air Force does now have its first AT-6E to begin supporting the AEROnet project.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021",Requirements For New Air Force Doomsday Planes Seem To Preclude Anything But 747s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is pushing ahead with its Survivable Airborne Operations Center program, or SAOC, to replace its aging fleet of E-4B Nightwatch aircraft , also known as National Airborne Operations Centers, or NAOCs. The requirements for the future SAOCs remain highly classified, but details continue to trickle out suggesting that the aircraft that the service wants will have a similar size and general layout, including four engines, to the existing Boeing 747-based E-4Bs, if it is not based on a Jumbo Jet airframe itself. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s (AFLCMC) Presidential Airlift Directorate, which is overseeing the SAOC effort, issued a new contracting notice regarding the program on Feb. 17, 2021. “The Government intends to continue to pursue a full and open acquisition strategy for the entire weapon system using a very large platform,” it read. An E-4B Nightwatch aircraft, also known as a National Airborne Operations Center., USAF This follows the public disclosure that a decision had been made to allow interested companies to submit SAOC proposals involving modified used commercial aircraft in December 2020. The Air Force has offered no further substantive information about its requirements for this aircraft. The relevant System Requirements Document (SRD) is classified. Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ‘s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , noted last year that the option of starting with a used commercial aircraft opened a new door to using a 747 airframe, among others, for the SAOC. Today, he noted that the stipulation that the plane would have to be a “very large platform” also pointed to Jumbo Jet-based offerings being very likely contenders. That the SAOC’s specific requirements, including physical parameters and how many engines it needs to have, are tightly controled is hardly surprising. Commonly referred to as “Doomsday Planes,” the main mission of the Air Force’s four existing E-4Bs is to provide a robust and survivable airborne command post that offers a platform for the President of the United States, via a mechanism known as the National Command Authority (NCA), to initiate a nuclear strike. It can also be employed to direct other major military operations or the response to other significant contingencies, including large-scale natural disasters, if necessary. Typically, one of these aircraft shadows the President when they fly on one of the VC-25A Air Force One aircraft overseas. They are also often employed as a means of transporting the Secretary of Defense to foreign countries. You can read more about the E-4Bs and their missions, which are an essential component of overarching continuity of government plans that ensure national-level authorities continue to function in even the most serious crises, in this past War Zone piece . Three of the four E-4Bs started life as E-4A Advanced Airborne Command Posts (AACP), which first entered service in the mid-1970s. These were later converted to the improved NAOC standard in the 1980s. A fourth aircraft in the NAOC configuration was also subsequently acquired. All of these aircraft are based on the 747-200B airframe, as are the two VC-25A Air Force One jets. One of the Air Force’s two VC-25A Air Force One aircraft, which, like the E-4Bs, are based on the Boeing 747-200B., AP There have already been other signs that the Air Force might be increasingly interested in another 747-based platform for the SAOC. In 2017, it had emerged that the service, together with the U.S. Navy, were exploring a possible common replacement aircraft for the E-4B, as well as the E-6B Mercury and C-32A types. The E-6B is another airborne strategic command post designed to provide an alternate flying communications link to America’s nuclear-capable bombers , ballistic missile submarines , and intercontinental ballistic missile silos. These aircraft took on the roles that had previously been filled by separate Air Force and Navy aircraft performing missions referred to as the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) and Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO), respectively. An E-6B Mercury., USAF The C-32As, commonly known as Air Force Twos, are executive transports that are also used to ferry around the President, depending on the nature of the trip, as well as the Vice President and other senior officials and their entourages. A C-32A Air Force Two., Tyler Rogoway In 2019, however, the Air Force appeared to shelve what had become known as the NEAT program, a nested acronym combining NAOC, Executive Airlift, ABNCP, and TACAMO, in favor of SAOC. The SAOC effort, as already noted, is focused only on replacing the E-4B. In 2020, the Navy announced it was looking for a new dedicated TACAMO aircraft based on the four-engine C-130J turboprop airlifter . The C-32A is notably based on the twin-engine Boeing 757, while the E-6B is derived from the four-engine Boeing 707, as well. All told there is growing evidence that differences in requirements, including with regards to total engines, led to the collapse of the NEAT program’s idea of acquiring a single type to perform all of these mission sets. This is similar to what is understood to have happened with regards to the decision to use a 747-based design for the future VC-25B Air Force One aircraft. Those two jets are also notably being converted from 747-8i airliners originally destined for a now-defunct Russian airline . One of two 747-8i airliners destined to become VC-25B Air Force One aircraft., Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films A briefing that the Air Force gave to then-President Elect Donald Trump in December 2016 made clear the significance of the four-engine requirement for the VC-25B. A four-engine aircraft with one engine out would translate to “land as soon as practical,” while the loss of one engine on a two-engine plane would require it to “land as soon as possible,” one of the slides explained. The War Zone obtained this briefing for Trump, who was then a major critic of the Air Force One replacement program , along with a number of others via the Freedom of Information Act, and you can read more about them in this past feature . A slide from a briefing on Air Force One given then President Elect Donald Trump in 2016 talking about the aircraft’s unique requirements, including the demand for four engines rather than only two., USAF via FOIA It’s not at all hard to see how the Air Force could have arrived at the same conclusion with regards to the E-4B. While the NEAT program was going on, there had been discussion, including here at The War Zone , about potentially using a twin-engine design, such as one based on the KC-46A Pegasus tanker , which is itself derived from the Boeing 767. The decision to use the 747-8i as the basis for the VC-25B could also have impacted the thinking regarding the E-4B’s eventual replacement. The design of the Nightwatch aircraft, including its communication suite, hardening against electromagnetic pulses for nuclear detonations, and more, had informed that of the VC-25As. Leveraging any significant amount of work that has already been done in the development of the conversion plan for the new Air Force One jets could help lower the costs and complexities associated with crafting a 747-8i-based SAOC. In addition, the Air Force’s public announcement that it would allow proposals involving used commercial airframes for the SAOC program came after Boeing announced last year that it would halt 747 production for good after building the remaining aircraft it has on order now. As such, any new 747-based airborne command posts would have to use second-hand Jumbo Jets as the starting point. It’s possible that Boeing could be convinced to delay its plans to shut down the production line for these planes, but that prospect already seems increasingly remote. A Boeing 747 under construction., Boeing On top of all that, there are few, if any, real alternatives, new or used, to the 747 if the Air Force’s definition of “very large platform” is based on the size of the existing E-4Bs. Aviation Week ‘s Trimble said that this was especially true “assuming used [Airbus] A380s are off the table.” The European aerospace consortium is set to stop making A380s this year , with less than 300 examples built in the past 17 years or so, compared to the more than 1,500 747s of all variants that Boeing has built since the 1960s. As such, the A380 has a much more limited supplier base to support it. It’s hard to see the Air Force choosing a foreign design as the basis for the SAOC, for operational security and political reasons, anyway. It’s also interesting to note that Lockheed had proposed an airborne command post variant of its massive C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft , which is also no longer in production, as a possible replacement for some of the aircraft that the E-6Bs ultimately supplanted. You can read more about the EC-5B concept in this past War Zone piece . Of course, it still remains to be seen exactly what aircraft the Air Force might ultimately select for the SAOC. That being said, there are steadily growing signs that the service is leaning more and more toward a 747-based design.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Mar 3, 2021",Russia Claims Its Su-57 Felon Fighter Has Been Testing A New Hypersonic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s new-generation Su-57 Felon fighter jet has reportedly begun flight tests carrying prototypes of what’s claimed to be a new hypersonic air-to-ground missile. Unnamed sources from Russia’s military-industrial complex told a state-run media outlet that the Su-57 has already completed several test flights with the as yet unidentified weapon, but it’s not yet been launched. The missiles reportedly used in the tests are described as “functional” full-size mock-ups. According to the anonymous source quoted by Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti , the dummy missiles lack a propulsion system, fuel, and warhead but are otherwise identical to the real weapon in terms of weight and dimensions. One of the prototype Su-57 Felon fighters., MARINA LYSTSEVA/TASS VIA GETTY IMAGES Furthermore, the test versions of the weapon include “seeker heads and electrical circuits […] to check the interface of the munitions’ electronics with the onboard equipment of the launch aircraft,” the source added. Essentially, this sounds similar to what, in the Western world, would be termed captive-carry missiles . The reported new hypersonic missile, which is said to be carried internally in the Su-57, is described as “a compact, air-to-surface weapon intended to destroy adversary air and missile defense systems, and cruise and ballistic missile launchers.” The specific mention of fuel for the missile could suggest an air-breathing weapon, but that can’t be confirmed. Air-breathing hypersonic weapons typically employ scramjet engines , a type of ramjet that functions at speeds in excess of Mach 5. Prior to being carried by the Su-57 for the flight tests, the weapon was tested for fit in the aircraft’s internal weapons bays on the ground, the report adds. The same sources told the agency that the first launches of the new weapon can be expected from the Su-57 “in the near future.” RIA Novosti approached the Tactical Missile Armament Corporation , also known by its Russian acronym KTRV, for comment, but the company did not respond. However, it suggests this could be the firm tasked with designing and producing the weapon. That wouldn’t be unexpected, since KTRV is responsible for a wide range of ordnance for manned and unmanned combat aircraft, as well as various other types of weaponry . The new weapon is said to be “small-sized” and capable of “maneuvering flight at hypersonic speed for a long duration.” The size of the missile and its apparent optimization for the Su-57, above all, suggest that it is among the weapons that Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu mentioned on February 9 this year. Shoigu claimed that, in the future, Russia’s non-nuclear deterrent forces would be based around hypersonic missile systems of “various types.” Russia already employs an air-launched hypersonic strike weapon, the Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile system . This combines a modified MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor with the Iskander surface-to-surface missile , which has reportedly received the NATO codename Killjoy in its air-launched form. The Kinzhal missile was developed by the Machine Building Design Bureau, or KBM, outside Moscow and entered service with the Russian Aerospace Forces’ MiG-31 regiment at Kansk in central Russia in December 2017. A MiG-31 carries the Kinzhal aero-ballistic missile., Russian Ministry of Defense When President Vladimir Putin revealed the Kinzhal in his annual state-of-the-nation speech in 2018 , he said it could deliver nuclear and conventional warheads over a range of 1,200 miles and that the missile flies “at a hypersonic speed, ten times faster than the speed of sound.” Ballistic missiles, by their very nature, can operate in the hypersonic realm. Although the development of the Kinzhal system seems to have eclipsed work on similar ramjet-powered strike weapons, at least for now, Russia, and the Soviet Union before it, has considerable experience with air-launched high-speed weapons, and ramjets in particular . Toward the end of the Soviet era, the Raduga missile company produced the GELA near-hypersonic experimental vehicle, intended as the prototype for the Kh-90 strategic air-launched cruise missile. This would have used a ramjet engine to accelerate to a speed of Mach 4.5 and travel over 1,800 miles, but the program was canceled in 1992. The GELA hypersonic experimental vehicle., Nickel nitride/Wikimedia Commons More recently, attention has returned to these types of weapons, including the GZUR program run by KTRV and Raduga, and which was active by 2012. This is thought to be a two-phase effort, starting with a Mach-6 ramjet-powered missile weighing around 3,000 pounds and sized to fit in the 20-foot weapons bay of the Tu-95MS Bear-H bomber . Its range is expected to be in the region of 900 miles. At one point it was reportedly intended to be followed by a Mach-12 weapon that would be capable of hitting targets at intercontinental range. Some development is known to have taken place on the GZUR program, including work on a passive radar seeker, and flight tests of an experimental hypersonic vehicle from a Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bomber . All these weapons could potentially provide a hypersonic capability but are too large for internal carriage in the Su-57, which can accommodate missiles up to a length of just under 14 feet. This suggests the purported “functional” mock-up either represents an entirely new design, or perhaps a missile that’s related to the Brahmos II. This is a hypersonic weapon being developed by Russia and India, with the missile itself being the responsibility of NPO Mashinostroeniya, a subsidiary of KTRV. Meanwhile, there have also been suggestions that the Brahmos II could be related to Russia’s enigmatic Zircon naval hypersonic missile , which is planned to arm a range of Russian Navy warships . Little is known about the specifics of the Brahmos II, other than it’s a follow-on to the original supersonic Brahmos and that it’s expected to be sized for (external) carriage by the Indian Air Force’s Su-30MKI Flanker multirole fighter , as well as a variety of other platforms. Reportedly, the Brahmos II could have a top speed of Mach 8 and a range of 620 miles. A scale model of the Brahmos II., Shiv Aroor/Wikimedia Commons Regardless of any potential relationship between the reported new weapon and the Brahmos II, a hypersonic weapon could help make the Su-57 a more attractive option to potential export customers . So far, Russia has placed orders for just 76 production Felons , the first of which was delivered last December 24, although it seems likely that a missile of this type could eventually be carried by other Russian fighters, too. In the meantime, Russia is working on other weapons tailored to the Su-57, as well, including the Kh-58UShK anti-radiation missile that features folding wings and fins, and the Kh-69, a subsonic air-to-surface weapon apparently intended to destroy hardened targets of known coordinates at a range of 180 miles or more. On top of these, there are also various short-range and longer-range air-to-air missiles , also optimized for internal carriage, in the development pipeline for the Su-57. A dual-mode infrared/radar-guided Kh-58UShK model. Behind it is the Kh-59MK2 , which now seems to have been further developed as the Kh-69., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons Clearly, a hypersonic air-to-ground missile would add a powerful new capability to the Su-57, or any other aircraft that might be equipped with it. In the past , The War Zone has examined how these types of weapons could be potentially game-changing. Although details of the reported new weapon’s speed and range are unknown, the missile could hit targets in very short order, providing very little time to respond with weapons or other countermeasures — providing those weapons are even fast enough to catch it. On the other hand, actually developing a hypersonic weapon in this class — especially one scaled to fit within a fighter’s internal weapons bays — is no easy feat. In the past, Russia has made bold claims about the development of advanced weapons, including nuclear supercarriers and various new fighters , that have failed to progress. Developing a small, air-launched, potentially air-breathing hypersonic weapon is a huge technological undertaking. It’s also possible that this is a smaller ballistic-like missile, similar to Israel’s Rampage , which may be able to reach near hypersonic terminal velocity, we just don’t know. No matter what, its range will be limited if a valid design is possible and it is sized for internal carriage. Only time will tell if this reported new weapon is actually feasible at this time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 18, 2021","Here’s Our Best Look Yet At Russia’s Secretive Space Cannon, The Only Gun Ever Fired In Space","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than four decades after the Soviet Union’s 23mm R-23M automatic cannon became the first and only gun to have actually been fired in space , at least that we know about, a new picture of this secretive weapon has emerged. The image offers the clearest look to date of the entire Shchit-1 self-defense system that armed the Almaz OPS-2 military space station, which orbited the Earth for around eight months between 1974 and 1975. Russian author Anatoly Zak, who also runs the website RussianSpaceWeb.com, spotted the Shchit-1 system in images the Russian Ministry of Defense released of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s visit to NPO Mashinostroyenia earlier in 2021. NPO Mashinostroyenia, originally known simply as OKB-52, is a design bureau best known for the development of missiles , rockets, and spacecraft, including work on the Almaz military space program during the Cold War. A screengrab from a TV Zvezda program that aired in 2015, showing the Shchit-1 self-defense system. Prior to this year, this was the most detailed look at the system and the R-23M cannon publicly available., TV Zvezda capture For years, the R-23M and the Almaz program were both wrapped in multiple layers of secrecy for various reasons. The fact that the OPS-2 space station was armed at all did not emerge until after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. There was only one available picture of the R-23M prior to 2015, and not a very good one , which may have only reflected a prototype design and did not show the complete Shchit-1 system. In 2015, a special aired on TV Zvezda , the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense, which included the first real look, seen above, of the entire space-based configuration . Development of the standard terrestrial R-23, designed primarily as self-defense weapons for bombers, began in the 1950s and was treated as a highly sensitive project. The brainchild of Aron Rikhter at KB Tochmash , a design bureau then headed up by Aleksandr Nudelman, the idea had been to craft a more compact gun that would be easier to fit inside an aircraft and particularly well-suited for turreted applications. Rikhter had worked directly with Nudelman on the earlier, unrelated 23mm NR-23 , as well as the larger 30mm NR-30 , both of which saw widespread use on Soviet aircraft. The Soviet Il-28 bomber had two NR-23 cannons mounted in the tail, as seen here., Varga Attila via Wikimedia The R-23 is a so-called revolver cannon, which, as its name indicates, feeds ammunition into the firing position by way of a number of revolver-like cylinders. This feed mechanism, which is similar in some very broad respects to Gatling-type designs , allows for a higher rate of fire than can be achieved with more conventional single-barrel guns. However, Rikhter’s gun, unlike most other revolver cannons, feeds ammunition from the magazine backward into the cylinders, rather than from the rear or the side. This places the feed mechanism in the center of the gun, helping to shorten its overall length. On top of that, the R-23 uses unique 23x260mm cartridges that have a so-called telescoped configuration. This means that the projectile is nestled completely inside the cartridge case, rather than sticking out of the front. The general concept behind ammunition of this type is to shorten the overall length of the round, and, by extension, the weapon that fires it, without any significant loss of performance over a gun firing a similar traditional round. The Tupolev Tu-22 Blinder bomber was the first aircraft to be designed to carry the R-23, with one of the guns to be mounted in a remote-controlled, radar-directed turret in the tail. Delays in the development of the cannon meant that the first Blinders entered service years before their tail guns were ready. The Tu-22’s tail gun, a turreted R-23 cannon., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia In the end, the Tu-22 was the only aircraft to be armed with the R-23. This helped keep the very existence of the gun largely secret until the first Blinders were exported to Iraq and Libya in the 1970s. An actual example did not reportedly fall into Western hands until one was recovered from the wreckage of a Libyan Tu-22 that French forces had shot down over Chad in 1987. That conflict between Chad and Libya, in general, was an intelligence bonanza for the West. It’s not clear whether or not the development of the R-23M for space-based applications contributed to the secrecy surrounding the weapon or if it was chosen because it was so closely guarded to start with. Its compact nature no doubt helped make it an obvious choice for attaching to a spacecraft, where weight and physical space are always at a premium. Based on the still limited information that has emerged to date, the Shchit-1 self-defense system consisted of a single R-23M cannon in a rigid mount with a magazine mounted on top of the center portion of the gun. What modifications may have been made to the weapon itself to ensure it would function properly in zero gravity are unclear. “From the dawn of the Space Age, the secrecy-obsessed Soviet military was terrified by the prospect of American spacecraft approaching and inspecting Soviet military satellites—which, according to the Kremlin’s propaganda, were not even supposed to exist,” Anatoly Zak wrote in a piece on the R-23M for Popular Mechanics in 2015. “This wasn’t crazy. The fear of attack on spacecraft was real, with both sides of the Iron Curtain developing anti-satellite weapons. It seemed perfectly logical in the 1960s that military and piloted spacecraft would need self-defense weapons.” The Almaz military space stations, work on which first began in the early 1960s, were intended to be armed from the beginning. Before shifting to the R-23M, Zak says that KB Tochmash had been working on a compact 14.5mm weapon for space-based use. The Almaz stations were expected to be multi-purpose military platforms in space. The plan was for the first types to be configured primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions with cameras and other sensors. Delays with the development of the sensor package held up the entire program. In 1971, the Soviet Union launched a civilian space station, Salyut , that incorporated some of the design work developed under the Almaz program, together with components from the venerable Soyuz spacecraft . A line drawing of the core Almaz space station design., NASA The Salyut program ultimately provided a cover for the Almaz space stations. Of the seven Salyut space stations launched between 1971 and 1991, three were actually military types. The first Almaz station, referred to publicly as Salyut-2 and also known as OPS-1, was launched in 1973. However, an accident on board shortly after launch forced the Soviets to abandon it before an actual crew could be sent up to join it. OPS-2, also called Salyut-3, followed in 1974. This station, armed with the R-23M, successfully reached orbit on June 25 of that year, but a two-man crew did not arrive until July. They remained there for 15 days, during which they tested the onboard telescopic Agat-1 Earth-observation camera, which is said to have been able to produce imagery of the ground with a resolution of better than three meters . A second crew failed to reach the station later in 1974 after their Soyuz spacecraft suffered a malfunction. The third mission to OPS-2 was subsequently canceled and it operated in an unmanned mode until it deorbited on January 24, 1975. In September 1974, personnel on the ground remotely ejected a pod with film from the Agat-1 camera, which subsequently returned to Earth and was recovered. A display depicting an Almaz space station., Pulux11 via Wikimedia The test of the R-23M cannon occurred on the station’s very last day in orbit. Without any way to fully simulate on the ground how firing the gun would impact OPS-2, the plan had always been to test it in orbit without anyone on board. The shock and recoil not only had the potential to damage the station but, in the vacuum of space, those forces raised the possibility that shooting the weapon could send it flying in a dangerously unpredictable fashion. “The outpost [OPS-2] ignited its jet thrusters simultaneously with firing the cannon to counteract the weapon’s powerful recoil,” Anatoly Zak explained in the story for Popular Mechanics back in 2015. “According to various sources, the cannon fired from one to three blasts [bursts], reportedly firing around 20 shells in all. They burned up in the atmosphere, too.” Exactly what happened during the test remains classified to this day. The next Almaz space station, known as OPS-3 and Salyut-5, had no weaponry on board, at least that we know of. Plans for an OPS-4 station included a new Shchit-2 self-defense system that was reportedly designed to fire missile-like interceptors , but no pictures of that weapon are known to exist publicly. The Soviets did also develop specialized self-defense guns for cosmonauts, such as the TP-82 seen in the video below, but these were intended to be used on Earth, not in space. You can read more about them in this past War Zone piece . How effective the Shchit-1 system would ever have been had it seen more widespread use is certainly debatable. The fixed mounting meant that the entire space station had to be rotated to aim it, which would reportedly have been done using a simple optical sight. In the years since the test of the R-23M in space, the prospect of attacks on satellites and other spacecraft certainly hasn’t gone away, nor has an interest in weapons that could be used in orbit for defensive or offensive purposes. Last year, the head of U.S. Space Force, the U.S. military’s newest branch, publicly accused Russia of having tested an on-orbit projectile-based anti-satellite weapon. It’s interesting to note that what little we know about the Shchit-2 system would seem to fit this general description. At the same time, Russia has also been testing relatively small inspector satellites, which have the ability to get very close to other objects in space. This could allow them to function as orbital spies, as well as “ killer satellites ,” using various means of attack to damage, disable, or destroy a target, including by simply smashing into it. An infographic from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency showing various means by which one satellite could attack another in space., DIA These kinds of threats have prompted discussion in other countries, including the United States and France, about the development of potential countermeasures, if they don’t exist already in the classified realm . The French military, specifically, says it is now working on space-based “guardian satellites” that will be armed with lasers , though it’s unclear if they will be powerful enough to physically damage or destroy an incoming threat or will just be designed as dazzlers to blind or confuse enemy sensor and seeker systems. The story of the R-23M certainly highlights just how complex and sensitive the matter of developing even the most basic weapons for space-based applications remains, a full 46 years after the Soviets conducted the one known test of an automatic cannon in orbit.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 28, 2021",Air Force F-35 Stealth Fighters Are Now Operating From Guam’s Austere Airfield,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time, the U.S. Air Force has introduced fifth-generation F-35A stealth fighters to its concept of austere airfield operations in the Pacific. The exercise took place on the island of Guam where the Joint Strike Fighters were joined by F-16s in operating from an austere airstrip at the northwest end of the island. The exercise was a major component of a larger emerging initiative that looks to provide dispersed operating locations that can be accessed by Air Force combat aircraft during a crisis. The new strategy is largely a result of the growing threat posed by ballistic missile attacks in the Pacific theater. At least four F-35As assigned to Eielson Air Force Base , Alaska, landed at Guam’s Northwest Field on February 16 as part of an Agile Combat Employment (ACE) exercise. The Eielson jets — which have deployed away from Alaska en-masse for the first time — are in the region to take part in the wider Cope North 21 maneuvers, which are taking place out of Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and also involve regional allies, including the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). An F-35A taxis during austere operations on Andersen AFB’s Northwest field., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jonathan Valdes Montijo After touching down at Northwest Field, the Lightning IIs participated in “hot pit” refueling, in which the jets were topped up at the austere base with their engines still running. As well as using R-11 fuel trucks, the F-35s were refueled by a C-130J transport aircraft assigned to the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan. According to an Air Force press release, “ACE is the new warfighting concept that Pacific Air Forces is operationalizing to ensure agility, deterrence, and resiliency in a contested or degraded environment.” Part of that planned resilience is finding alternative runway facilities in the Pacific region, bearing in mind that established bases could be wiped out by ballistic missiles — or by other means — during a conflict with China, for example. In any war with the United States, Andersen Air Force Base would surely be among China’s highest-priority targets. Indeed, a People’s Liberation Army Air Force recruitment video last year even showed bombers launching a mock attack on this base. An F-35A awaits to refuel from an R-11 fuel truck at Northwest Field., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jonathan Valdes Montijo Four F-35As sit at Northwest Field after participating in “hot pit” refueling., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jonathan Valdes Montijo As a result of Andersen’s vulnerability, the Air Force has been looking at alternative options, including forward bases at Wake Island and Tinian Island. Last month , The War Zone reported that Northwest Field would be hosting both F-35s from Eielson Air Force Base and F-16s from Misawa Air Base, during the annual Cope North exercise. Previously, the airfield had been limited to infrequent operations by C-130s and helicopters. A recent satellite image of Northwest Field on Guam., PHOTO © 2020 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION. The fact that Northwest Field has now been lengthened and equipped with an emergency arresting gear system is significant as if the fact it is now able to support the F-35, at least on a temporary basis. This aircraft, in particular, has highly specialist infrastructure and maintenance demands . For example, the jungle airstrip lacks even basic hangarage for the deployed aircraft, meaning any kind of maintenance work has to be carried out in the open air. It is notable that the U.S. Marine Corps is also starting to embrace austere operations for both its short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35Bs and its F-35C carrier-capable variants . In December last year, Marine F-35Cs demonstrated their expeditionary capabilities for the first time at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, in a series of maneuvers you can read all about here .

The concept has been tailored for the wider Pacific theater and is intended to make aircraft deployments more agile and less predictable, with small packages of aircraft flying from austere locations, and potentially moving on again quickly. All this is expected to boost survivability in case of hostilities with China, or another regional power. It also makes defending against U.S. and allied forces far more problematic.

It is very likely that Northwest Field will be used more regularly for austere operations drills like this and the fact the Air Force is now testing its latest fifth-generation fighters here is more evidence that the ACE concept will play an increasingly high-profile role in the Pacific theater in the future. Furthermore, going forward the remote airfield will offer a very useful alternative to the sprawling Andersen Air Force Base’s runways during a major crisis.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Take A Rare Look Inside Russia’s Doomsday Ballistic Missile Warning System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Ministry of Defense posted a video to its various social media channels yesterday showing some of the inside workings of one of the country’s early warning facilities that watch for incoming ballistic missiles. The video appears to show the Serpukhov-15 satellite control center in Kaluga Oblast, around 90 miles southwest of Moscow, which was at the center of one of the Cold War’s most hair-raising incidents. The video was posted online as Russia’s early warning network, designed to protect against ballistic missile attacks , celebrated its 50th anniversary. The organization that operates these systems, commonly referred to by its Russian acronym SPRN, marked the occasion in an appropriate style. The footage shows that it even apparently simulated an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attack from the United States. Operators at work within the early warning station, apparently Serpukhov-15., Youtube Screencap We also see the exterior of the sprawling facility, with its characteristic array of eight antennas under enormous geodesic domes. There is a brief view inside one of these radomes, revealing the rotating antenna itself, used for communication with early warning satellites. The video in question, seen below, shows critical information flash up onto a screen before the operators within the facility swing into action to start categorizing the object and confirming whether or not the launch is real. This is followed by a clip showing what appears to be an automatically generated map with the projected path of, in this case, the simulated missile as it hurtles toward Russian territory. According to the analysis of Dmitry Stefanovich, a Research Fellow at the Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS , the simulated attack sequence shown in the footage is based on a single ICBM being launched from the missile fields associated with F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. This base is home to the U.S. Air Force’s 90th Missile Wing, which is equipped with LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBMs. The job of the SPRN is not only to monitor for possible ICBM attacks but could help support a so-called “launch-on-warning” posture, wherein a nuclear retaliatory strike is initiated immediately when a likely threat is detected, rather than waiting for detonation to occur on Russian soil to conclusively confirm a suspect attack is real. There has been a debate over the years about whether or not the Kremlin actually has such a policy in place. The network would also be used to detect targets that Russia’s A-135 anti-ballistic missile system — known to NATO as the ABM-4 Gorgon — could then attempt to intercept. That system is designed to protect the Russian capital Moscow and its surrounding areas. The Missile Attack Warning System or Sistema preduprezhdeniya o raketnom napadenii (SPRN) became operational in what was then the Soviet Union on February 15, 1971. At that time, it consisted of a pair of Dnestr-M space surveillance and early warning radars located at Olenegorsk and Skrunda, plus a command post in Solnechnogorsk, located outside Moscow. As the space portion of the Russian early-warning system, the SPRN is the first echelon of this network, intended to detect the launch of an ICBM, while the second echelon consists of radars for over-the-horizon detection of ballistic missiles once they are on their flight paths. When ICBMs are launched, they create a telltale plume that can be observed by infrared sensors onboard satellites, at an altitude of around 25,000 miles above the surface of the Earth. A similar system exists in the United States, where Lockheed Martin is building three new missile warning satellites as part of the U.S. Air Force’s Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program, also called Next-Gen OPIR. This is part of a wider plan for an array of new space-based sensors to help guard against both advanced ballistic missiles and emerging hypersonic threats . A satellite image of the Serpukhov-15 satellite control center, as seen in the video., GOOGLE EARTH Once a satellite detects a launch, and its direction, this information is relayed to a ground control center where its reliability is assessed, followed by the automated warning: “Attention. Launch. First echelon.” At the same time, an alert signal is issued to the domestic missile defense system. “The early warning system was one of the first systems to perform the tasks of detecting possible attacks of ballistic missiles in a fully automatic mode,” the Russian Ministry of Defense explains. “During its years of duty, it went through several stages of modernization. This included more powerful radar stations and a space echelon, including special spacecraft and ground control centers.” Serpukhov-15 is one of two such centers, with a corresponding eastern satellite control center located near Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East. Between them, they receive information in real-time from early-warning satellites. The data is processed at the two centers and then transmitted to the command center at Solnechnogorsk. New Oko early-warning satellites began to be launched in 1972 and the initial constellation was commissioned into service in 1982. The last of these satellites was reportedly launched in 2010 and, since 2015, the more capable EKS Kupol satellites have begun to replace them. The Serpukhov-15 site, specifically, has continued to be upgraded, as well. It’s also interesting to note that Serpukhov-15 was also at the center of an incident in 1983 that apparently almost led to World War III. On September 26 of that year, a serious malfunction led to this satellite control center erroneously alerting officials to a launch of five Minuteman ICBMs in the United States. Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov , the officer on duty at the time, is credited with discounting the reports — which were not backed up by early warning radar — and preventing a potential nuclear conflict. Many years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, another incident saw a fire break out at Serpukhov-15, on May 10, 2001. “The fire destroyed one of the buildings and cables at the Serpukhov-15 control station, which led to a loss of communication with all four satellites in orbit,” according to an account by Pavel Podvig, an independent analyst who runs the Russian Nuclear Forces research project. As a result of the fire, control over all four of the station’s satellites was lost, although the center was back online by August 20 the same year. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the country’s missile attack warning systems detected more than 90 launches of foreign and domestic ballistic missiles and space rockets last year. Since the SPRN was introduced, the system has detected more than 2,000 launches of foreign and domestic ballistic missiles and approximately 1,000 launches of space rockets. The SPRN may not attract as much attention as the country’s ICBM forces , missile defenses , or anti-satellite systems , but it is a fundamental component of Russia’s strategic defenses. While the arsenals of strategic offensive weapons in Russia and the United States may be greatly reduced compared to their 1983 levels , they are still capable of catastrophic destruction, and infrastructure like Serpukhov-15 will continue to play a vital role in providing early warning of a ballistic missile attack.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 9, 2021",This Montage Of Bad U-2 Landings Shows How Hard It Is To Tame The Dragon Lady,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U-2 Dragon Lady remains a modern marvel well over six decades after it first flew. While it has grown massively in terms of flexibility, capability, and weight, one thing remains the same— it’s a bitch to land . To this day, the U-2 needs its own ground force of fast and specially-equipped chase cars driven by other Dragon Lady pilots who help talk down their comrades. The aircraft’s massive, glider-like wings make it want to keep flying, especially while in ground effect , and having two tandem sets of centerline wheels to land on—it releases its outrigger wheels on takeoff—only makes things more challenging, among a large number of other factors. Teaching new candidate pilots how to accomplish the task of getting the U-2 from wing-borne flight to safely on the runway, in one piece, is clearly its own art in of itself. While we have seen a rough U-2 landing before, footage of these clumsy affairs is still rare. That’s why we were grinning ear-to-ear when we saw a video on Instagram posted by an incredible photographer and a guy who spent nearly a decade and a half years flying U-2s, Ross Franquemont, better known by his online persona, Extreme Ross . The video is part of an awesome two-part post about what it takes to become a Dragon Lady driver. Historically speaking, it is an elite and relatively tiny group. The U-2 remains a physically and mentally demanding aircraft to master beyond its landing characteristics, although the landings certainly make for the most exciting video montages. As you can see, bouncing, swerving, wing dragging, and porpoising are all in the student Dragon Lady tamer’s repertoire: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ross Franquemont (@extremeross) And the view from the cockpit of the Dragon Lady on approach in the hands of a master: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ross Franquemont (@extremeross) Beyond the killer video clips, the experienced U-2 driver gives us a great firsthand account of what it takes to become a U-2 pilot: “How does someone become a U-2 pilot?” To begin with, nobody is forced to be a U-2 pilot. It is one of the few airframes in the military which is 100% flown by volunteers (yes I know that just being in the military is a volunteer service but you get the idea). Every single U-2 pilot had to put in the work to apply, study, interview, fly their ass off, and ultimately get accepted into the community. To start with, the U-2 takes applicants from virtually any airframe, in (almost) any service. Anybody can google U-2 pilot application and get the most recent requirements. If you put in an application, the U-2 recruiter, along with all the other pilots, will vet the applicants, and choose the ones that we felt would be a good fit. Then comes the interview…Most people dread interviews, especially if they last a few hours. The U-2 interview is 2 weeks. Interviewees travel to Beale for a fun filled 2 week paid vacation. A vacation that culminates in 3 of the most brutal flights you’ve ever been put through. The first week involves some of the formal interviews with the U-2 leadership. You get to wear your dress uniform and stand out like a sore thumb as you walk around and have others gawk. You do lots of mobile rides and do some medical tests. Then there’s the dreaded “claustrophobia check”. A suit technician suits you up in a space suit and teaches you how to eat and drink while you sit in it for a couple hours. It’s really to gauge how you respond to the space suit. At the end of week 1, if you haven’t gotten yourself kicked off the island, you meet your assigned instructor pilot who’s going to guide you through the ball buster Acceptance Flights. The goal of the acceptance flights is simple, can we teach you to do what is done in this video, in the extremely short time we have you. It’s a steep learning curve but those that rise to the challenge, are offered a slot among the community. Tune in next time to learn a little more about these flights and see some examples when things go wrong. … “How does someone become a U-2 pilot?” Part 2 Last post I talked a bit about the process someone goes through to get to their U-2 interview and eventually up to their three Acceptance Flights (we shorten them to AF-1, AF-2, & AF-3) There is a small group of instructors inside the U-2 training squadron, 1st RS, who take on the role of AF Instructors. It is a separate upgrade for instructors and at any given time, there are only 4-6 AF instructors in the world. Each interview always uses 2 AF qualified instructors, one is the primary and the other the mobile instructor. The Friday of the first week, the primary instructor takes the interviewee for the entire day and goes through various training to prepare for the first flight. There’s cockpit familiarization, hours of powerpoint, hours of white board instruction, watching videos, using the cockpit procedures training, and doing everything possible to mentally prepare the interviewee. Morning of flight, the primary instructor, the interviewee, and the mobile instructor brief and then head out to the plane. Physiological support technicians help the interviewee get into his seat. They take the rear seat in the two-seater TU-2S because some essential systems can only be manipulated from the front seat. I think I can speak for every U-2 pilot when I say that the experience of the first takeoff on AF-1, which is flown by the instructor, is one of the most memorable experiences in your life. Shortly after that is the terror of the first landing. It’s just as terrifying for the instructor (been there). No matter how many hours of flying you have, you have never experienced anything like the Dragon Lady. The primary instructor spends AF-1 and 2 pushing the student to pick up the landings. Each flight tests mental and physical endurance (just physically flying almost 50 touch and goes is demanding). On AF-3, the primary and mobile instructor switch seats and see what the student has learned. The flights aren’t pretty, but we do get an idea if they are going to be able to pick it up. After some deliberation, an interviewee we agree to accept will be granted a position in the community. So yeah, it’s not exactly like signing up to take the kids on a field trip. The U-2 family at Beale Air Force Base in California truly puts U-2 pilot candidates through a hands-on crucible to make sure they are getting the quality of pilot the aircraft absolutely demands. And it’s clearly a wild ride learning to ride the Dragon. A huge thanks to Extreme Ross for sharing these videos and his expertise.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2021","Contractor For U.S.-Led Coalition Dead, U.S. Serviceperson Injured After Rocket Attack In Iraq (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq says that a civilian contractor supporting its operations was killed in a rocket attack on a section that its forces operate from at Erbil Airport in Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region. A U.S. servicemember and five other contractors were also injured in the incident.bega U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, the chief spokesperson for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), the official name of the U.S.-led coalition that is ostensibly fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, confirmed the casualties in a Tweet on Feb. 15, 2021. A screengrab from a video reportedly showing a fire following a rocket attack on Erbil Airport in Iraq on Feb. 15, 2021., via Twitter Videos that emerged on social media after the attack began showed what appeared to be a large fire at the airport, but the extent of the damage is unclear at this time. It’s also not clear if U.S. Centurion Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) systems, or any other defenses, were employed in an attempt to knock down any of the incoming projectiles. An Iranian-backed militant group Saraya Awliya Al Dam, or the Avengers of Blood Companies, has already claimed responsibility for the attack on Erbil Airport, which was reportedly just one a number of sites hit by rockets tonight. There are unconfirmed reports that the Chinese consulate in Erbil was also hit, among other sites, with a local security guard being injured. Though Saraya Awliya Al Dam said its primary target tonight was the “U.S. military base” in Erbil, it also threatened more attacks on Iraqi Kurdistan and the incident comes amid a number of geopolitical crises in the country. The rockets notably began to fall an hour after another Iranian-backed group, Ashab Al Kahf, had issued a statement threatening attacks on Erbil, as well as other locations in northern Iraq. That threat comes a complex situation developing in northern Iraq, where a Turkish intervention has prompted the anger of certain Iraqi groups, including Ashab Al Kahf, over violating of the country’s sovereignty. However, that intervention is targeting the Kurdish Workers’ Party, a Kurdish militant group better known by the acronym PKK, which has also sparred with Iranian-backed militias in the past. The PKK recently executed 13 Turkish nationals it had been holding hostage, reportedly including military personnel and intelligence operatives . Their bodies were discovered after Turkey launched a new campaign against the Kurdish group last week. At the same time, relations between authorities in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) have been strained in recent years. Though unconfirmed, Kurdish officials in Iraq reportedly said that the rockets had been fired from locations in Kirkuk province, which the KRG ceded to the country’s central authorities after fighting in 2017 . The KRG has also been an important long-time U.S. partner in Iraq. Beyond that, Saraya Awliya Al Dam and Ashab Al Kahf have stepped up operations , as have a host of other Iranian-backed groups, targeting the U.S. coalition in the last six months or so. This is all ostensibly in retaliation for the U.S. military’s killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani outside of Baghdad International Airport in January 2020. At the time, Soleimani was head of the Quds Force, the arm of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) charged with coordinating activities with foreign proxies and otherwise conducting external operations. In the lead up to the first anniversary of Soleimani’s death, and immediately afterward, Iranian officials and Iranian proxies around the Middle East, especially in Iraq, issued numerous public threats , including directly against former President Donald Trump . Targeting the areas of Erbil Airport that host U.S.-led coalition forces would be well in line with these groups’ calls for vengeance . All of this also comes as U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is seeking some kind of rapprochement with Iran, including a restoration of a controversial deal over that country’s nuclear programs. The Trump administration pulled out of that multi-national agreement in 2018 and Iran has been steadily violating more and more of its terms in an apparent attempt to force concessions from the remaining parties, especially the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, as well as the United States. Biden has said he will not offer any kind of sanctions relief to Iranian authorities until they return to full compliance with the so-called Iran Deal. No matter what, the death of a contractor employed by the U.S.-led coalition, as well as the other coalition injuries, could, at best, complicate these diplomatic efforts. Iranian-backed militias killing a coalition contractor in late 2019 precipitated a series of events that culminated in the killing of Qassem Soleimani and Iran launching unprecedented ballistic missile strikes at bases housing American troops in Iraq, including Erbil Airport, in retaliation. Those missile strikes caused more than 100 American casualties, most involving traumatic brain injuries . Rocket attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq, of course, are not uncommon and the U.S. has retaliated against Iranian-backed militias since January 2020 without nearly the same repercussions. It remains to be seen how the Biden administration will respond to this latest deadly attack in Iraq. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 7:50 PM EST The U.S.-led coalition and other U.S. officials have said that the contractor who died in this rocket attack was not Iraqi and was also not a U.S. citizen, but has yet to release any additional details. KRG authorities have also released pictures of what appear to be launchers for 107mm rockets, concealed inside a civilian vehicle, which were used to carry out this attack. There are still some rockets in the launch tubes, indicating that some of them did not function as intended. A total of 14 rockets were reportedly fired at Erbil. UPDATE: 10:10 PM EST U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has issued the following statement: We are outraged by today’s rocket attack in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Initial reports indicate that the attacks killed one civilian contractor and injured several members of the Coalition, including one American service member and several American contractors. We express our condolences to the loved ones of the civilian contractor killed in this attack, and to the innocent Iraqi people and their families who are suffering these ruthless acts of violence. I have reached out to Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani to discuss the incident and to pledge our support for all efforts to investigate and hold accountable those responsible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",This Marine One VH-60N Had Its Iconic Paint Job Blotted Out For Historic Afghanistan Trip,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just last week, The War Zone wrote about the lone “green top” UH-60N helicopter assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One, which is better known for its “white top” VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns that shuttle the president, their family, and their closest advisors around where ever they might need to go. After publishing that piece, we were alerted to another unusual picture, this one showing what could be best described as a “green-washed” VH-60N from President George W. Bush’s historic visit to Afghanistan in 2006, just in time for President’s Day. Aviation photographer Stephan de Bruijn grabbed a picture of the VH-60N , seen at the top of this story, as it flew over Afghanistan’s capital Kabul on March 1, 2006, and kindly shared it with us. The helicopter’s muted overall green paint job is nevertheless eye-catching given its contrast to the usual high-visibility white-and-green scheme these helicopters, as well as the rest of Marine Helicopter Squadron One’s (HMX-1) white top fleets , typically wear. The over-painting is clearly temporary, too, as parts of the standard paint scheme can be seen underneath. A VH-60N in its standard paint scheme in Davos, Switzerland, supporting President Donald Trump participation in the 2018 World Economic Forum., AP We at The War Zone are unaware of any other pictures showing VH-60Ns anywhere with this kind of temporary paintwork. It was almost certainly done to help conceal that the helicopter that was carrying President Bush and his entourage by trying to make it look more like a standard U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk . The countermeasures dispenser underneath its right-side engine exhaust is also loaded with decoy flares, something that is not commonly seen in pictures of VH-60Ns in lower-threat environments. The flares would help protect against heat-seeking missiles, including shoulder-fired types also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems , or MANPADS. This particular helicopter also has two AN/ALQ-144 infrared jammers, also known as “disco balls,” above and below the fuselage, which provide additional defense against these types of threats. In the years since this picture was taken, those have been replaced by directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) systems, which you can read more about in these past War Zone pieces . A close up of some of the “green-washed” VH-60N’s defensive systems, including the fully-loaded flare bucket under the engine exhaust and the two “disco balls,” one prominently visible on top of the fuselage and the other seen underneath at the lower right-hand corner. , Stephan de Bruijn via AirHistory.net De Bruijn said that this helicopter subsequently landed at a heliport that the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operated at the time situated near the U.S. Embassy. Construction on what was then a nearly brand-new American Embassy compound in Kabul had only been completed earlier that year. President Bush cut a ceremonial ribbon to officially open it during his visit, though U.S. diplomatic personnel had already started working there at that point. De Bruijn says that additional UH-60 Black Hawks , as well as CH-47 and MH-47 Chinook helicopters, also supported the President’s trip. A number of these helicopters were assigned to elements of the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) that were deployed to the country at the time. “Overhead was an AC-130 and a flight of A-10s gave Close Air Support while F-16s gave top cover,” he added in the description accompanying a copy of the photo on AirHistory.net . “Quite an operation!” It’s not surprising at all that every possible security precaution was taken during this trip, which marked the first time Bush had been to Afghanistan since U.S.-led intervention in the country had begun in late 2001 very shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It was also the first time any U.S. President had set foot in the country since Dwight D. Eisenhower had traveled there in 1959. Bush’s trip had been planned two months in advance under the strictest secrecy, with members of the traveling Press Pool only being alerted as to their actual destination when Air Force One stopped at Shannon Airport in Ireland to refuel. The stopover in Afghanistan was part of a larger trip that took the President to India and Pakistan, as well. It’s not all clear how often HMX-1 has used this “green-washing” technique to obscure its white top helicopters during deployments to higher-risk locations. As already noted, we’re unaware of any other pictures showing this practice. We also do know that VH-60Ns, specifically, have flown in their standard scheme in more dangerous locales, including in support of President H.W. Bush’s visit to Somalia between Dec. 31 and Jan. 2, 1993. A member of the US military stands guard in front of a VH-60N helicopter at Mogadishu Airport in Somalia during President George H.W. Bush’s visit to the country in December 1992-January 1993., DOD The security surrounding visits by the President , as well as other senior U.S. officials, to Afghanistan, is still extremely high, and for good reason , even after nearly two decades of fighting. As such, helicopters remain a primary mode of transportation for U.S. personnel in much of the country, even for diplomatic staff just making the short hop from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul to the U.S. Embassy compound, flights that take around five minutes, as you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Regardless, HMX-1’s days of flying any H-60 variants, no matter how green their paint scheme might be, are coming closer and closer to an end. The squadron’s VH-60Ns, along with its VH-3Ds, are set to be replaced by new VH-92As in the next few years. The UH-60N, which serves primarily as a trainer for the VH-60Ns, is set to follow those helicopters into retirement. By the next President’s Day, the VH-92As should be much more prevalent in HMX-1’s day-to-day operations. We’ll have to keep an eye out to see if any of them get “green-washed” when they start heading overseas.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",All You Need To Know About Italy’s F-35 Carrier That Just Arrived In The US,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following its Atlantic crossing, the aircraft carrier Cavour , the flagship of the Italian Navy, will conduct its first trials with the F-35B Lightning II stealth fighter . Italy will become the third nation to begin flying the fifth-generation aircraft from an aircraft carrier. The Cavour entered the Chesapeake Bay on February 13 and docked at Norfolk, Virginia, the homeport of the U.S. Navy’s 2nd Fleet. Trials of the short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B from the warship’s deck are due to begin shortly in close cooperation with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. After demonstrating safe launch and recovery of the jets, the end result should be the declaration that the F-35B is “ready for operations” aboard the Cavour. Eventually, it will begin flight deck workups with Itay’s domestically-based F-35Bs. An aerial view of the Italian Navy’s aircraft carrier Cavour . The AV-8B+ Harrier II jump jets seen at the rear of the flight deck are slated to be replaced by new F-35B Joint Strike Fighters., Italian Ministry of Defense Cavour ’s trials with the Joint Strike Fighters are set to similar to those that the British Royal Navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth conducted in 2018. The carrier will sail in the Western Atlantic, where it will be joined by U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs from the Integrated Test Force (ITF) based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. Since this is the first time that any of the stealth jets have embarked on the Italian carrier, the team will have to prove the aircraft can be operated safely, expanding the envelope and ensuring that the warship and its facilities are fully compatible with them. “Operating in the Western Atlantic with our NATO allies presents a mutually beneficial opportunity to enhance both of our navies’ capabilities,” explained Navy Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis, commander of the 2nd Fleet. “Supporting our Italian allies in the certification of their aircraft carrier increases our collective experience in safety and combat abilities. We are stronger together.” This cooperation actually began while the Cavour was in transit to the United States, when it was met by the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Stout (DDG 55) and then spent three days on maneuvers in the Atlantic. The Italian vessel worked with F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets from Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 7, and P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing 11. “Specific events included integrated ship maneuvering, low-slow-flyer detect-to-engage, anti-surface warfare serials with P-8 participation, air defense/air intercept control event with F/A-18 participation, and C5I [command, control, communications, computers, combat systems, and intelligence] interoperability events,” according to a statement from the U.S. Navy. On its arrival in Norfolk, the Cavour was “hosted” by the Nimitz class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). This means the U.S. carrier’s crew will be responsible for the various services required by the Italian warship, including refueling, security, medical functions, as well as loading equipment and personnel. U.S. sailors, assigned to the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stenni s, prepare to bring the Italian Navy aircraft carrier Cavour , into port as it arrives at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, February 13, 2021., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Curtis Burdick “We couldn’t be more excited to host our Italian ally,” said Captain Cassidy Norman, commanding officer of the Stennis . “The Stennis team fully understands the importance of building trust and cooperation by supporting Cavour ’s certification with the newest multirole combat aircraft, the F-35. We are happy to see our Italian naval aviation counterparts dramatically increase their operational capability, strengthening our collective capability.” A test pilot with Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 23 (VX-23), conducts training in an F-35B from the F-35 Patuxent River Integrated Test Force at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, on January 27, 2021., Kyra Helwick/U.S. Navy The F-35B trials aboard the Cavour will involve test pilots and flight-test engineers from the ITF at Patuxent River and two specially instrumented developmental flight test aircraft will be embarked on the ship. This suggests that the Italian Navy will not be using any of its own F-35Bs in the trials. The first two Italian Navy F-35Bs, also known as BL-1 and BL-2, both of which were manufactured on the Italian assembly line at Cameri, are currently at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, for crew training. “We are excited to get underway with the sailors of Cavour and honored to contribute to the aircraft carrier achieving the Italian Navy’s strategic goal of it being ‘Ready for Operations,’” said Andrew Maack, F-35 Pax River ITF chief test engineer, and site director. “We look forward to a phenomenally successful shipboard detachment.” Proving out the F-35B for service aboard the Cavour is a fundamental part of an overhaul of the Italian Navy’s carrier capabilities. The carrier itself has been in service since 2009 and was ordered as a much more capable successor to the Giuseppe Garibaldi , which was introduced in 1985 as a “helicopter cruiser.” It was subsequently redesignated as an “aircraft-carrying cruiser” in 1989 and AV-8B Harrier IIs were added to its air wing. The Giuseppe Garibaldi underway in the Mediterranean., NATO/PUBLIC DOMAIN In contrast to its predecessor, the Cavour was intended to embark fixed-wing aircraft from the outset, with these initially being the Italian Navy’s upgraded AV-8B+ jets. After Cavour became the Italian Navy’s new flagship in 2011, Giuseppe Garibaldi was reassigned for amphibious operations, with expanded command and control facilities. An AV-8B+ launches from the Cavour . , Italian Ministry of Defense Cavour ’s displacement of 26,700 long tons is almost three times greater than Giuseppe Garibaldi and it normally embarks a crew of around 1,200, of which approximately 200 are assigned to the air group. The Cavour ’s 720-foot flight deck has a “ski jump” takeoff ramp angled at 12 degrees and the carrier can accommodate a maximum of 36 aircraft, normally a mix of AV-8B+ jets and AW101 or NH90 helicopters ; 24 aircraft can be parked on deck at any one time and 12 can be stowed in the hangar below the deck. Italian Army rotary-wing assets, including the Mangusta attack helicopter and the CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift transport, can also be embarked if required. A total air wing of between 20 and 22 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters is typically embarked. In due course, the Harriers will be replaced by F-35Bs, 30 of which are on order, to be divided equally between the Italian Navy and the Italian Air Force. Compared to the Harriers, the F-35B will offer significantly greater overall fixed-wing strike capability and present a future in which the Italian Navy could have a much greater role to play in NATO maritime operations. It also opens up the possibility of closer cooperation between the Italian Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps, perhaps mirroring the situation with the Royal Navy, where a Marine Corps F-35B squadron will be embedded in the air wing during the first operational cruise for the HMS Queen Elizabeth . The propulsion system is of the combined gas turbine and gas turbine (COGAG) type, with four General Electric/Avio LM-2500 gas turbines producing around 118,000 horsepower connected to a pair of propeller shafts. There are also six Wartsila diesel generators for energy production. The maximum speed is 29 knots, with a maximum range of 7,000 nautical miles at 16 knots. Typical endurance is around 18 days before the warship needs to be refueled. The Cavour , with examples of the AV-8B+, AW101, and AB212 on deck., Italian Ministry of Defense The Cavour is notably well-defended, with four eight-tube Sylver launchers for the MBDA Aster 15 surface-to-air missile providing air defense out to a range of at least 18 miles, a pair of OTO Melara 76mm dual-purpose guns, plus three Oerlikon Contraves 25mm anti-aircraft guns. As well as being the navy’s flagship, serving as a command post and able to deploy its air wing for offensive and defensive operations, Cavour is designed for use as an amphibious warfare vessel and for a variety of humanitarian missions, being able to embark vehicles and a hospital. In fact, the carrier’s first operational deployment was a humanitarian relief mission, in response to the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010. A first combat mission took place the following year, during Operation Unified Protector, the NATO intervention in the Libyan Civil War. As a flagship, the Cavour has headed up Operation Sophia, the European Union mission that aimed to neutralize refugee smuggling routes in the Mediterranean. The Cavour , front, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), and the French Navy aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , conduct operations in the Gulf of Oman., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Ethan M. Schumacher/ As an amphibious warfare flagship, Cavour can form the centerpiece of a capable task force, together with one or more of the Italian Navy’s amphibious assault ships, the San Giusto , San Giorgio , and San Marco . All three of these can embark and disembark landing craft and vehicles via a bow door and floodable well deck at the stern. These amphibious assault ships can also accommodate helicopters, but not fixed-wing aircraft. However, in the future, the F-35Bs will also operate from another fixed-wing-capable Italian warship, the Trieste . This is a landing helicopter dock that will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and is expected to enter service next year. With a fully loaded displacement of 32,000 long tons, the new warship will be bigger than the Cavour and will combine facilities for fixed-wing and rotary-wing aviation with more comprehensive amphibious capabilities: a floodable well-deck, landing craft including LCAC types , and the ability to carry Ariete main battle tanks , Centauro tank destroyers , and up to 600 soldiers. Clearly, the F-35B will be a significant capability for both the Cavour and Trieste , but Italy’s procurement of the STOVL version of the Joint Strike Fighter has not been without controversy. At one stage, the Italian Navy expected to acquire 22 of the STOVL jet fighters, before this was trimmed to 15 in a 2012 spending review. Of these, three will remain in the United States for training, while the other 12 will be based in Italy, co-located with the Italian Air Force’s own fleet of 15 F-35Bs, expected to result in significant savings in terms of training, maintenance, and logistics. The basing decision has not yet been made , but a likely option is Amendola Air Base, home of the Italian Air Force’s first F-35A wing. All the Italian F-35Bs will be assembled locally at Cameri. An Italian Air Force F-35A rolls for takeoff while a German Luftwaffe Tornado awaits its turn., Italian Ministry of Defense Plans call for Italy’s F-35B to achieve initial operational capability by 2023, leading to a phased withdrawal of the Harriers by 2024-25. Meanwhile, the third Italian F-35B was delivered to the Italian Air Force early last year and the service has its own plans to use the STOVL version for land-based operations, in addition to the 60 F-35As it plans to procure. In particular, the air force is eyeing the F-35B’s suitability for the kinds of expeditionary missions that the U.S. Marine Corps has been busy pioneering , using both F-35Bs and F-35Cs. Co-location of the Italian F-35B fleet threatens to result in cuts to the navy’s infrastructure. Should Amendola be chosen as the joint operating location, it would likely lead to the closure of the Italian Navy’s Grottaglie Air Base. This is located somewhat closer to the port of Taranto, which will eventually be home to the Cavour and Trieste . Today, Grottaglie is home to the Harriers and a single helicopter squadron, but with two other rotary-wing bases also active, that unit could likely be relocated in the future. The then Italian Minister of Defense, Roberta Pinotti, visits Grottaglie Air Base in 2015., Italian Ministry of Defense While a similar model is being pursued with the British F-35B fleet , with both Royal Air Force and Royal Navy squadrons to be based at RAF Marham, there is a concern in Italy that it could lead to the air force taking the lead in Joint Strike Fighter operations, to the potential detriment of carrier-based aviation. Some within the Italian Navy, as well as at least one former admiral , had made calls for the entire F-35B fleet to be transferred to their control. With just 12 jets potentially available to the Italian Navy in-country at any one time, they argue, it will be difficult to generate enough available airframes to support a meaningful carrier deployment. That is, of course, unless the air force provides its own aircraft for such missions, as is planned for the British F-35B fleet. Regardless of how many Italian F-35Bs are eventually made available to its expanding carrier force, and which service they are operated by, the latest developments confirm the fighter’s importance to the country’s maritime ambitions. As the Italian Ambassador to the United States, Armando Varricchio, observed, the arrival of the carrier in Norfolk also “symbolizes the strong relationship between Italy and the United States and our transatlantic bond, which is imperative for the security of both nations and peace-making at large.” Contact the author: thomas@thedrive.com Thomas Newdick Staff Writer Air Air Forces F-35 Fighters"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking to divest its nearly-new Mk VI patrol boats , the oldest of which are just six years old, and has already begun laying the groundwork to do so. Barring an order to change course from President Joe Biden’s administration or intervention by Congress, the service plans to remove all 12 of these boats, examples of which are based in Guam , as well as in the continental United States, and forward-deployed in the Persian Gulf , from service before the end of the year. An unclassified General Administration (GENADMIN) message that The War Zone reviewed said that the Navy is presently looking to get rid of the Mk VIs by the end of the 2021 Fiscal Year, or September 30 of this year. The GENADMIN came from the office of Vice Admiral James Kilby, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities, also known as N9, and is dated February 5, 2021. A source familiar with the state of the program says that Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), to which all of these patrol boats are presently assigned, could begin retiring them as early as next month. A pair of Mk VI patrol boats from the detachment in Guam visit Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2019., USN The GENADMIN says that the plans for the Mk VIs are “in accordance with approved budgetary decisions.” The message also says “this plan will be adjusted if necessary based on subsequent execution year decisions made by leadership or as required by Congressional action.” When contacted, the Navy would not confirm or deny any plans to divest the Mk IVs or any timeline for doing so. The service did confirm, indirectly, that a proposed decision regarding the future of these boats was part of the upcoming President’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2022, or PB22. A public version of the annual budget request from the Executive Branch to Congress is typically released in February. “The PB22 budget request is pre-decisional,” Navy Lieutenant Rob Reinheimer, a spokesperson for the service, told The War Zone . “We will not comment on future budgetary decisions until the budget request is submitted to Congress later this year.” There have already been indications that the Navy might be leaning toward getting rid of the Mk VIs. During a talk as part of the Surface Navy Association’s 2021 Virtual Symposium in January, U.S. Marine Corps Major General Tracy King, the head of the Expeditionary Warfare division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, had said that Vice Admiral Kilby was in the process of making a new determination about what the service’s actual requirements were for these patrol boats ahead of the 2022 Fiscal Year budget request. “In wargaming scenarios against peer nations [such as Russia or China], the Mk VIs were deemed not really needed (given their small size and limited missile firepower),” King added, according to Naval News . The boats are “very expensive to maintain,” the Marine Major General continued. In that same talk, Navy Rear Admiral Paul Schlise, the director of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations’ Surface Warfare division, did confirm that the service is planning to supplant its Cyclone class patrol craft, which are larger than the Mk VIs, with a combination of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) and U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats . There is no plan to buy additional ships of any kind to directly replace the Cyclones , though, which means the service is set to lose the added patrol capacity they offer now, as well. As of February 12, 2012, the Navy was looking to decommission three of its 13 Cyclones by the end of March, with the USS Shamal and the USS Zephyr destined to be scrapped and the USS Tornado to be made available for transfer to a foreign ally or partner. All told, the future of these kinds of smaller combat vessels in the Navy, outside the service’s special warfare community, seems to be very much in flux. The US Navy’s Cyclone class patrol craft USS Monsoon , at rear, sails alongside the U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat USCGC Wrangell , in the Persian Gulf., USN Still, getting rid of the Mk VIs, which are, by all metrics, very young, would seem to be an, at best, controversial decision. The Navy only ordered the 12 patrol boats from SAFE Boats International (SBI), at an average price of between $7 and $8 million each, between 2012 and 2015. NECC took delivery of them between 2015 and 2017. Despite initial plans to acquire a total of 48 Mk VIs, and repeated public statements about the need for additional examples , there have been no additional purchases in the past six years. Since then, the projected unit costs of new Mk VIs have also fluctuated between $14 million and $16 million . The 85-foot-long Mk VIs, which displace around 72 tons, have a main armament of two M242 Bushmaster cannons, the same gun found on the U.S. Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicles , in a pair of remotely-operated Mk 38 Mod 0 mounts, one on the bow and one at the stern. They also have two smaller remote weapon stations, each armed with a .50 caliber M2 machine gun, one on top of the front of the pilothouse and one on the superstructure behind it. Four additional weapon mounts are provided at various positions around the ship, which can be fitted with different types of machine guns or automatic grenade launchers. A Mk VI patrol boat., USN The Mk VIs can get up to speeds of 45 knots and they have impressive endurance for boats of their size, too. They are able to sail up 750 nautical miles at a cruise speed of 25 knots without refueling. They also have a very robust communications and sensor suite for boats of their type and its mission systems have an open-architecture design . This was done specifically to make it easier to integrate new and improved capabilities over time. “The primary mission of Mark VI Patrol Boats is to provide [the] capability to persistently patrol littoral areas beyond sheltered harbors and bays for the purpose of force protection of friendly and coalition forces and critical infrastructure,” according to the Navy . The boats are also designed to be readily reconfigurable to support a wider array of mission sets, including medical evacuation, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief , explosive ordnance disposal , and special operations forces support. In the last role, they would supplement a small fleet of dedicated special operations boats that the Navy’s special warfare community operates, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone story . The Navy also acquired a one-off Command and Control Boat Mk VI, which featured a more robust communications and data-sharing suite, experimenting with it for a number of years before removing it from service. There is enough space on the standard Mk VIs to employ hand-launched drones and small unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Sailors launch an RQ-20 Puma drone from the top of a Mk VI patrol boat., USN Sailors on board a Mk VI patrol boat work with a small unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV)., USN Acts of maritime terrorism, notably the bombing of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Cole in the Port of Aden in Yemen in 2000, together with the experiences from the early years of the War On Terror, especially operations in littoral areas in and around Iraq , were major factors that eventually led to the Mk VI program. The boats were expected to replace an array of smaller watercraft that had been acquired in the 2000s to meet various maritime force protection and other requirements. A U.S. Navy Small Unit Riverine Craft (SURC), in front, and a Riverine Command Boat (RCB), at rear, train in Virginia in 2011. These were among the types of smaller patrol boats that the Navy acquired in the 2000s. , USN It’s certainly true then that the Navy’s original requirements for the Mk VIs were not based on the kind of higher-end conflicts that the U.S. military, as a whole, has been shifting its focus to in recent years. At the same time, though, the prospect of smaller conflicts and skirmishes with various potential adversaries remains a very real possibility. Iran, in particular, has spent considerable time and resources developing a significant number of small watercraft and semi-submersibles armed with various weapons, including naval mines , to be used in swarming attacks on larger, higher-value enemy warships, such as aircraft carriers . This is a threat other countries beyond Iran could employ, as well, and the Mk VI’s capabilities slot very well into a multi-layered approach to countering it. Similarly, they present a valuable tool for defending against manned and unmanned explosive-laden suicide boats , as well as armed divers , which could also be used in individual terrorist attacks or as part of a larger maritime swarm. The missions that the Mk VIs are designed to carry out are not absent in higher-end conflicts, either. Major General King’s comments about the boats’ limited utility due to their “small size and limited missile firepower” would seem to reflect a very narrow view of what roles they could fill in a major fight. Swarming boat attacks, including those involving autonomous unmanned watercraft , could easily be components of larger-scale war. Beyond that, there are options available right now to increase their conventional firepower that could expand their capabilities against more traditional opponents. For instance, Lockheed Martin offers a miniature vertical launch system for its AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), called the JAGM Quad Launcher (JQL), and has proposed it already for the Navy’s Mk VIs. You can read more about JAGM and the JQL in this past War Zone piece . A graphic from a Lockheed Martin brochure for the JAGM Quad Launcher (JQL) showing, among others, a proposed configuration for the Mk VI patrol boat., Lockheed Martin NECC has also suggested in the past the Mk VIs could be used in swarms against larger enemy vessels, themselves. Smaller missiles, such as the AGM-179A, would not be able to sink, or even severely damage, a larger surface combatant, but could potentially be used to destroy key systems, such as radars, to effect a mission kill that could effectively put the target vessel out of commission for a protracted period of time. “Our missions were in more permissive environments, and a lot of our training was tailored toward that,” Navy Senior Chief Derrick Cox, responsible for training Mk VI crews as part of Coastal Riverine Squadron 2’s Training Evaluation Unit, had told Defense News back in 2019. “Now we are geared toward non-permissive environments.” There are certainly questions about how effective or survivable Mk VIs would be in this role and Marine Corps Major General King’s comments last month certainly suggested that wargames have indicated that the boats are too vulnerable for any such operations. However, in the past, the service has made clear that an expectation of potential casualties has been part of routine discussions about their employment in any future conflict. “A lot of times when we talk to the units and the squadrons before they deploy we tell them that you have to be ready to expect that not all of you might come home,” now-retired Navy Rear Admiral Brian Brakke also told Defense News in 2019, when he was head of NECC. “And that focuses them that this isn’t just something where we’re going over to just ride around: We’re ready to fight and win our nation’s wars if we have to.” A Mk VI patrol boat off the coast of Guam., USN No matter what, in a major conflict, smaller patrol boats would still offer a cost-effective way to conduct valuable presence patrols or support other important missions, such as mine-clearing , in lower-threat areas to help free up larger warships for higher-risk missions. “Where I would like to go [with the Mk IVs] is where do we have the opportunity inside the littorals to be able to conduct missions for the Navy that may free up capital assets to go do other missions,” Rear Admiral Brakke added in 2019. At that time the command was actively exploring how the patrol boats would fit into future operations against “great power competitors,” such as China and Russia. From the beginning of the program, the Navy has also touted the ability of well deck-equipped amphibious warfare ships to carry large numbers of Mk VIs, making it easier to deploy and then rapidly reposition them across long distances. Amphibious warfare vessels could also serve as motherships for the patrol boats in remote or austere areas where there is limited infrastructure or locations where existing infrastructure has been destroyed or is otherwise unavailable. A briefing slide showing how many Mk VIs might be able to fit inside the well decks of various Navy amphibious warfare ships., USN A Mk VI patrol boat sails toward the well deck of the Whidbey Island class dock landing ship USS Comstock ., USN A Mk VI patrol boat moored in the well deck of the Wasp class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan ., USN A source close to the program did acknowledge the costly maintenance issues associated with the Mk VI fleet that Marine Corps Major General King had brought up last month, but said they are more a product of poor training and the general command climate regarding these patrol boats than anything else. Whether this is true or not, one has to wonder whether some of these issues would have been alleviated, at least to some degree, by acquiring the full planned fleet of 48 boats. That would have required more significant investments in associated infrastructure and training and sustainment pipelines. Having just a dozen of them spread out in relatively small numbers around the world makes them very niche, low-density assets, something that very often comes with relatively high operating and maintenance costs. From a basic cost perspective, the Navy, or the U.S. government as a whole, could seek to recoup some of what it has spent on the Mk VIs already, or otherwise extract value from them, by transferring them to another branch or agency outside of the U.S. military, making them available to American allies or partners, or even selling them back to SBI. However, according to one source, there does not appear to be much interest in any of these proposals. The U.S. government did approve a sale of Mk VIs to Ukraine last year, in a slightly different configuration to the Navy examples, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , but SBI received a new contract to build those boats in January. Of course, it is important to remember that Congress could still very much step in to block the Navy’s plans regarding the Mk VIs. Legislators would need to be convinced of the service’s rationale for getting rid of the boats at a time when it is also talking about the need to significantly expand the size of its fleets to meet operational demands around the world. Just last year, it released a proposal, known as Battle Force 2045, that called for increasing the size of its overall fleet to 500 ships or more by 2045. You can read more about that force structure concept in these past War Zone pieces . President Joe Biden’s administration could also step in. It is already in the process of reviewing a number of significant policy positions and major acquisition programs, including Battle Force 2045 . It certainly seems curious, at least, that there is apparently no space within plans for a total fleet with more than 500 ships for even a modest number of smaller patrol boats and similar craft. So, it remains to be seen whether a year from now the Navy will still be operating any Mk VIs, despite its clear desire to divest them.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 11, 2021",The Oddly Shaped USS Grayback Was A Cold War Submarine Like No Other,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few of the U.S. Navy’s post-World War II submarines had such an unusual career as the USS Grayback. It went from carrying some of the United States’ first strategic missiles to stealthily delivering naval special forces to the coast of North Vietnam during the war in Southeast Asia. It was truly a fascinating and bizarrely-shaped boat whose multiple lives underscored how she was able to change along with a morphing Cold War. Here’s her story. Laid down on July 1, 1954, at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in San Francisco Bay, California, the first of the Grayback -class missile submarines was, like its sister, the USS Growler , built as a conventionally powered submarine that would have a primary armament of cruise missiles. The pair were the first submarines to be designed around an armament of subsonic Vought SSM-N-8 Regulus I strategic missiles. Four of these nuclear-armed, turbojet-powered weapons were carried in a pair of huge cylindrical hangars located above the bow. An SSM-N-9 Regulus II missile is maneuvered aboard the USS Grayback ., U.S. Navy The second submarine to carry the name, the USS Grayback was launched on July 2, 1957, and commissioned on March 7, 1958, as SSG-574. Ultimately, the submarine was one of five equipped to launch the Regulus I that were in service by 1960. To launch the airplane-sized missile, the submarine first had to surface, before the rear of the hangar was opened, and the Regulus I disgorged onto a trainable ramp that was recessed into the top of the hull, forward of the sail. The ramp was then turned sideways, and the missile blasted off under the power of a pair of solid-fuel rockets before the Allison J33 turbojet kicked in. The missile had a range of around 575 miles. The USS Grayback is waterborne after being launched at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on July 2, 1957., U.S. Navy The USS Grayback made history as the first submarine to carry Vought’s next-generation SSM-N-9 Regulus II and undertook trials with this Mach-2-capable weapon off the U.S. West Coast. Two of these weapons could be carried, compared to four of the previous Regulus Is and the first successful launch of the missile took place on September 16, 1958, while the Grayback was operating out of Naval Base Ventura County, California. However, the Regulus II was canceled later the same year, by which point the concept of the submarine-launched cruise missile had been overtaken by the development of the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile, which promised much greater range, speed, and reliability. On February 9, 1959, the USS Grayback departed Mare Island for Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, arriving at what would become its permanent home base on March 7. Between September and November of 1959, the submarine completed the first of nine deterrent missions, patrolling the Pacific with an armament of Regulus I missiles. In the course of these patrols, the Grayback spent more than 20 months at sea and logged well over 130,000 miles. Another view of a Regulus II on USS Grayback emphasizes the scale of these early strategic missiles., U.S. Navy The USS Grayback served in its strategic missile role until it was decommissioned on May 25, 1964, as the cruise-missile submarines divested their deterrence duties to the new Polaris boats. A new lease of life then began when the USS Grayback was converted as a submarine transport, initially under the pennant number APSS-574. The ability of submarines to transport personnel and materiel, as well as launch raiding parties ashore, while using its inherent capabilities to help avoid detection, was well established by the end of World War II, and would continue into the Cold War and beyond. It is a fascinating subset of underwater warfare that you can read all about in this previous War Zone article. The conversion work for the new role was authorized in 1967 and was undertaken at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard between November 1967 and May 1969. This included removing the Regulus equipment and lengthening the hull from 322 feet 4 inches to 334 feet. Mess and sleeping quarters now provided accommodation for up to 67 troops. The missile hangars were converted to carry six swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs) and a diver’s decompression chamber. The SDVs and scuba-equipped divers could be launched and recovered while the submarine submerged. The height of the sail was increased by around 10 feet and a Sperry BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) was fitted. A poor-quality but rare image of a swimmer delivery vehicle engaged in daytime launch and recovery operations by the USS Grayback . , National Archives The role of the “new” USS Grayback was carrying commando and other covert forces on special missions against targets that required a stealthy approach from the sea. Members of the U.S. Navy’s SEAL teams and Naval Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) were certainly carried onboard the submarine, as were, in all likelihood, U.S. Army Green Berets. UDTs would be used for example, for undertaking reconnaissance of possible landing zones ahead of an amphibious assault, or to clear the approaches to a beach. As well as its amphibious role, the USS Grayback could also perform similar duties as an attack submarine, for which it was armed with the thermal-powered Mk 14 anti-ship torpedo of World War II vintage and the electric-powered Mk 37 anti-submarine torpedo. These were operated using the Mk 106 Model 12 torpedo fire-control system. From August 1968 the submarine’s designation was changed again, to LPSS, indicating an amphibious transport submarine, and the new-look USS Grayback was commissioned for a second time on May 9, 1969. Thereafter, it was operated by the Pacific Fleet and based at Subic Bay in the Philippines. By the time of the Vietnam War, the Navy was using specially configured submarines to support special operations, the USS Grayback and the Gato class USS Tunny working along the coast of North Vietnam, and also helping gather intelligence. The submarine’s most dramatic — and secretive — mission took place in June 1972, during the conflict in Southeast Asia. This was Operation Thunderhead , an attempt to rescue U.S. prisoners of war that were planning to escape from North Vietnam’s notorious “ Hanoi Hilton ” prison. The two PoWs, both aviators, planned to steal a boat and make their escape by river to the Gulf of Tonkin, where they would be picked up by elite troops from the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team One, Platoon A, and Underwater Demolition Team 11 (UDT-11). Exactly how communications were run between PoWs and rescuers while planning this daring mission has not been explained. The USS Grayback departed Subic Bay to transport the special forces into the coastal waters off North Vietnam, where plans called for one or more Mk 7 SDVs to be launched under cover of darkness. Piloted by two operators from UDT-11, each SDV would deliver four SEALs from Platoon A to an island at the mouth of the Red River, which flowed into the Gulf of Tonkin. The Grayback was on station around 4,000 yards from the mouth of the river and at a depth of around 65 feet. SEALs on board Grayback ahead of Operation Thunderhead. Lieutenant Melvin Spence Dry is seated at center with papers in his hands., U.S. Navy A first attempt to launch a reconnaissance mission on June 3, 1972, ended in failure after the four-man team became lost, struggling with navigation errors and tidal currents that were much stronger than expected. Unable to relocate the USS Grayback , the team had to abandon their SDV after the vehicles’ batteries ran out. After eight hours they were rescued by a helicopter around 10 miles south of the submarine’s position and were then flown to the nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser USS Long Beach , which was stationed approximately 15 miles offshore, serving as the command ship for the mission. You can read all about that particular warship here . Two days later, the team was to be returned to the submarine by helicopter, with the aim of dropping them into the water alongside the USS Grayback , at night. Again, however, the submarine proved hard to find. Once it seemed the infrared locator beacon had been found, the operators jumped from the helicopter, but the chopper was flying too high and too fast for a safe jump and was downwind, meaning the jumpers hit the water with even much greater velocity. Lieutenant Melvin “Spence” Dry was killed immediately, and one other member of the team was seriously injured. Support divers from USS Grayback ready an SDV for launch operations at a depth of 35 feet. The vehicle was manned by personnel from Underwater Demolition Team 12., National Archives Meanwhile, the USS Grayback had launched another SDV, but this mission was abandoned too after its crew ran out of air. The second team came to the surface and it was their locator beacon that the first team had inadvertently found. The two teams rendezvoused before both were picked up by helicopter and returned to the USS Long Beach . After the United States began sowing mines in North Vietnamese ports and rivers, the chances of mission success were further reduced, and it was decided to abandon the PoW escape effort altogether. Operation Thunderhead remained classified for many years and it was not until 2008 that Lieutenant Dry’s death was finally acknowledged as a combat loss , and he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star for Valor.

USS Grayback underway in the South China Sea in 1982., National Archives Exactly what, if any covert missions, the USS Grayback was involved in during the years that followed is not known, but the Navy undoubtedly appreciated the submarine’s utility and it remained in service until decommissioned for a second and final time at Subic Bay on June 16, 1984. The Powhatan class fleet ocean tug USNS Catawba (ATF-168) towing the former Grayback out of Subic Bay in August 1986., U.S. Navy Befitting a boat with a less-than-conventional history, the USS Grayback received a bright orange paint scheme to increase its conspicuity before it was sunk as a target near Subic Bay on April 13, 1986. It brought to an end the story of a unique submarine — a guided-missile pioneer and a covert amphibious transport with a harrowing Vietnam combat record. Today, the legacy of the little-known amphibious transport submarines is kept alive by the Navy’s four Ohio class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines . They traded their strategic nuclear missile armament and now carry diverse cargoes ranging from Tomahawk cruise missiles to Navy SEALs. In this way, they continue the tradition of the USS Grayback , with capabilities befitting the demands of 21st-century warfare.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s probably no exaggeration to say that we at The War Zone have never seen a military vehicle that looks quite like this one — at least not one from the 21st century. The machine in question is reportedly the Lasok 4-P, which you could quite easily imagine being driven by a low-ranking villain in a Tim Burton movie . However, this plague mask -looking vehicle, according to reports, is envisaged for delivery to frontline units of the Russian military. The specification that led to this apparent oddity called for a new wheeled armored vehicle that can be transported by air — within the hold of the ubiquitous Mi-8 Hip medium-lift helicopter , in particular the Russian Aerospace Forces’ latest Mi-8AMTSh combat transport variant. That exacting requirement may explain, to some degree, the decidedly odd aesthetic of the resulting product. Russian Aerospace Forces Mi-8AMTSh combat transport helicopters., Russian Ministry of Defense Admittedly, the overall black paintwork and snowy backdrop to the photo that we have seen, posted to Twitter by Russian defense policy expert Rob Lee, who tweets as @RALee85 , adds to the overall weirdness. However, the vehicle itself has very little in common with the light tracked vehicles , up-armored all-terrain vehicles , or quad bikes that are otherwise frequently seen being disgorged from military helicopters. Instead, this vehicle’s design seems to have been driven by the decision to incorporate a V-shaped hull to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or mines. This likely resulted in the unorthodox angular bodywork. However, the flimsy-looking mudguards, spare wheel mounted on the door, and the shielded blackout headlamps all seem to owe more to a vehicle design from the interwar period between World War I and World War II than what you might see on the modern battlefield. It is unclear what the vehicle is constructed from, but portions of it at least appear to be covered with some sort of synthetic fabric. These could be a kind of insulation for winter operations of a type that has been seen on some Soviet and Russian vehicles in the past. To top it all off, the vehicle seems to have some sort of payload bin attached to the back, presumably to carry a modest external load. No visible armament is fitted. While the vehicle in the photo has been identified as the Lasok 4-P, we don’t know for sure that’s what it is. What we do know about the Lasok 4-P is provided by the website of the Innovatsionnoye Shassi, or Innovative Chassis, company, based in Samara, in southwest Russia. “In 2020, under the guidance of specialists from the Innovative Chassis Research Center, a prototype of a compact armored vehicle — the Lasok Airmobile Light Armored Vehicle — was proactively assembled,” a press release on the company website reads. The company says that the four-seat Lasok 4-P prototype is based on a modular layout derived from the Locust armored assault vehicle, or BShM, but incorporates a lighter four-wheel-drive chassis. What is somewhat perplexing, perhaps, is that an artist’s concept of the Locust depicts a much more conventional vehicle, at least for this type of role. While retaining the V-shaped hull, this artwork suggests a vehicle with considerably greater off-road mobility, thanks to its larger, uncovered wheels, as well as more serious armor protection, and armament in the form of a turret that appears to mount a heavy machine gun. However, it is likely too high, and probably too heavy, to be accommodated in a Mi-8 series helicopter. An artist’s concept of the Locust, or BShM, armored assault vehicle., Innovatsionnoye Shassi Again, it’s explained that the new design for the Lasok 4-P was based around the specific need to be accommodated in the hold of a Mi-8, which can carry loads of approximately 8,800 pounds and, in Mi-8T form, has a height of around 6 feet, length of 17 feet 6 inches, and width of 6 feet 9 inches. As such, the Hip can normally only transport vehicles in the class of the civilian Lada Niva , or the military UAZ-469 jeep, which still needs the top of its roof removed for transit. The UAZ-469 jeep, the design of which dates back to the early Cold War., Vitaly V. Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons “What army units needed is an armored car — all-wheel drive, compact and lightweight, built on the basis of domestic series-produced units.” The Lasok 4-P is the result. The company says that work on this only began in the second half of 2019 and the rapid development was achieved thanks to “working with partners in an outsourcing system.” “The appearance of the prototype of the Lasok 4-P armored vehicle is still a commercial secret since the registration of a number of patents for inventions that are directly related to the design and configuration of the hull of the new armored vehicle has not yet been completed,” the firm claims. Innovatsionnoye Shassi says the design of its Lasok 4-P was informed by “detailed analysis of combat operations in various local conflicts” and that the vehicle is intended for use by special forces, advanced combat and reconnaissance groups, patrolling, and for supporting engineering and assault units, including in mountainous and rugged terrain. The curb weight of the prototype is said to be 4,500 pounds, including an engine taken from an unnamed series-production vehicle. Gross weight is up to 5,900 pounds, and carrying capacity is approximately 1,400 pounds. A production version would be expected to see the curb weight trimmed to 4,200 pounds, and carrying capacity increased to 1,700 pounds. “Due to efficiently rational angles of inclination of the armor surfaces and components of the spaced armor, the total thickness of the elements of the steel armor of the hull does not exceed 4.5mm [0.18 inches],” the company notes. “The thickness of the frontal armor in some areas is 6-8 mm.” The glass is said to be bulletproof and overall, the level of ballistic protection should be Class 4, or, as an option, Class 5. Class 5 would correspond to the GAZ-233036 Tigr used by Russian counter-terrorist units, for example, and also to the NATO STANAG 4569 Level 2 ballistic protection. A GAZ-233036 Tigr vehicle during a demonstration., Vitaly Kuzmin/Wikimedia Commons “Of course, based on the provision of the required capacity, a given level of mine protection and air-mobility, the Lasok 4-P armored vehicle has a relatively low protection class in terms of ballistic performance,” the company admits. In fact, it says it is inferior to the World War II-era BA-64 light armored car. A Soviet BA-64 light armored car in the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr, Dresden, Germany., Pudelek/Wikimedia Commons While that admission hardly instills confidence, the company also states that: “The special configuration and layout of the armor capsule, among other advantages, also provides the ability to quickly replace the driver in the driver’s seat (for example, in the event of his disability), without leaving the interior of the armored vehicle.” Clearly, air-mobility takes precedence over crew protection. The manufacturer says that the Lasok 4-P can be modified as an armored command and staff vehicle, for commanders of battalion-level units, for patrol groups, or for communication duties. A production version should also have armament, in the form of a machine gun, up to 12.7mm in caliber, on a “tower installation” that can retract into the cabin when not in use. A folding armored shield will be provided for the gunner. Other adaptations are intended to include tire deformation limiters to allow the vehicle to keep running after taking a hit to a tire, and a towed single-axle trailer that can carry another three to five troops. This latter would allow a complete infantry squad to be moved by a single Lasok 4-P. Looking further ahead, there are also plans for a “super-light combat amphibian ” version as well as the addition of remote-controlled weapons stations. Last but not least, the company plans to develop counter-drone versions of the vehicle, which would be equipped with electronic countermeasures to disrupt the guidance systems used by unmanned aerial vehicles. Of course, we don’t know with absolute certainty that this vehicle seen in the snow really is the Lasok 4-P. If it is as reported, we probably shouldn’t write it off too soon, based on looks alone. If the 1900s-looking armored buggy is eventually issued in quantity, it could yet enhance the capabilities of Russia’s air assault forces.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2021",Obscure 23-Year Old Navy SAM Was So Ahead Of Its Time That It’s Still In High Demand Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Raytheon’s Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, has sucked up most of the public’s attention in recent years as it has become the most versatile surface-to-air and surface-to-surface weapon in the U.S. Navy’s arsenal. Other services are now taking notice , too, and the Navy is already working on building an even more capable version. Still, the older SM-2 branch of the Standard family of missiles, also sometimes referred to collectively in its newer form as the SM-2 Medium Range (SM-2MR), remains the backbone of the Navy’s area air defense capability. These missiles sit in hundreds of vertical launch cells and ships’ magazines around the globe, ready to defend U.S. and allied fleets against a range of aerial threats. Although few know much about it, of the SM-2 variants that are in service now, as well as those that are planned for the future, the Block IIIB version is particularly notable. It has a dual-mode guidance package, with semi-active radar and infrared homing seekers installed on the same missile. The Block IIIB, which first entered service in 1998, was way ahead of its time and its capabilities will continue to remain very valuable in the coming years as potential adversaries, especially China and Russia, field increasingly advanced electronic warfare systems and other countermeasures , as well as low-observable (stealth) technologies . A rare picture of an SM-2 Block IIIB missile launch. The fairing with the infrared seeker is seen on the right side of the missile’s forward body., USN At the core of the Block IIIB variant is the basic SM-2 Block III missile , production of which had started in 1988. At that time, the Block III represented the apex of the development of the medium-range Standard missile, or RIM-66, which had first begun in 1963 with the aim of replacing older RIM-2 Terrier and RIM-24 Tartar missiles. The first medium-range Standard, also known as Standard Missile 1 Medium Range (SM-1MR), entered service in 1967. Between then and 1968, four blocks of the SM-1MR were developed, with relatively minor improvements. All of these were designated as subvariants of the RIM-66A. The Navy subsequently acquired a Block V SM-1MR, also designated the RIM-66B, which included much more substantial changes, including a new seeker, autopilot, warhead, and rocket motor. This combined to make the missile more accurate, harder-hitting, and capable of engaging targets at higher altitudes and further away. The first missile in the SM-2MR series, which are also designated as variants of the RIM-66, was developed primarily to complement the then-new Aegis Combat System in the 1970s. The initial SM-2MR variant, the RIM-66C, was designed to be command-guided to the general target area by an Aegis-equipped ship via a data link and then use semi-active radar homing—where the ship ‘illuminates’ the target with its radar systems and missile’s seeker homes in on the reflected radar energy—in the terminal stage of flight. The SM-2 also had an upgraded semi-active radar homing seeker compared to earlier SM-1 variants. A Standard-series missile is fired from the deck-mounted arm launcher on a US Navy Oliver-Hazard Perry class frigate., USN The value of the improvements found on the SM-2MR meant that a subsequent version was developed for non-Aegis ships. This variant, known as the RIM-66D, would be preprogrammed right before launch to head to a designated target area using its inertial navigation system (INS) guidance package alone, before switching over to its semi-active radar seeker to actually find its mark. Block II SM-2MR variants began arriving in 1983, featuring new warheads and rocket motors, the latter of which expanded their range out to around 90 miles, as well as their ability to engage more maneuverable targets. The Block II subvariants also included the first missile in the series to be designed to be fired from Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells, as well as one for non-VLS equipped ships. At around the same time, a final Block VI version of the SM-1MR, also appeared, subvariants of which progressively incorporated other improvements from the SM-2 series, including new seekers and warheads. A RIM-66G, an SM-2MR subvariant, is fired from a deck-mounted launcher., USN The Block III’s main improvement over the earlier SM-2s had been the addition of an upgraded radar proximity fuze. This improved the reliability with which the missile’s warhead detonated during intercepts, especially when engaging targets at low altitudes, such as anti-ship cruise missiles. As with the Block IIs, the Block III missile came in three subvariants , the RIM-66K, RIM-66L, and RIM-66M. The RIM-66K was the version for non-Aegis ships, while the RIM-66L was the one for vessels with the Aegis Combat System. The RIM-66M was the Aegis-compatible type configured to be fired from the Mk 41 VLS. In 1991, production then began of the further improved Block IIIA missile, which featured a more powerful blast-fragmentation warhead. Different versions of these weapons were also made that were compatible with the older deck-mounted arm launchers, as well as the newer Mk 41 VLS. Then came the Block IIIB variant, the focus of this article, which combined the Block IIIA with a guidance package developed under the Missile Homing Improvement Program (MHIP). The complete MHIP guidance system is distinct from that on earlier SM-2s, though it still includes a semi-active radar seeker in the nose. In addition, it has an infrared seeker mounted inside a small streamlined fairing that juts out from the side of the missile’s forward body. You can see this arrangement in the photo at the top of this post. A graphical chronology of the development of the SM-2 family, as well as its predecessors., John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory The Navy had developed the MHIP guidance package in part for improved air and surface-launched versions of the Sparrow missile , which were designated AIM-7R and RIM-7R, respectively. The service canceled this improved Sparrow project in 1996 over rising costs. This was done despite the largely successful completion of an operational evaluation and in spite of a plan to save money by converting older Sparrow models to new R variant configuration. A RIM-7 Sea Sparrow variant with a single-mode guidance system seen right as it is launched., USN In the end, the MHIP guidance system was only ever used on the Block IIIB variant of the SM-2. Unlike earlier SM-2s, this missile was designed to only be fired from the Mk 41 VLS. As of 2017, all three Block III subvariants, as well as the extended-range SM-2 Block IV, also known as the RIM-156A, that also first entered service in 1998, were still in use, according to the Navy , providing its ships with a mixture of capabilities. It’s interesting to note that the Navy was also working on a dual-mode RIM-156B variant before canceling that project in 2001. That weapon had been intended to serve as an anti-ballistic missile interceptor. The focus subsequently shifted to the development of the SM-3 and SM-6 variants of the Standard missile for knocking down various types of ballistic missiles at different points of their flight. A briefing slide laying out the US Navy’s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense capabilities as of 2012, including details about the SM-3 Block IB and SM-6 interceptors., DOD The Block IIIB’s unique dual-mode guidance package makes it very capable against a wide array of targets in multiple engagement scenarios. The infrared seeker importantly provides an alternative means of finding the target in the terminal phase of flight even in heavy electronic warfare combat environments. Similarly, if the optics on the infrared part of the guidance system are degraded, blinded, or confused, it still has the semi-active radar homing option. Most of all, the infrared seeker allows for these missiles to obtain lock when engaging targets flying at very low altitudes that are beyond the line-of-sight of the Mk 82 guided missile radar director’s AN/SPG-62 illuminators, three of which equip each Arleigh Burke class destroyer and four of which are on every Ticonderoga class cruiser . They are used to ‘paint’ or ‘illuminate’ the target during the missile’s endgame terminal phase of flight. This is not possible when engaging very low-flying targets at significant ranges due to the curvature of the earth. Two of the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Wilbur Wright ‘s three AN/SPG-62 illuminators. , Hunini/Wikicommons Without the infrared component, the SM-2 Block IIIB’s radar seeker is dependent on homing in on reflected radar energy produced by the ship. With the addition of passive infrared homing, it does not have to rely on radar illumination of a target. So, even if the illuminator is in the shadow of the Earth’s curvature, the missile can still make the kill. It also helps when engaging small radar cross-section (stealthy) targets or those with advanced electronic warfare capabilities in any flight profile, as well. The IR seeker is impervious to these countermeasures. To detail how these missiles work, the SM-2MR leverages data-link networking and inertial navigation to get itself out in an area where it can make its terminal attack run on the target, which can be dozens of miles. The Aegis SPY-1 radar data is sent to the missile—this information can now also come from a third-party asset, such as an E-2 Hawkeye flying overhead—as it flies out toward the target. Prior to its final run on the target, the ship illuminates the target, at which time the missile’s semi-active radar seeker would lock onto the reflected radar energy. In the case of the Block IIIB, the infrared sensor would also lock onto the target, making it extremely hard for the target to survive the missile’s attack. If the target cannot be illuminated, the infrared seeker can still prosecute the target on its own. In the end, the dual-mode seeker setup doesn’t just make certain engagements possible, it offers a better probability of kill overall. JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST The SM-2 Block IIIB’s guidance system makes it stand out from most Western medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missiles, as well as air-to-air weapons in similar classes, the vast majority of which use some kind of radar homing alone. The two newest Block III variants, the Block IIIAZ, developed solely for use on the Navy’s Zumwalt class stealth destroyers , and the still-in-development Block IIIC, have single-mode guidance systems. The Block IIIAZ is a modification of the Block IIIA design to work with the Zumwalt ‘s unique radar and combat system configuration, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , while the Block IIIC is an upgrade of older Block III missiles that replacing the semi-active radar guidance system with the much more capable active-radar seeker from the SM-6. Adding the active seeker will allow these missiles to engage targets without launch platform illumination and, much like the infrared seeker on the Block IIIB, allow them to engage low-flying targets below the radar horizon of the launching vessel. The latest active seekers are very capable and are hard to jam and decoy, but dual-mode seekers still offer some insurance when it comes to either seeker type failing or being confused for whatever reason during the terminal phase of an engagement. The best mix today would be both passive imaging infrared homing and active radar homing on the same missile. America’s near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China, are well aware of all of this and have made substantial investments in aerial electronic warfare capabilities. Increasingly advanced self-protection jammers for aircraft, as well as other countermeasures systems , are proliferating more and more, even to smaller militaries , too. Cruise missiles themselves are increasingly built with countermeasure capabilities, including small radar cross-section (stealthy) characteristics and more. The importance, then, of multi-mode guidance systems for surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles is becoming ever more apparent around the world, including within the U.S. military. It seems more likely than not, for instance, that the new AIM-260 long-range air-to-air missile that Lockheed Martin is developing now for the Navy, and, by extension the U.S. Marine Corps, as well as the U.S. Air Force, will have a multi-mode guidance package. Peregrine , a compact air-to-air missile that Raytheon unveiled in 2019, will also feature a “multi-mode autonomous seeker,” according to that company. The most notable surface-to-air missile that is operational today with this dual-mode capability is Israel’s Stunner. It is the missile used by the David’s Sling air defense system that is currently a major component of Israel’s layered integrated air and missile defense system. It features an active radar and imaging infrared seeker in its unique ‘dolphin’ nosecone. This is widely considered as a ‘best of both worlds’ combination which is thought to make evasion, jamming, or decoying the missile largely impossible. It has been reported that Israel is now working on an air-to-air derivative of its Stunner surface-to-air missile. In many regards, the Stunner is the modern successor of the SM-2 Block IIIB concept. You can read all about the Stunner in this past feature of ours. Stunner missile being launched. , IDF Multi-mode guidance systems are also becoming increasingly popular on air-to-ground and ground-launched munitions due to the flexibility they provide when engaging multiple types of targets under diverse conditions. This is especially true for moving targets that are targeted over the horizon. With all this in mind, it’s no surprise then that the Navy expects to continue fielding the SM-2 Block IIIB through at least 2035 , well after the new Block IIIC missiles are slated to start filling Mk 41 VLS cells on the service’s warships in 2022. The Block IIIB missiles are also set to stay in use for years to come even as other advanced surface-to-air missiles, such as variants of the SM-6, enter more widespread service. The Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin fires two SM-2 missiles during exercise Valiant Shield 2014., USN One would imagine that the Navy would not want to give up its SM-2 Block IIIB until it can acquire a suitable replacement, which could also feature multi-mode guidance. The service does say that the Block IIIC missile offers “enhanced capability against electronic attack” since its active radar seeker doesn’t require a ship to illuminate the target with its own SPG-62 Illuminator during its terminal phase of flight. But as we mentioned earlier, it still doesn’t provide the same kind of jam-resistant alternative guidance option that an infrared seeker does. It’s also worth noting that the SM-2 Block IIIBs represent a lower-cost-per-engagement option compared to the Block IIIC, despite the dual-mode guidance. They’re certainly cheaper than SM-6s, though those missiles are much more capable and are intended for a wider array of targets. The Navy bought its last Block IIIBs in the 2011 Fiscal Year, at which time the unit cost for each missile was approximately $1.138 million, or around $1.316 million in 2020 dollars. In its Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request, the Navy said it expected to pay $2.349 million for each conversion kit to turn existing older Block III SM-2s into Block IIICs. The stated unit price of the SM-6 in those same documents was just over $4.318 million. If Block IIIBs are still within this price range, it could make them attractive to foreign countries that field other SM-2 variants or otherwise have ships capable of firing them. In 2020, Raytheon notably restarted the SM-2 production line in order to meet existing demand for Block IIIBs, as well as Block IIIAs and Block IIICs, from various countries. Australia , Japan , and South Korea are among the customers currently in process of acquiring new-build Block IIIB missiles. Spain also secured approval to buy these weapons in 2018. In addition, the Netherlands has Block IIIA missiles on order , while Taiwan and Chile have recently received approval to buy those missiles. Canada has been approved to buy Block IIICs , as well. This is of no surprise as the threat of ever more advanced anti-ship missiles is ballooning. While it gets little attention, the U.S. Navy will also continue to make use of the SM-2 Block IIIB missiles, along with the ‘ahead of its time’ capabilities that they offer, for years to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 3, 2020",There’s One Place In The World Where AC-47 Spooky Gunships Still Fly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The AC-47 Spooky gunship , the forerunner of today’s AC-130s , which first went to war over Vietnam in the mid-1960s, is still in frontline service with just a single air arm. Based on the venerable World War II-era C-47 transport , the AC-47, which was dubbed “Puff the Magic Dragon” during its operations in Southeast Asia, survives now, albeit in a significantly upgraded form, only over the jungles of South America, in the hands of the Colombian Air Force . These aircraft, named Fantasmas, or ghosts in Spanish, still pack a punch, even though some of the airframes were originally built more than 60 years ago — indeed, one of them is even a veteran of the D-Day invasion. The Colombian Air Force currently has around six AC-47T Fantasma gunships in its inventory, although not all of these are active at any one time. They are flown by a single unit, based at Palanquero Air Base in the heart of the country, although in the past they have also been deployed at other airfields depending on operational requirements. The upgraded AC-47T version was first introduced in 1994, replacing the original AC-47 that had been converted as a gunship from the mid-1980s. A pair of Colombian Air Force AC-47T Fantasma aircraft., Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino Colombia’s Fantasmas entered service more than two decades after the U.S. Air Force’s very first AC-47 gunships arrived at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in what was then South Vietnam in late 1965. These aircraft were equipped with three rapid-firing 7.62mm Miniguns firing through windows along the port side of the cabin. Once there, these aircraft quickly began to prove out the fixed-wing gunship concept. Before long, the AC-47s were supplanted by more capable AC-130 and AC-119 gunships , which packed heavier armament, as well as improved sensors and defensive capabilities. Today, the U.S. Air Force continues to operate highly-modified AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider gunships. A U.S. Air Force AC-47 from the 4th Special Operations Squadron, probably at Nha Trang, South Vietnam, in 1968., U.S. Air Force A handful of operators in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa continued to fly AC-47s in various configurations even after the type had been completely phased out of U.S. Air Force service. The last of these aircraft that remain active today is the Fantasma of the Colombian Air Force’s Escuadrón de Combate Táctico 113 — or 113th Tactical Combat Squadron. Colombia’s history with the AC-47 dates back to the mid-1980s when the country was waging an internal counterinsurgency campaign against guerrillas, chiefly the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC. To provide additional, more flexible firepower to take on these threats, the Colombian Air Force turned to its surviving C-47 transports. Dozens of these aircraft, variants of the DC-3 airliner, had been delivered to the country beginning in the 1940s and they remained highly prized, above all, for their ability to operate from poorly prepared jungle airstrips. The video below shows DC-3s, which remain in service with airlines and charter services in Colombia, taking off and landing from an austere airstrip of the kind found in many parts of the country. Beginning in 1987, some of the C-47s were converted to gunships, inspired by the Vietnam-era AC-47. With support from the United States, these aircraft were fitted with three 0.5-inch caliber Browning machine guns, plus additional navigation and communications equipment. The configuration with three .50-caliber weapons was specifically developed for U.S. Air Force units based in Latin America in the 1960s and came about due to the perpetual shortage of the Miniguns used on the Spooky in Southeast Asia. It then quickly became one of the more popular configurations for foreign users in both Southeast Asia and Latin America. Since the Colombian AC-47 aircraft have always operated almost exclusively at night, they were also fitted with flare launchers to illuminate the battlefield. While flares were necessary during the days before night-vision equipment became available, they had the disadvantage of revealing the aircraft’s position to the enemy below. Meanwhile, the pilot’s window was equipped with a sight borrowed from a Lockheed T-33 jet trainer to help aim the weapons . Five aircraft were originally modified in this way, but one was lost in an accident in 1988. The cockpit of the AC-47T Fantasma., Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino Despite the promise showed by the AC-47s in Colombia’s counterinsurgency campaigns, the aircraft was dogged by its veteran Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial engines. These struggled in high-altitude environments and, during intensive operations, engine failures became more commonplace. The aging AC-47s were then provided with a new lease of life, once the U.S. firm Basler offered its BT-67 conversion. This involved swapping out the old radial engines for Pratty & Whitney PT6A-67R turboprops, each rated at over 1,400 horsepower, driving new five-bladed Hartzell propellers. At the same time, the forward fuselage was lengthened by just over three feet, moving the pilots forward of the propellers and preserving the center of gravity. As well as the fuselage stretch and the new engines, these aircraft were fitted with a Star SAFIRE forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret below the nose, meaning the illumination flares no longer needed to be used. Additional communications equipment was provided, to maintain contact with ground forces, as well as for communications within the aircraft. The first three aircraft sent for conversion arrived at Basler facility in Wisconsin in 1993 and a total of nine aircraft were eventually modified to the AC-47T standard. Three have since been lost in accidents. The aircraft are typically flown by two pilots, a navigator (also responsible for operating the FLIR and communications), a mechanic, and three armorers responsible for the guns. Since 1997, the crews have also been provided with night-vision goggles. For anti-guerrilla missions, the AC-47T can also serve as an airborne forward air controller (FAC-A) or airborne command post, with the navigator coordinating the operation below. With an endurance of up to 10 hours, the Fantasma is ideal for this role. In some anti-FARC missions, as many as 40 aircraft have been involved — including Kfir fighter jets and A-37 Dragonfly and A-29B Super Tucano light attack aircraft, as well as various helicopters — all directed by a Fantasma in the command post role. The navigator’s station in the Fantasma includes the controls for the FLIR turret. , Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino The aircraft’s firepower has also been given a boost, with the single-barrel Brownings having been replaced by three-barreled .50-caliber GAU-19/A Gatling-type machine guns. These guns offer a more rapid rate of fire and don’t suffer from overheating issues that plagued the Brownings. As an option, one of the GAU-19A/s can be replaced with a French-made 20mm-caliber GIAT M621 cannon, used to defeat hardened targets. Firing the GAU-19/A Minigun., Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino Since the guns are fixed, aiming them relies on the pilot’s careful control inputs. One of the pilots of the Fantasma squadron explained this in more detail in an interview with Combat Aircraft Monthly magazine: The wind, speed, height, and banking all affect the trajectory of fire. With each burst, you adjust the aiming. When I fly I watch the sight, the ground, and my screen to see what the navigator is watching on the FLIR. The key is to work well between the navigator and the pilot. A good navigator must have the capacity to identify the guerrillas; they hide in the trees, walk like animals — they have tactics. The FLIR has a laser and I only have to aim where the laser is. The navigator gives me the azimuth. By day it’s more difficult; I can’t see the laser and it’s more difficult to see the light of the sight. Other improvements have also been made to the Fantasma, including chaff and flare dispensers to defeat the guerillas’ shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, also known as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS . The FLIR turret has been updated, with a BRITE Star II offering improved definition, and the communications suite now includes satellite communications and GPS. Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino Exactly how many of the AC-47Ts remain active in Colombia is unclear. As of 2014, six were reportedly in service. By 2020, three were confirmed as being active — one of these airframes is a former British Royal Air Force aircraft dating back to the 1940s. Another is a D-Day veteran that flew over Normandy in 1944 with the U.S. Army Air Force. However, the aircraft, in general, are fairly easy to maintain and non-airworthy aircraft could potentially be returned to service. Spares are not a particular problem, either, as Colombia is also home to a significant fleet of C-47s in commercial service. Age, perhaps, is not the biggest concern for the future of the Fantasma. Since the historic 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and FARC brought an end to more than 50 years of conflict, the Air Force has no longer faced the same level of threat from what was perhaps the most powerful guerrilla group in the continent. Similar peace deals have been negotiated with other rebel groups, too, including Quintin Lamé, the M-19, and the Ejercito Popular de Liberación, or EPL. AC-47Ts release infrared countermeasures for self-defense., Cees-Jan van der Ende and Cristobal Soto Pino However, the peace deal with FARC proved to be fairly fragile and attacks on civilians, as well as assassinations of local leaders and former guerrillas, continued. Since Colombian President Ivan Duque took office in 2018, the situation has only worsened, with rural areas, in particular, seeing increases in violence . Meanwhile, another leftist guerrilla group, the Ejército de Liberación Nacional, or ELN, remains active, and only yesterday the group denied that it was planning a possible attack in Bogota, the Colombian capital. In addition, Colombia continues to grapple with smaller groups primarily linked to drug trafficking, as well as illegal mining, and a counterinsurgency capability remains a priority. The years of experience gained in successful operations with the AC-47T likely means that the Air Force will continue to fly these firebreathing antiques for the foreseeable future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force says that its unique Super Bowl flyover this year, which involved one of each of its three current heavy bomber types, reflected actual work being done on new concepts of operation. Just days before the big game, a B-1B and a B-52H flew together in a test to explore how these aircraft might work more directly together in actual combat, including sharing targeting information that could be used to fire stealthy AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, or JASSMs. Personnel from the 49th and 337th Test and Evaluation Squadrons carried out the test from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana on Feb. 3, 2021. The 49th and 337th are responsible for testing and evaluating upgrades and modifications, as well as new tactics, techniques, and procedures, for the B-52H and B-1B bombers, respectively. Both units are assigned to the 53rd Test and Evaluation Group at Nellis Air Force base in Nevada, which is a geographically separated component of the 53rd Wing, headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. A B-52H bomber, in front, shares the ramp at Barksdale Air Force Base with a B-1B, behind, in 2016., USAF For this flight, a B-52H pilot and weapon systems officer flew in the B-1B and vice versa. The planes conducted various maneuvers inside the “Lancer” training area, situated to the west of Dallas, Texas, according to Air Force Magazine . “This unique opportunity allowed the aircrew to gain a better understanding and perspective of one another as the two units develop tactics for bomber interoperability and stand-off weapon employment,” the Air Force said. The service has been conducting similar “ integration flights ” since 2016. However, “the intent behind this bomber test integration event went beyond the cross-learning benefit from the inter-fly opportunity,” Air Force Colonel Jamie Hernandez, head of the 53rd Test Management Group, also part of the 53rd Wing, said in a statement. The testing “instead focused on developing, testing and vetting integrated tactics to provide the warfighter with the techniques and procedures and Combatant Commanders the option and flexibility to employ the B-1 and B-52 as an integrated and synergistic long-range weapon force package.” “A goal of these tests was to fly in formation to do practice stand-off weapons sorties so we can start building how we fly together, pass targets if we get new ones, and how we ultimately work together,” Air Force Major Joseph Wilkinson, a B-1 Instructor Weapon Systems Officer from the 337th, added. A spokesperson for Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees all of the Air Force’s bomber fleets, told Air Force Magazine that the test specifically involved exploring “handoff techniques” when employing variants of the AGM-158 JASSM . It’s not clear whether the operational concept in question only involved the transfer of targeting data or whether one bomber is expected to actually launch the missile, after which the other aircraft would begin sending updates to it via its data link. At present, the Air Force has a fleet of around 76 B-52H bombers, 40 of which are configured to carry nuclear-armed AGM-86B cruise missiles , among other weapons. Of those aircraft, four are permanently set aside for test work. The remaining examples have been modified to be only able to carry conventional weapons. Another 10 airframes in storage are kept in a closer-to-operational state than usual to make it easier to return them to service , if necessary. The service also has some 62 B-1Bs, a pair of which are also dedicated test aircraft. There are plans in the works to retire the 17 oldest jets in that fleet this year, which would leave 43 combat-coded bombers. Since 2011 , all of these aircraft have been configured to only carry conventional weapons and there are no plans at present to restore their nuclear capabilities. For many years, before and after the Cold War, the Air Force’s B-52Hs and B-1Bs offered certain distinct capabilities, with the latter bombers actually have a larger overall payload capacity, as well as being faster and having a smaller radar signature. The B-52Hs, of course, had the benefit, and still do, of being able to carry additional, often outsized payloads , externally, something the B-1Bs have been unable to do for much of their careers. A B-52H bomber takes off carrying two captive-carry test articles being used in the development of the AGM-183 hypersonic missile., USAF However, especially in the past two decades, starting with the beginning of the Global War on Terror, the B-52s have found themselves increasingly employed in conventional roles , including for close air support (CAS). The B-1Bs, which had lost their nuclear mission in the mid-1990s, despite the physical conversion work continuing for years afterward, were also actively deployed to support America’s conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. This has continued in the more recent campaigns against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, with B-1Bs being extremely heavily used in the CAS role. The fight against ISIS took a massive toll on the B-1B fleet, overall, leaving it in an extremely poor state of readiness by 2019, something it has only just begun to recover from. The Air Force subsequently prohibited these aircraft from conducting low-level flight operations and scaled back their allowable annual flight hours, as a whole. The service has also now reportedly blocked the B-1B fleet from making any more deployments to conduct CAS or other similar conventional missions in support of ongoing combat operations. Overall, the Air Force has dramatically shifted the focus of bomber operations, globally, toward activities meant to deter or otherwise signal America’s long-range strike capabilities to potential adversaries, including Russia and China , as well as Iran and North Korea . This has included overflights of potentially politically sensitive areas in and around the Pacific and Europe , as well as flying long-distance non-stop sorties to and from various strategically significant areas . In addition, Air Force bombers, to include its B-2 Spirit stealth bombers , are visiting more and more remote or otherwise unusual locations . This is part of a broader effort to expand the number of bases these aircraft could make use of during a conflict to distribute their operations, make them less predictable , and generally reduce their vulnerability to hostile forces. At the same time, the conventional arsenals of the B-1s and B-52s are growing, with plans to integrate new hypersonic weapons onto both types in the coming years . The Air Force is also working with Boeing on reactivating the B-1Bs six external hardpoints, an obscure capability that has never seen widespread use and was originally intended specifically for carrying nuclear weapons. At present, these bombers typically only fly with one pylon installed, which has almost exclusively been used to mount a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). There is now an interest in using them to carry various kinds of conventional munitions, including JASSMs and hypersonic missiles . The B-1B is also becoming an increasingly important long-range anti-ship platform in combination with the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). The AGM-158C is a derivative of the JASSM family, which was, as already noted, a key factor in this recent interoperability test out of Barksdale. These missiles reached initial operational capability on the B-1B in 2018. All told, it’s not difficult at all to envision a future conflict where groups of B-1B and B-52H bombers are tasked to engage the same general target sets across a broad area. Improving direct interoperability between the two types would help make those operations more complementary and efficient, especially if the jets could share targeting information or begin sending target updates directly to a weapon already launched by another aircraft. Conceivably, in the future, a B-52H crew aware of threats in a certain area, but with no more weapons left onboard, could pass targeting information to any B-1Bs nearby that still had the ability to prosecute targets, or vice versa. In many ways, this simply reflects the Air Force’s general desire to reach a future state in which various networks exist to rapidly get information to and from the best platforms for the job, regardless of whether they’re bombers or any other kind of aircraft , or even platforms on the ground , at sea , or in space . It very much remains to be seen what other kinds of complementary capabilities might be produced by having B-1Bs and B-52Hs work more closely together operationally. An AFGCS spokesperson told Air Force Magazine that this experimentation has been following a “crawl, walk, run” approach “and we’re very much at the ‘crawl’ stage now.” However the effort evolves now, it seems more and more likely that we will see different types of Air Force bombers flying together operationally, not just in flyovers at the beginning of major sporting events.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",The Iconic Learjet Will Come To An End After Six Decades Of Defining Private Air Travel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s almost the end of the line for one of the most famous names in business aviation, or in aerospace altogether, with the news that manufacturer Bombardier is bringing production of the Learjet to an end this year. It’s a blow for the company’s 1,500-strong Wichita-based workforce, which will be cut back as a result, and it also brings the curtain down on what’s perhaps the world’s most familiar bizjet . “With more than 3,000 aircraft delivered since its entry into service in 1963, the iconic Learjet aircraft has had a remarkable and lasting impact on business aviation,” said Éric Martel, Bombardier’s president and chief executive officer, in a statement today. “However, given the increasingly challenging market dynamics, we have made this difficult decision to end Learjet production.” The Model 75 Liberty will now be the final production Learjet., Bombardier The most significant effect of the decision, which seems to have been influenced by changing market trends, which include much more competition in the light jet segment, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , will be felt by the workforce of the Montreal-headquartered company. In Wichita, around 250 employees can expect to lose their jobs in the next 12 months, once production of the Learjet winds down starting from this fall. There’s still the possibility that some of them could be reassigned to roles elsewhere in the company, but that would involve “collective bargaining” with Bombardier, according to the Wichita Eagle newspaper. These job losses, however, are sadly just a fraction of those likely across the company as it restructures, weathering the storm that COVID-19 has wrought on the wider commercial aerospace industries. In all, 1,600 jobs are expected to be lost across the firm , around half of them in Canada. However, while most of those job losses will be white-collar, office positions, the situation is different in Wichita, where most of those at risk are the shopfloor workers responsible for actually building the Learjets. Early Learjets awaiting delivery on the factory airfield in Wichita., Bombardier Martel described the reductions in the workforce as “absolutely necessary for us to rebuild our company while we continue to navigate through the pandemic.” Among the changes coming into force, as well as a slimmed-down workforce, are an increased focus on providing services, while the manufacturing efforts in the bizjet segment will focus on the Challenger and Global Express aircraft families. Both these series offer considerably more potential for growth and development, and are meanwhile far more popular among customers. That said, the decision doesn’t take anything away from the incredible legacy the Learjet has established. It’s little short of astonishing to think that the very first prototype Learjet took to the air in Wichita on October 7, 1963. It was part of the first generation of bizjets but, remarkably, its design was inspired by the indigenous Swiss FFA P-16 single-seat fighter, which William P. “Bill” Lear encountered after he retired to Switzerland in the late 1950s. While the P-16 was never ordered in quantity, the Swiss-American Aircraft Corporation Learjet 23, as it was originally known, became a breakout success story. The P-16 jet fighter that inspired the design of the Learjet’s wing., Paebi/Wikmedia Commons Fast, sleek-looking, and capable of being operated by a single pilot, the Learjet 23 was powered by a pair of General Electric CJ610 turbojets — a non-afterburning adaptation of the J85 powerplant used in the T-38 Talon jet trainer — and quickly won orders. The new bizjet reportedly boasted a higher initial climb rate than the F-100 Super Sabre jet fighter and the highest cruising altitude of any aircraft in its class. Father of the Learjet, William P. “Bill” Lear., San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive Other features included manual flight controls, but powered spoilers, a T-tail, and a fuselage that was just 62 inches wide and 54 inches high. In 1965, the manufacturer, by then named Lear Jet Corporation, began working on the Learjet 24, with an increased maximum takeoff weight, that was first flown on February 24, 1966. A Learjet 23, left, together with a Cessna T-37, both used by NASA as chase aircraft as of 1974., NASA On its path to bizjet ubiquity, the Learjet soon became the choice of many of the rich and famous . Frank Sinatra traded his French-made Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris Jet for a brand-new Learjet 23 in 1965. He lent the jet to Elvis Presley when he and Priscilla Beaulieu flew to Las Vegas to marry, in 1967. The same plane also flew Sammy Davis Jr and Marlon Brando to Mississippi to join Martin Luther King Jr on a freedom march. Ultimately, so great was the cultural capital enjoyed by the Learjet that, by the early 1980s, the company itself claimed its aircraft had appeared in more movies and TV shows than any other aircraft in history. Whether or not that is true, it has certainly enjoyed its fair share of iconic moments, including the final montage scene of Mad Men : In 1966 the Lear Jet Corporation was taken over by the Gates Rubber Company, becoming Gates Learjet Corp. The same year saw the appearance of the stretched Learjet 25, with seating for 10 in a cabin that was 50 percent bigger, and slightly reduced range. Next came the Learjet 28 and the Learjet 29 Longhorn, only a few of which were produced, but they were the first in the family to add winglets for improved efficiency. Now a familiar feature on many commercial designs, the NASA-developed winglets were first employed on these aircraft. Between 1964 and 1982, 105 Learjet 23s, 255 Learjet 24s, and 368 Learjet 25s were delivered. The Learjet 28 and 29 were the first production bizjets to feature winglets. , NASA With the eight-seat Learjet 35 unveiled in 1973, customers could now receive all the benefits of more economical and quieter Garrett TFE731 turbofan engines, superseding the previous turbojets. The six-seat Learjet 36 was offered alongside it, and both featured slightly larger wings and a slight fuselage stretch. The Learjet 35 also became a firm favorite for the U.S. Air Force, which acquired it under the military designation C-21. Meanwhile, it was a Learjet 36 that golfer Arnold Palmer used to set a new round-the-world record in 1976, covering a distance of 22,984 miles in 57 hours 25 minutes, and 42 seconds. By the time production ceased in the mid-1990s, over 730 examples of the Learjet 35/36 had been sold. A C-21 — a U.S. Air Force Learjet 35 — operated by the Connecticut Air National Guard., Tomás Del Coro/Wikimedia Commons In the meantime, the 10-seat Learjet 55 had been added to the family, together with the seven-seat, long-range Learjet 55LR, the even longer-range Learjet 55XLR, and the Learjet 55B with a modern glass cockpit, introduced in 1986. This series was the first in which the passengers could stand up in the cabin and it also added characteristic downward-sloping “delta fins” on the rear fuselage. A total of 147 of the different Learjet 55 models were built until 1992. A privately operated Learjet 55 in Las Vegas, Nevada. , Eddie Maloney/Wikimedia Commons It was in 1990 that Bombardier acquired the Learjet line after Gates had begun to run into financial difficulties. The acquisition initially saw the bizjets built under the Learjet Inc. brand, and the new Canadian owner launched a whole new range of designs to ensure success in the 1990s and beyond. The Learjet 31 combined the wing of the Learjet 55 with the eight-seat Learjet 35 fuselage and was the first of the “next-generation” Learjets. By the time the Learjet 31A was on the scene in 1991, the bizjet now had a fully integrated Bendix/King Electronic Flight Instrumentation System with five screens in the cockpit and a maximum speed of Mach 0.81.

With that in mind, Bombardier has announced a remanufacturing program for Learjet 40 and Learjet 45 aircraft, known as Learjet RACER. This is also part of the company’s increased focus on providing services for existing customers. The Learjet is also likely to see many more years of service in the hands of contractors providing services to different armed forces around the world, with the Learjet having established itself, in particular, as a popular choice for adversary air support , including electronic warfare and target towing . Other examples are still going strong on radar mapping duties, and have even been used as air show performers . https://youtube.com/watch?v=GDUUTmuO1AU The RACER process will include enhancements to the interior and exterior components, advanced avionics, high-speed connectivity, improved engines, and reduced maintenance costs. “The site will be busy,” Martel told reporters. “Wichita will remain a prime site for Bombardier.” That welcome decision should also help keep the remaining workforce in Wichita busy, as they continue to keep work on the many existing Learjet aircraft that remain in use in North America and beyond.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Feb 4, 2021",A Group Of Israelis Secretly Built And Tested Suicide Drones For An Unknown Asian Customer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A group of more than 20 Israelis, among them former defense officials, are under investigation for allegedly illegally designing, producing, and selling “armed loitering missiles,” also known as “suicide drones,” to an unnamed Asian country. The news comes less than two weeks after the announcement of three legitimate sales of these kinds of weapons by the Israeli arms industry, including to unnamed Asian countries. The Israeli Police today confirmed the investigation, which has been run “in recent months” in cooperation with the country’s Shin Bet state security service. In a statement posted on Twitter, the Israeli Police explained that the suspects had secretly received instructions “from entities related to the same country,” in exchange for “considerable funds” paid to them, as well as other undisclosed benefits. The investigation was conducted by the Unit for International Crime Investigations, part of the Police’s Lahav 433 division, which is otherwise primarily responsible for investigating national crimes and corruption. As already noted, Shin Bet was also involved, as was Israel’s National Security Council. The rogue loitering munitions under construction in an Israeli workshop., via Twitter “The Israelis are suspected of national security offenses, breaching arms exports laws, money laundering and other financial offenses,” the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported . “The investigation continues. The details of the investigation and the identities of the suspects are under a gag order.” The alleged crimes include offenses against the security of the state, violations of the law on the supervision of security exports, money laundering, and other economic offenses. “This case illustrates the potential damage to the security of the country due to illegal deals conducted by Israeli citizens with foreign entities,” said a spokesperson for Shin Bet, as reported in the Jerusalem Post . “It also raises fears that technology will get into the hands of enemy countries,” they added. Israel has sought to increase the regulation around its defense exports in recent years, with the aim of preventing companies from knowingly selling weapons to countries that have committed severe human rights violations. Under the Law For Oversight of Defense Exports , the Israeli Ministry of Defense must consult with the Foreign Ministry in all weapons sales to foreign countries, weighing up the potential impact on foreign policy and diplomatic relations. Since the law was passed in 2007, the Foreign Ministry has much greater power to veto arms transfers, although they, in turn, can be overruled by the government’s security cabinet. Ironically, in light of the current case, this regulation was introduced, in part, due to the planned sale of intelligence-gathering drones to China, which was eventually canceled due to pressure from the United States. The Israeli Police have released video and photos of the loitering munitions. A brief video clip, with two timestamps showing August and November 2019, shows one of the weapons being tested, with several individuals gathered beside two cars before it’s launched, almost vertically. The Times of Israel reports that the Police confirmed this test took place “near a residential area” in the center of the country. Broadly speaking, suicide drones have the advantages of being small, maneuverable, and hard to detect, as well as being relatively inexpensive. Even a relatively basic loitering munition, offering a man-in-the-loop control system would provide a very useful weapon in many scenarios, especially in asymmetric warfare. Other benefits of these kinds of weapons include the ability for the operator to abort the strike, even at the very last moment, or make manual adjustments to improve accuracy. Generally, suicide drones are very precise while also providing additional means to help avoid collateral damage, capabilities you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone piece . While the loitering munition in question appears to have been launched initially using a rocket motor, a photo showing the drones being manufactured in a workshop reveals that it also seems to have a propeller at the rear, for the cruise phase of its flight. The drone itself has a tubular body with large cruciform center-body wings, plus smaller cruciform fins at the tail end. Overall, the drone seems to be broadly reminiscent of an Israeli guided missile, the SPIKE-NLOS , produced by Rafael, although this doesn’t use a propeller engine. A tripod mounting what appears to be a control link for operating the drones., via Twitter It is not known what guidance system the drone used. Typically, these kinds of weapons can use a man-in-the-loop control system that allows their human operator to see what the drone sees, via a set of electro-optical and/or infrared video cameras, throughout the entire course of its flight. The more sophisticated models now available offer a degree of autonomy, with the ability to automatically detect, categorize, and track various types of targets. Increasingly common are operating modes in which the drones can proceed to strike the desired targets without any further need for human input. While it’s unclear whether these more advanced guidance methods were available to the individuals responsible for building these illicit drones, the fact that former defense officials were involved in the plot suggests that they may at least have a significant understanding of these technologies. This ruggedized laptop seems to have been used to launch and control the drones., via Twitter Israel is notably already one of the main developers of loitering munitions, or suicide drones, including the Harop that was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Less than two weeks ago , The War Zone reported about how the maritime version of that weapon had recently secured what was apparently its first order, from another unnamed Asian country. The navalized Harop sale was announced alongside a deal with “another customer in Asia” for standard ground-launched versions of that weapon and a sale of IAI’s rotary-winged loitering munition Rotem to a different “foreign country.” It’s no exaggeration to say that Israel essentially pioneered the concept of loitering munitions, inspired by its early use of drones to help destroy and confuse hostile air defenses during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. In the conflicts that followed, Israel refined its use of drones to help overwhelm air defense batteries, as well as for surveillance. Drones intended for such high-risk missions became increasingly expendable, leading to the Harpy, which was intended to loiter and then home in on threat radar frequencies, destroying the air defense systems itself. As perhaps the first “loitering munition,” the Harpy is the ancestor of today’s Harop, and you can read more about it here . Of course, it is in the interests of some countries to obscure the details of arms transfers from Israel, in the case of legitimate sales. Political sensitivities are often the reason for Israeli arms deals with international customers being little-publicized by either party, the recent Harop and Rotem sales perhaps being a case in point. Meanwhile, in the case of the illicit loitering munitions, there is a suggestion that the political ramifications could be significant, too. “Sources with knowledge of the investigation said the case was highly sensitive, as it could affect Israel’s foreign relations and lead to a rift between superpowers,” tweeted the editor of the English-language edition of Haaretz , Avi Scharf . A cable spool was among the equipment that was apparently confiscated., via Twitter Loitering munitions, in general, have been a topic of major international discussion since Azerbaijan used ground-launched Harops to decisive effect in its conflict with Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region last year. You can read more about this fighting, and the role that drones played in it, in our previous reporting on that conflict . In this context, it is also worth noting that one Israeli company has previously run into trouble in connection with its involvement in an incident in Nagorno-Karabakh back in 2017. That year, Aeronautics Limited was accused of fraud and violating the country’s export controls for military equipment. This was reportedly the result of an incident in Azerbaijan in which executives from the company “demonstrated” the capabilities of their Orbiter 1K suicide drone by flying a very real strike on Armenian-backed forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. You can read all about that here . The fact that a fairly small group of individuals can also construct and test, in secret, an apparently functioning loitering munition should also provide pause for thought for the nations around the world that face a potential threat from militia groups or terror organizations. Following their use in the conflict in Yemen , the proliferation of these kinds of weapons in the hands of other non-state actors would seem to be just a matter of time. Until we know the intended customer of these illegally produced drones, it is difficult to know exactly what kind of scenario they were intended to be used in. However, it seems safe to say that the performance of Israeli-made loitering munitions in last year’s Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has helped make these kinds of weapons something of a “must-have” among armed forces around the world.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain very limited at this time, but it is clear a Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) test has occurred over the Atlantic ocean. According to a series of notices to airman (NOTAM) about the potential launch activity that were posted in recent days, the missile was launched off the Florida coast and had a reentry area to the east of Ascension Island, with a total downrange travel distance of around 5,200 miles.Â The launch grabbed the attention of Floridians who saw the Trident missile’s comet-like trail lit up in the evening sky. These tests are essential to guaranteeing America and Britain’s second-strike capability that underpins both country’s nuclear deterrents. It is unclear at this time if the launch emanated from a U.S. Navy or U.K. Royal Navy nuclear ballistic missile submarine. Looks like a potential #Trident -II #SLBM test is upcoming in the Atlantic between Feb 9 and 14. Range ~8400 km.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 11, 2021",Navy Finally Confirms Its Trident Missile Test Was What People Saw Off Florida This Week,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has officially confirmed that it carried out a test of a Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile over the Atlantic Ocean earlier this week. An Ohio class ballistic missile submarine , or SSBN, fired the weapon, which did not carry any live nuclear warheads, from within the service’s Eastern Range off the coast of Florida, which had quickly grabbed the attention of locals, as you can read about in The War Zone ‘s initial reporting . The Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) office provided additional details about the test to The War Zone in a statement on Feb. 10, 2021. SSP oversees the development, acquisition, and sustainment of strategic weapons systems, including the Trident D5 and the Ohio class submarines that presently carry them, as well as work on the future Columbia class ballistic missile submarines. The service did not name the particular submarine that fired the missile. A Trident D5 missile seen in an earlier test., USN “Navy Strategic Systems Programs conducted a scheduled Trident II (D5) missile test flight at sea from an Ohio Class SSBN, in the Eastern Range off the east coast of Florida, on February 9th, 2021,” Jeff Fatora, an SSP spokesperson, said. “This test was part of a scheduled, ongoing system evaluation test.” “Launches are conducted on a frequent, recurring basis to ensure the continued reliability of the system. Each test activity provides valuable information about our systems, thus contributing to assurance in our capabilities,” he continued. “Test missiles are not armed, and Strategic Systems Programs does not routinely announce missile testing. Information regarding the test launch of Trident II (D5) missiles is classified before the launch.” It’s certainly true that Trident test launches occur regularly, but the Navy does proactively issue press releases regarding them, as well. It certainly seems curious that the Navy did not even issue a simple confirmation quickly after it became clear that the test had caught public attention, especially in Florida, where the comet-like trail had sparked reports of UFOs . Publicly available notices to airmen (NOTAM) had already outlined areas where parts of a missile were expected to fall on Feb. 9, which aligned almost perfectly with previous Atlantic Trident test launches. This includes a spectacularly failed launch in 2016 from a Vanguard class ballistic missile submarine belonging to the U.K. Royal Navy, which also fields Trident D5s as part of an arrangement with the United States. In that instance, the missile reportedly flew in the completely wrong direction and was self-destructed in midair after it looked to be heading toward Florida proper. It was not initially clear which Navy had fired the missile in this most recent test. However, when The War Zone contacted the Navy’s office of the Chief of Information (CHINFO), the service’s top public affairs office, yesterday, we were initially redirected to the U.S. Army for unclear reasons. “Army Futures Command Future Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team is currently participating in a Spike Non-Line-of-Sight [Spike-NLOS] Missile experimentation in Florida,” Robyn Mack, the Public Affairs Chief for Army Futures Command, told us. “The tests are part of our Project Convergence campaign of learning designed to inform, develop, and integrate an interoperable Joint Force that is capable of multi-domain operations at echelon.” Mack also said that an overwater test of the Spike-NLOS missile had occurred earlier this week. What was observed in flight off the Florida coast was clearly not this missile, though, which is a much smaller and shorter-range weapon than a Trident. The Army is working toward fielding Spike-NLOS as a new extended-range weapon for current and future helicopters. The War Zone was subsequently directed to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and, from there, to SSP. In the end, there is no indication, whatsoever, that the Army was in any way involved in this Trident D5 test. As for what the purpose of this Trident D5 “system evaluation test” was, it remains unclear. There is a need, as SSP’s Fatora said, to regularly conduct tests of these missiles to ensure their continued reliability and to demonstrate that capability in a way that potential adversaries can see, at least to some degree, to help maintain deterrence. There may be an additional need to conduct end-to-end tests of Trident D5s that reflect the introduction of the new W76-2 low-yield warhead for those missiles, the last examples of which were delivered to the Navy in 2020. The W76-2 program has been a contentious and controversial issue. Proponents argue that they provide essential flexibility to deter a lower-tier of threats than could be responded to with existing warheads, while critics have raised fears they only lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in a future conflict. You can read more about these nuclear weapons, which President Joe Biden has previously called a “bad idea,” and the issues surrounding them in this past War Zone piece . The official W76-2 program logo. Mk 4A refers to the reentry vehicle inside which the warhead sits., NNSA An improved version of the W88 warhead, also used on the Trident D5s, is in development, as well, though that work has suffered delays in the past few years. Last year, the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees U.S. nuclear weapon development, also revealed that it had started developing a new warhead for the Tridents, called the W93 . If it does ultimately enter service, the W93 looks set to be the first entirely new warhead design to enter the U.S. nuclear stockpile since the first W88s were delivered in 1989. Ohio class submarines have also been involved in the testing of new hypersonic weapons , including a design the Navy is developing together with the Army . This latest Trident test also notably comes after the United States and Russia agreed to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) through 2026. That agreement places limits on the strategic arsenals of both countries, including provisions that impact how many submarine-launched ballistic missiles each country can have and how many individual warheads each of those weapons can hold. Each Trident D5 can hold up to 14 warheads, but they are typically only loaded with five or six at a time due to New START, as well as preceding arms control deals with Russia. Whatever the case, we now know for sure that what people saw flying over the Atlantic off the coast of Florida earlier this week was a Trident missile fired from a Navy submarine.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 20, 2021",DARPA Is Developing Aircraft-Launched Missile-Like Drones That Fire Their Own Air-To-Air Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has hired General Atomics , Lockheed Martin , and Northrop Grumman , to craft designs for an air-launched missile-toting air-to-air combat drone as part of a program called LongShot . In concept, a larger manned aircraft would fire this unmanned air vehicle, which could then fly to a certain area and engage multiple aerial threats with its own weapons. This, in turn, would extend the range of the launch platform and reduce its vulnerability to hostile aircraft or air defenses, among many other benefits. DARPA announced the contract awards , the value of which has not yet been disclosed, on Feb. 8, 2021. Plans for LongShot had emerged last year in the Pentagon’s budget request for the 2021 Fiscal Year, which asked for $22 million, in total, to conduct initial work, including the development and refinement of the design for a “demonstration system.” That same request also included $13.27 million for a proposed gun-armed air-launched drone effort called Gunslinger, which you can read more about in this past War Zone story . DARPA LongShot program aims to create a novel alternative to traditional air-to-air missiles, such as the AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) seen here, that offers longer range and other additional capabilities., USAF “The LongShot program changes the paradigm of air combat operations by demonstrating an unmanned, air-launched vehicle capable of employing current and advanced air-to-air weapons,” Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Paul Calhoun, the LongShot program manager, said in a statement. “LongShot will disrupt traditional incremental weapon improvements by providing an alternative means of generating combat capability.” At its most basic, the idea behind LongShot is to put extra distance between the launching aircraft and the aerial threat or threats it is targeting. This increases the range at which those targets can be engaged, which also allows the launch platform to stay further away, potentially outside of the range of counterattack. The benefits of this additional range are pretty clear cut. The U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy are presently working together on a new long-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-260, which you can read about more in this War Zone piece , as a more traditional way of extending the reach of combat aircraft in aerial engagements. However, unlike just any very-long-range air-to-air missile, LongShot offers a way to engage targets at greater distances, but only actually firing a missile much closer to the target, when the missile’s energy state will still be high. The idea is that this would give the enemy much less time to react or the ability to evade, increasing the likelihood of a kill. Though not specifically mentioned in DARPA’s discussions of the program so far, this system would also enable a single launching aircraft to engage threats from multiple vectors at once, making it even more difficult for opponents to survive an attack. “An air system using multi-modal propulsion could capitalize upon a slower speed, higher fuel-efficient air vehicle for ingress, while retaining highly energetic air-to-air missiles for endgame target engagements,” the entry for LongShot in the Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal further explained. “First, the weapon system will have a much-increased range over their legacy counterparts for transit to an engagement zone. Second, launching air-to-air missiles closer to the adversary increases energy in terminal flight, reduces reaction time, and increases probability of kill.” The entry of LongShot from the Pentagon’s 2021 Fiscal Year budget request., DOD If the LongShot vehicle is a stealthy design that is hard to detect, to begin with, and can be cued to the target area via an offboard platform or platforms using hard to detect low-probability of intercept data links , there is an even greater chance of the system effectively ambushing the threat or threats. Using a non-LPI/LPD data link, such as one using the popular Link 16 waveform , that goes into receive-only mode after a certain point in the flight, could also be a less complex way to keep the system “silent” in the electromagnetic spectrum. With sufficiently robust networking capabilities, the drone itself would not need to carry any complex sensors to track targets and engage targets. DARPA’s LongShot concept art, seen at the top of this story, shows a stealthy cruise missile-like vehicle, with pop-out fins and rear-mounted air-breathing engine, firing two smaller air-to-air missiles. The concept art also shows a panel falling away, which appears to keep the LongShot’s internal weapons bay sealed until the moment of launch. This would help keep the unmanned aircraft in its most stealthy and efficient configuration until the last possible moment. It’s interesting to note that the air-to-air missiles in the concept art appear to be examples of Lockheed Martin’s Cuda design , development of which has been long-dormant now, at least publicly. Described as a “hit-to-kill” weapon that would destroy its target by physically slamming into it instead of using a traditional explosive warhead, Cuda first emerged in the early 2010s , before effectively disappearing from the company’s marketing materials by the end of the decade. It’s not clear if this artwork is meant to reflect Lockheed Martin’s proposal, specifically. An artist’s conception of the Cuda missile., Lockheed Martin Cuda is, of course, not the only small form-factor air-to-air missile that has been in development since then, either. In 2019, Raytheon unveiled its Peregrine miniature air-to-air missile and the Air Force itself has been working on other potential designs through the Small Advanced Capability Missile (SACM) and Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM) programs. Both missiles are extremely agile by design. Regardless, LongShot, combined with a smaller missile, such as Cuda, could offer expanded magazine capacity while also dramatically expanding range, as well. The drone could potentially also be able to do things a long-range missile cannot, like loiter in an area for a prolonged period of time. In doing so, the maximum use of advanced fighters’ ever farther-reaching sensors could be fully leveraged, and a single fighter could put up a combat air patrol in multiple places at one time. With all of this combined, LongShot sounds like it could be particularly valuable for keeping older, non-stealthy, fourth-generation jets relevant as adversaries, especially near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China , continue to develop increasingly more advanced combat aircraft , as well as longer-range air-to-air weapons and air defense systems . Larger designs, such as the Air Force’s forthcoming F-15EXs , could leverage their greater payload capacity , especially compared to stealthy fighters , to further maximize the benefits that this kind of missile-armed drone might provide. An artist’s conception showing F-15EX jets carrying 10 AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and two AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles., Boeing In addition, a bomber-sized aircraft carrying a large number of these missile-laden drones could be a particularly potent combination. The Air Force itself has already suggested that its sixth-generation “fighter jet” could actually turn out to be something like a variant of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber loaded with air-to-air missiles and working together with smaller “loyal wingman” type unmanned aircraft. There’s also no particular reason why an advanced and fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) couldn’t also launch LongShots. The Air Force, as well as the Navy, have already conducted significant UCAV development work in cooperation with companies, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, but these kinds of unmanned aircraft continue to be described vaguely as potential components of aerial fleets at some unspecified time in the future. This curious lack of active UCAV programs, at least publicly, is something The War Zone has explored in detail in the past. From the very beginning, DARPA’s LongShot effort has also felt like an extension of a curious Flying Missile Rail (FMR) program that it initiated in 2017. That project had many of the same general objectives, but also had a heavy focus on exploring advanced manufacturing and rapid prototyping concepts to help reduce the FMR’s developmental and production costs. You can read more about that program in this past War Zone piece . The cost factors would also be important for LongShot, since the vehicle being overly complex and expensive could easily undermine any benefits it might offer. These same issues apply to the development of other systems intended to be fielded in large numbers , such as swarming drones and munitions , where significant cost growth might render an entire concept impractical to employ on any useful scale. It’s not clear whether DARPA intends for the LongShot vehicle to be recoverable and/or reusable in any way under any circumstances. A heavily networked design could help keep costs low by eliminating the need for these drones to carry costly sensors themselves, relying instead on off-board platforms for that targeting information. “In later phases of the program, LongShot will construct and fly a full-scale air-launched demonstration system capable of controlled flight, before, during, and after weapon ejection under operational conditions,” DARPA did say in its press release. All told, it will be very interesting to learn more about the prospective LongShot designs and see how DARPA refines the proposed concepts of operation surrounding this novel air-to-air combat system in the coming months.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A rare picture has emerged of what is almost certainly the lone UH-60N helicopter assigned to Marine Helicopter Squadron One’s “green top” fleet, which also includes a dozen MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors . This unit, abbreviated HMX-1, is better known for its “white top” fleet that provides the “Marine One” VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters that move the president, their family, and their closest advisors around at home and abroad. HMX-1 is in the early stages of replacing those helicopters with new VH-92As, which you can read more about in these past War Zone pieces . Twitter user @holy_itsViper grabbed a picture of this helicopter flying over Washington, D.C., on Feb. 9, 2021, and was kind enough to share it with us. HMX-1’s main base of operations is at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia, but it also has a detachment at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in the nation’s capital. The squadron’s helicopters also routinely fly to and from the White House , the Pentagon, and the U.S. Naval Observatory , the latter location being where the Vice President’s residence is situated. One of HMX-1’s more commonly seen VH-60N helicopters at Osan Air Base in South Korea in 2014 during then-President Barack Obama’s visit to that country. a VC-25A Air Force One jet is seen in the background., USAF This helicopter appears to have arrived at HMX-1 sometime between 2015 and 2016, based on annual Marine Aviation Plan reports . It was also confirmed to still be part of the squadron in a report on noise from helicopters operating in the greater Washington area that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog, published in January of this year. None of these reports have included any pictures of the UH-60N or provided detailed descriptions of what its exact roles and missions might be, but The War Zone has already reached out to the Marine Corps for more information. If this helicopter is the UH-60N, it appears to have only the most general relationship to the heavily-modified VH-60N “Marine One” helicopters, which have robust communications suites, extensive countermeasures , and other systems necessary to meet the needs of the President and other VVIPs. Externally, the green top helicopter appears to share much more with the MH-60S Seahawk , and it may even be a derivative thereof. The MH-60S, originally designated the CH-60S and also known colloquially as the Knighthawk, is a hybrid of sorts between the U.S. Army’s UH-60L Black Hawk and earlier U.S. Navy Seahawk variants . MH-60S helicopters can be readily identified by a distinct protrusion under the nose, where a turret containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras can be mounted, something also seen on this apparent UH-60N. A breakdown of the components on the MH-60S that show what comes straight from earlier Black Hawk and Seahawk variants, as well as what is new to this particular version., via GlobalSecurity.org A Navy MH-60S helicopter with the distinctive protrusion under the nose visible., USN While we don’t know how HMX-1 utilizes its UH-60N, we do know that the squadron’s green top fleet, as a whole, primarily provides a lower-tier of support for presidential missions by moving around White House staff, members of the media, specialized quick reaction teams , Secret Service personnel , and other official guests. It’s worth noting that the MV-22s that now make up the bulk of the green top fleet had replaced the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters that the squadron had previously operated. Those tiltrotors also helped fill the gap left by the earlier retirement of the squadron’s CH-53D/E Sea Stallions . The MH-60Ss supplanted H-46 variants when they entered service with the Navy, as well. A “green top” MV-22 Osprey assigned to HMX-1., USMC An HMX-1 CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter. The MV-22s replaced this type., Andy Rusch via Wikimedia So, it’s certainly possible that the UH-60N, which looks, as its designation implies, to be configured for general utility missions, could provide useful additional capacity for HMX-1’s green side. This helicopter would have the benefit of being able to operate from landing spaces too small to safely accommodate the much larger MV-22s and the powerful downwash from their rotors. Flying tree branches and other debris kicked up by an MV-22 injured 10 people during a demonstration on Memorial Day in 2010 in Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island in New York City. However, the UH-60N’s main job appears to be as a training platform for crews destined to fly HMX-1’s white top VH-60Ns. Marine Aviation Plans initially referred to it as a “TH-60N.” HMX-1 faces a significant and unique training bottleneck due to the fact that the white side of the unit is so security-sensitive that its helicopters are literally caged off from the others. It can take up to a year for aviators and other personnel to get the necessary security clearances to work in those spaces, let alone fly those aircraft. Having a similar, but largely unclassified airframe offers pilots and ground crews a way to get started on any necessary training while the clearance process is still ongoing. HMX-1 also acquired a Sea King helicopter, initially referred to as a TH-3D and then later described as a UH-3D, around the same time as it got the UH-60N, for the same general reasons. This UH-3D should not be confused with the NVH-3A Marine One test helicopter that Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 21 (HX-21) finally retired last year , which also wore a green top paint scheme. A page from the Marine Aviation Plan from 2015, which mentions the expected delivery of the TH-60N, as well as TH-3D, in the early part of that year., USMC HMX-1 is already in the process of acquiring a small fleet of CH-92As that will primarily provide similar training support for its new VH-92As. Of course, none of this is to say that the UH-60N couldn’t still be employed in non-training roles, if necessary. The “U” designation rather than “T” one would suggest the squadron views it as a more general-purpose airframe. However HMX-1 employs this helicopter, it already appears to be in the twilight of its relatively short service with the squadron. As of 2019, the plan was to divest it in the middle of 2022 as part of the transition on the white side from the VH-3Ds and VH-60Ns to the VH-92As. A pair of VH-92A helicopters fly in formation., Blend Qatipi No matter what, it’s very interesting to see this extremely camera shy member of one of the Marine Corps’ most well-known aviation units.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Yemen’s Houthi Rebels Strike Airliner In New Drone Attack On Saudi Airport,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A civilian aircraft was reportedly left burning after a drone attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on an airport in southern Saudi Arabia today. Saudi authorities say the fire at Abha International Airport in the province of Asir is now under control but there have been no mentions of casualties so far. The attack comes less than a week after President Joe Biden’s Administration halted support for Saudi-led offensive operations against the Houthis. The State Department also subsequently removed the militant group from the list of U.S. government-designated Foreign Terrorist Groups, where it had been placed right at the end of former President Donald Trump’s tenure in January. A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the Houthis since 2015 in support of Yemen’s internationally-recognized government. A satellite image of Abha International Airport., GOOGLE EARTH “A cowardly criminal terrorist attack launched against Abha International Airport in Saudi Arabia by the Houthi militia,” state-run Al-Ekhbariya television cited the Saudi-led anti-Houthi coalition as saying . “The attempt to target Abha Airport is a war crime and put civilian travelers’ lives in danger,” the coalition added . Photos on social media apparently show damage to at least one aircraft at the airport, an Airbus A320 operated by the Saudi airline Flyadeal , which was on the ground at the time of the attack, although it’s not clear if this is the aircraft that was reportedly on fire. A Houthi spokesman confirmed via Twitter the targeting of Abha International Airport and said that a total of four Samad-3 and Qasef-2K suicide drones had been used. According to the Yemeni Armed Forces, the Sammad-3 has a range of between 930 and 1,050 miles. In terms of appearance, the Qasef-2K is reportedly identical to the previous Qasef-1, which seems to be the Houthi name for the Iranian Ababil unmanned aerial vehicle. The Qasef-1 has a reported maximum range of 124 miles. Ahead of today’s attack, the Saudi-led coalition said that it had intercepted two “booby trap” drones in the south of the country. The Iran-backed Houthis have an expansive arsenal of cruise and ballistic missiles and suicide drones , as well as other indirect-fire weapons. The latest attack at Abha International suggests the Houthis are continuing a high tempo of cross-border operations against Saudi Arabia. The militant group has undertaken drone and missile strikes against targets in Saudi Arabia on multiple occasions in the past few years and last December, apparently for the first time, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh issued an alert warning of a possible missile or drone strike headed toward the capital. In 2019, the Houthis claimed to have struck Saudi oil infrastructure , reportedly using Iranian-supplied drones and cruise missiles, and there have also been successive attacks on tankers in the Red Sea, most recently in December . For its part, Abha International Airport is located around 75 miles from the Yemeni border and has come under attack before. The location of Abha International Airport in relation to the wider region., GOOGLE EARTH On June 12, 2019 , a Houthi projectile struck the arrival area at Abha International, injuring 26 civilians. Later that month, on June 23, another attack left one dead and 21 injured. On that occasion, the Saudi-led coalition said that drones had been launched from the Sanaa Governorate in Yemen. The airport was struck again by missiles on July 2, 2019, leaving nine injured. Most recently, a Houthi attack against Abha International was thwarted, on August 31, 2020, when an explosives-laden drone was intercepted , together with a remotely controlled boat in the Red Sea, that was also prepared for a separate attack. Some debris from the destroyed drone landed at the airport, but no injuries or damage were reported. The Houthis were designated as a terrorist group in the final days of the Trump Administration, in view of their links to Iran , as well as the attack on Yemen’s Aden International Airport last December. This attack involved multiple projectiles and killed 26. Since taking office, however, President Biden has moved to delist the Houthis as a terrorist group. This is intended to make it easier to deliver aid to Yemen, where civil war has led to a situation the United Nations describes as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. At the same time, Biden has announced an end to direct Saudi support for its offensive operations in Yemen. The Pentagon will also terminate its previous provision of “some limited non-combat assistance for coalition operations,” including intelligence, although it “will remain a partner in terms of combating terror in the region.” Also off the agenda, for now, are further deliveries of certain weapons to Saudi Arabia, including a deal worth up to $760 million and covering as many as 10,000 precision-guided munitions that had been agreed at the end of the Trump Administration. The arms package included 3,000 Boeing GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs and 7,000 Raytheon Paveway IV smart bombs. Both those sales are now on indefinite hold. A Saudi soldier from the First Airborne Brigade talks with an Emirati soldier in Yemen., Saudi88hawk/Wikimedia Commons However, critics of the Biden Administration have said that decision will only embolden the Houthis and their Iranian benefactors. “This decision has nothing to do with our view of the Houthis and their reprehensible conduct, including attacks against civilians and the kidnapping of American citizens,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said . “Our action is due entirely to the humanitarian consequences of this last-minute designation from the prior administration,” they added. Biden’s decision to end U.S. support for Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen follows his announcement of a broader new policy toward the Middle East, including a more nuanced approach to the Gulf monarchies. Biden has also referred explicitly to the conflict in Yemen, which has seen more than 100,000 Yemenis killed and four million displaced, according to the Council for Foreign Relations , leading to a “humanitarian and strategic catastrophe”. “This war has to end,” Biden said . “And to underscore our commitment, we’re ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales.” The results of an airstrike on a neighborhood in Sanaa, the largest city in Yemen, in 2015., Almigdad Mojalli/VOA However, the United States will continue to provide defensive support to Saudi Arabia, including against missile and drone attacks such as those prosecuted by the Houthis. As well as attacking objectives within Saudi Arabia, the Houthis have also stepped up their campaign in Yemen, with a renewed offensive to take control of the Yemeni government’s last northern stronghold of Marib. The group already controls much of the north of the country. Making things yet more difficult is the fact that the Saudi-backed factions involved in the conflict in Yemen also regularly compete among themselves, with that friction sometimes escalating into open violence. The officials targeted at Aden International Airport last year were actually returning from Saudi Arabia after a power-sharing arrangement was brokered in Riyadh to halt fighting between two major anti-Houthi Yemeni groups. Clearly, the Biden Administration is now trying to reframe its approach to the ongoing crisis in Yemen and provide space for humanitarian aid and a negotiated settlement. However, if the Houthis keep up their attacks on Saudi Arabia, it could also put pressure on the United States to adopt a harder line once again.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Veteran Submariners Explain What Might Have Caused Japanese Submarine Collision,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since our initial report on the collision between the Japanese submarine Soryu and a cargo ship in the Pacific Ocean yesterday, The War Zone has heard a number of interesting theories as to what happened, including from veteran submariners. To get a better understanding of what might have gone wrong during this routine exercise in the waters off the island of Shikoku, we spoke to a former U.S. Navy officer who served aboard submarines extensively and who also worked as a navigation safety instructor. We also asked the opinion of our friend and contributor, Aaron Amick , a veteran sonarman with two decades of experience aboard U.S. Navy submarines. For the purpose of this article, our first source prefers to keep their identity anonymous. While we don’t know exactly what happened yet, the scenarios they present provide a fascinating insight into the tricky world of underwater operations from someone whose day-to-day job involved “sub driving.” Soryu after the accident., Japan Coast Guard First, a recap of what we know happened. Yesterday, at 10:58 AM local time, around 25 miles southeast of Cape Ashizuri, off the island of Shikoku, which lies southwest of Japan’s main island of Honshu, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s (JMSDF) diesel-electric submarine Soryu collided with the bulk carrier Ocean Artemis . The cargo vessel had departed the Chinese city of Qingdao last Friday and was bound for Okayama Prefecture in western Japan. With 51,000 gross tons and a length of 750 feet, the Ocean Artemis is registered in Hong Kong and was transporting iron ore. For comparison, the submarine has a surfaced displacement of approximately 2,900 tons and a length of just over 275 feet. Reports state that the collision resulted in injuries to at least three submariners. Initially, the Japanese Ministry of Defense described the damage to the Soryu as limited to masts housing a periscope and a communication antenna. However, photos that have since emerged reveal more considerable damage, including to its dive planes, the starboard one of which is almost broken in two. There also appears to be rather more severe damage to the top of the sail itself, with a number of anechoic tiles missing. Our submariner source pointed out that automatic identification system (AIS) data — a tracking system that provides logs of vessels’ movements — shows that the Ocean Artemis was heading in a northerly direction and was making between 7.7 and 11.1 knots when it collided with the Soryu . All this information can be gleaned from open sources, including the Marine Traffic website . Looking at the available evidence, the same source thinks it plausible that the Soryu was submerged, but at a shallow depth. However, the submarine was far enough below the surface to make it impossible to use the periscope. Had the submarine been at periscope depth, it would have been hard to miss a bulk carrier like the Ocean Artemis visually, unless the periscope operator was completely negligent, since it was broad daylight and the weather was fairly good. JAPAN COAST GUARD The submariner notes that it looks like the periscope on Soryu is fully raised, suggesting that it did not directly impact the hull of the container ship. This leads to the assumption that the periscope could have been lowered at the time (or otherwise missed the hull). “Otherwise, it would be bent out of shape or sheered off completely (which may be true, because submarines tend to come with two periscopes for redundancy). Again, it is hard to say for sure, but if they were at periscope depth in broad daylight, they ought to have seen the container ship,” they explained. In the opinion of our source, Ocean Artemis possibly came up from behind in the baffles — traditionally the sonar “blind spot” behind a submarine made famous during the “Crazy Ivan” set-piece sequence in The Hunt For Red October . Two different factors could have combined to ensure the submarine was not able to see the cargo ship. Firstly, the towed sonar array that could be used to detect the vessel above and behind would have been retracted, which is required in order for the submarine to surface. Second, the submarine has no aft-looking hull-mounted sonar, thus requiring frequent baffle clears — turns to “hear” behind the submarine using forward and side sonar arrays . With the submarine most likely heading in a northerly direction, the forward-looking and flank array sonars would have been biased toward the areas with the highest amount of surface traffic. This means the safety-of-ship sensors prioritize the areas with the most hazards, not out to the open ocean, which would not have helped with the Ocean Artemis probably bearing down on the submarine from the rear. JAPAN COAST GUARD Coupled with that, having a big cargo ship like the Ocean Artemis approaching from the rear is also the worst case for hydrodynamic forces — Soryu might simply have been sucked up into the ship’s hull due to the Venturi effect . This is not an unknown phenomenon, by any means, and the same thing happened to the Los Angele s class nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Newport News in the south of the Strait of Hormuz in 2007. On that occasion, the submarine was pulled up and into the hull of the Japanese tanker Mogamigawa. The Newport News sustained damage to its bow and the commanding officer was relieved of their command. The former U.S. Navy submariner also identified certain human factors that could have played a contributing role. The crew of the Soryu may have been fatigued or stressed, or there may have been overconfidence in their abilities, leading to complacency. In the demanding operational environment aboard a submarine, one highly stressful event may have led to a reduction in situational awareness. “These three behavioral characteristics are common in crews post-exercise,” the source notes. JAPAN COAST GUARD JAPAN COAST GUARD There is also the possibility that the crew reading the sonar returns aboard the Soryu was unfamiliar with shallow-water acoustic propagation paths. Based on where the mishap occurred, the submarine was likely on the continental shelf, where propagation paths are very different compared to in deep water. As our source explains, “raw data between shallow and deep water can look identical, but mean very different things. i.e., they might have been accustomed to bottom-bounce acoustic signals but were in fact receiving direct path, if they had any signal at all. A direct path contact can be mistaken for a bottom bounce contact at 20 miles away… even to an experienced driver.” In this scenario, it’s suggested that a sonar return from the cargo ship was simply mistaken for a return from the seabed. The ex-U.S. Navy submariner does note, however, that the crews of diesel-electric submarines like the Soryu are typically more adept at shallow water operations than their nuclear-powered counterparts. Lastly, the incident could have involved a simple collision on the surface of the water, despite it being in broad daylight. After all, “dumber things have happened.” JAPAN COAST GUARD Aaron Amick had a bit of a different theory on what may have occurred, telling The War Zone: Japan’s Soryu SSK collision with the Ocean Artemis reminds us how dangerous submarines are to operate at sea. Judging by the photo taken by helicopter after the February 8th collision, it’s clear the strike occurred on the starboard side of the submarine, damaging the sail, dive surfaces, masts, and antennas. The lack of damage topside forward and aft of the sail suggest a broadside impact. If this is the case, the cargo ship was not in the submarine’s baffles and should have been visible on the sonar displays before the crash. The damage appears to be limited to the top part of the sail and the fairwater plane, indicating the submarine was in a submerged condition at the time of impact. It is clear the Soryu was making preparations for periscope depth and was sucked up into the passing hull of the Ocean Artemis or was at periscope depth and was pushed aside by the mammoth ship. Amick, who also runs Subbrief , made the following video explaining the rationale behind his thinking: Two very insightful possible explanations from two experienced submariners. Whatever turns out to be the cause of the incident, in this case, we can be thankful that no one was more badly hurt. The former U.S. Navy officer we spoke to also provided a note of caution: as behemoth cargo ships continue to proliferate in the world oceans, unfortunately, the likelihood of these sorts of collisions is only going to increase.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 24, 2021",Russia Bolsters Its Arctic Defenses With MiG-31 Interceptor Rotation In The Far North,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently released photos and video show MiG-31BM Foxhound interceptors in action at Rogachevo Air Base in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, above the Arctic Circle, an increasingly strategic region that’s home to a resurgent Russian military presence . Russia’s Ministry of Defense provided the imagery as a new rotation of MiG-31BMs arrived at the base, undertaking what the defense ministry describes as “experimental combat duty to protect the state border of the Russian Federation in the Arctic airspace.” The incoming jets and aircrew were led by the commander of the Air Force and Air Defense Army of the Northern Fleet, Lieutenant General Alexander Otroshchenko, who personally flew one of the MiG-31BMs. Otroshchenko’s contingent replaced one from the same unit that had deployed to the remote base on the southern island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in January, reportedly the first time the supersonic interceptors had ever been deployed there. Russian Ministry of Defense Novaya Zemlya lies in the Arctic Ocean, with the Barents Sea to the west and the Kara Sea to the east. It was here, during the Cold War, that the Soviet Union tested most of its nuclear weapons . While Rogachevo was an active airbase during the Cold War, in subsequent years it fell out of use and it was only in 2012 that Moscow announced that it would once again host a regular fighter presence in the future. The Russian Ministry of Defense first announced the start of this new rotational “combat duty,” Russia’s term for deployments where jets sit on quick reaction alert (QRA), on January 16, 2021. The description of these deployments as “experimental” appears to come from the fact Russian officials are still very much proving out the plan, including determining exactly what is necessary to ensure the MiG-31BMs and their crews can operate effectively at the remote base and in its frigid Arctic conditions. “The machine [the MiG-31BM] works excellently [and] there is no difference from the altitudes where we normally fly around Monchegorsk,” Lieutenant General Otroshchenko said in an interview with TV Zvezda , the official television station of the Russian Ministry of Defense. “A month has passed and we, therefore, needed to shift the aircraft and their personnel, and also have a closer look at the conditions for the servicemen and their living conditions.” “They can fly in temperatures down to minus 60°C [-76 degrees Fahrenheit], which has been confirmed in experimental operations in the area of the Northern Sea Route,” a MiG-31BM navigator named Aleksandr Kharitonov, who is part of the current rotation at Rogachevo, also told TV Zvezda . “The main nuance here is the weather, which is very complicated,” he admits. “Now, for example, the wind has for a week blown with a speed of about 100 km/h [~62 miles/hour].” The MiG-31BM aircraft — which are upgraded versions of the Cold War-era MiG-31 Foxhound — are from the Northern Fleet’s 98th Composite Aviation Regiment, home-based at Monchegorsk, located on the Kola peninsula, south of Murmansk. Until recently, the regiment had only a single squadron of MiG-31s but added a second in 2019. MiG-31BMs also made a previous series of training deployments to Rogachevo last year, after its runway was extended to 9,843 feet. The general location of the base at Rogachevo, as well as Monchegorsk to the southwest of it., Google Maps Rogachevo Air Base as seen in 2020., Google Earth “Carrying out combat duty on the [Novaya Zemlya] archipelago will significantly increase the reach of Northern Fleet fighter aircraft in the Arctic and significantly expand control of the airspace over the waters of the Northern Sea Route,” the Northern Fleet announced last month when the deployment began. The “ Northern Sea Route ” is Russia’s national transport artery in the Arctic, where the control of natural resources and maritime routes is becoming an ever more important strategic issue as Arctic ice recedes due to global climate change. Even though the MiG-31 was designed to defend the vast northern expanses of the then Soviet Union, operating from a forward deployment base in the Far North presents challenges to aircraft and personnel alike. In particular, the Defense Ministry highlighted the “low air temperatures, strong crosswinds, fog and low clouds, heavy snowfalls and other vagaries of nature” that are a feature of life in Novaya Zemlya. Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense If Russia can work out any practical issues around sending regular contingents of MiG-31BMs to Rogachevo, the aircraft, with their high-altitude and long-range capabilities, could become an important part of a larger regional anti-access and area denial strategy. If the MiG-31BMs can handle the harsh Arctic elements, then it could help pave the way for other MiG-31 variants, including the Russian Air Force’s MiG-31Ks, which are configured to carry the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, to head to various bases in the region. During the first month of the MiG-31BMs being stationed at Rogachevo there were no airspace violations “in dangerous proximity to the Russian air border in the Arctic,” the Defense Ministry noted. It’s not only manned interceptors that are helping bolster Russia’s Arctic frontiers, either. For several years, Rogachevo has also been home to an anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Northern Fleet, equipped with S-400 Triumf air defense systems , which replaced previous-generation S-300s . The addition of MiG-31s increases the defensive umbrella further still and offers greater versatility. The Foxhounds are capable of aerial refueling, although there is no evidence that tankers have also been deployed to Rogachevo. The expanded Russian military presence at Rogachevo has not gone unnoticed by the United States. In March 2019 , a U.S. Air Force B-52H bomber deployed to RAF Fairford in England flew up around the top of Svalbard in Norway, and the Franz Josef Land archipelago, before heading south to skirt the coast of Novaya Zemlya. Similar “aerial presence” flights into the Arctic region have involved a B-2 operating from Keflavik in Iceland. The next deployment will station U.S. bombers even closer to Russia when B-1Bs arrive at Ørland in Norway . Perhaps in response to that upcoming deployment, Russian Aerospace Forces Tu-160 Blackjack strategic bombers made their own long-range flight on February 9, which lasted 12 hours and took them over the Barents, Greenland, and Norwegian seas. Meanwhile, Rogachevo is just one of a number of remote bases that the Russian military can call upon in the Arctic region, on islands, as well as on the mainland. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 19 airfields have been repaired or reconstructed in the Arctic in recent years. Meanwhile, Izvestia claims that the “Arctic squadron” of the 98th Composite Aviation Regiment will be rotated to other airfields across the region as required. The regiment’s other squadron will remain on the Kola peninsula, where its main task is to defend the installations and vessels of the Northern Fleet, including ballistic missile submarines . Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Other airbases well-positioned to protect the Northern Sea Route can be found on the island of Alexandra Land on the Franz Josef Land archipelago, and on Kotelny Island on the New Siberian Islands, both of which are reportedly in the process of receiving refurbished runways suitable for use all-year-round. So far, however, only transport aircraft have been operating from these locations. Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense As well as defensive assets and transports , since 2017, long-range bombers have also been deployed to the region, operating from Vorkuta and Anadyr — both of which are on the mainland — during regular exercises. You can read more about those missions in this previous War Zone story . All this is a reflection of the far greater importance assigned to the Northern Fleet in recent years. So critical is the Arctic region to Moscow that the Northern Fleet was given the status of a military district within the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command that was established in 2014. Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense Russian Ministry of Defense As the continental ice-sheet continues to retreat, new deposits of energy resources are opening up, together with northern sea lanes that are now accessible throughout the year. With the rights to the continental shelf under the Arctic the subject of dispute between several nations, Russia’s strategic pivot to the region ensures it has a greater stake in this strategic game. Clearly, the MiG-31 is well on the way to becoming a more established resident in the Far North and we may well expect to see these — and other fighters — deployed to additional forward deployment bases in the region in the future.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jul 6, 2020",Two U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers Just Teamed Up In The South China Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz , which had its deployment extended last month, returning to the Middle East in light of continued tensions with Iran , is now in the South China Sea, where it sailed alongside its sister ship, USS Theodore Roosevelt , today. The two carriers and their respective strike groups operating together send a powerful signal to China, which has been increasingly flexing its military muscles in this hotly disputed region in recent weeks. The Navy said that the two carriers worked together in “a highly trafficked area to demonstrate the U.S. Navy’s ability to operate in challenging environments” and conducted exercises aimed at increasing interoperability, as well as command and control capabilities. Theodore Roosevelt is part of Carrier Strike Group 9 (CSG-9), which also includes, in part, Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11), the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Bunker Hill , and the Arleigh Burke class destroyers USS Russell and USS John Finn . Nimitz ’s CSG-11 consists of CVW-17, as well as the Ticonderoga class USS Princeton and the Arleigh Burke class USS Sterett . Aircraft assigned to CVW-17 fly over the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea, February 9., U.S. Navy/Seaman Deirdre Marsac “Training with Carrier Strike Group Eleven in the South China Sea is a tremendously valuable opportunity,” said Navy Rear Admiral Doug Verissimo, commander of CSG-9. “Through operations like this, we ensure that we are tactically proficient to meet the challenge of maintaining peace and we are able to continue to show our partners and allies in the region that we are committed to promoting a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” “We are committed to ensuring the lawful use of the sea that all nations enjoy under international law,” added Navy Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, the commander of CSG-11. The latest dual-carrier maneuvers continue high-profile U.S. Navy operations in the South China Sea, which are, in part, intended as a counter to growing Chinese assertiveness in the region. Using the “ nine-dash line ,” Beijing claims almost 90 percent of the disputed waters, which are crisscrossed by vital maritime trade routes, despite ongoing disputes with countries including Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In recent years, China has expanded its efforts to reclaimed and militarize a number of islands in these waters, providing bases that could be used to restrict maritime and aerial traffic if Beijing so desired. An F/A-18E Super Hornet launches from the flight deck of USS Theodore Roosevelt while conducting dual-carrier operations with the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea, February 9., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Zachary Wheeler These same two CSGs had previously conducted dual-carrier operations in June of last year, in the Philippine Sea. The last time that dual-carrier operations took place in the South China Sea was in July 2020 , when the Ronald Reagan and Nimitz CSGs twice operated together in these waters. Open-source maritime tracking data suggested that the dual-carrier operations came to an end earlier today when the cruiser USS Princeton of CSG 11 departed the South China Sea, likely accompanied by USS Nimitz . The latest exercise comes amid another spike in Chinese military aviation activity around the northern end of the South China Sea. Last January 31, the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense reported that eight Chinese aircraft, including fighter jets , maritime patrol, and surveillance types, had flown into the southwestern corner of its Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ, in the previous two days. This uptick in activity has also included reported mock attack runs made by Chinese aircraft on the USS Theodore Roosevelt . According to the British newspaper the Financial Times , individuals familiar with this incident had heard radio chatter of the Chinese pilots going through the procedures involved in releasing anti-ship cruise missiles. For its part, the USS Nimitz departed its homeport of Bremerton, Washington, as long ago as April 2020. The Nimitz is now finally heading back to Bremerton, after around 10 months at sea — longer than is typically required. Since last summer, the Nimitz CSG has mainly been operating just outside the Persian Gulf but also ventured further afield for the Malabar exercise with the Indian Navy in November, as well as contributing to Operation Octave Quartz in December, during which around 700 U.S. troops were moved out of Somalia to other locations in Africa. You can read more about the operation in this previous War Zone story. The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group transits in formation with the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in the South China Sea, February 9., U.S. Navy/Seaman Deirdre Marsac Considering how long this carrier has now been at sea, it makes sense that the exercise with its fellow Nimitz class carrier in the South China Sea would be of relatively short duration. More generally, the Navy is grappling with the strain being put on its carrier fleets amid a surge in demand for them to support U.S. military operations around the world, but at a time when a significant number of the flattops are tied up undergoing maintenance and major overhauls. The USS Theodore Roosevelt had already completed one operational cruise in 2020 before leaving its home base of San Diego, California, in December to begin its latest scheduled deployment to the Indo-Pacific region. You can find out more about these so-called “double pump” deployments in this previous article. Elsewhere, the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) — which includes the Wasp class landing helicopter dock USS Makin Island (LHD-8) and the landing platform docks USS San Diego and USS Somerset — swapped places with the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in the North Arabian Sea last week. The amphibious warships arrived on station in the Middle East after having operated off the Horn of Africa. As of February 9, the Makin Island ARG had transited the Strait of Hormuz and is now in the Persian Gulf. The guided-missile destroyers USS John Finn left, and USS Russell , move into formation alongside the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt ., U.S. Navy/Seaman Deirdre Marsac When USS Nimitz left the Middle East, leaving that region without an aircraft carrier, the Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby explained that the number of big-deck carriers available to the United States at any given time made it a case of balancing requirements from various parts of the world. “Every decision that we make with military forces — air, ground or naval — and certainly, decisions that you make with respect to a capital asset, like an aircraft carrier and its associated, supporting Strike Group is a decision driven by a frank assessment of the threats in the area, and also a frank consideration of the capabilities themselves,” Kirby said. The Middle East may not be left without a big-deck carrier for long, however, with rumors that the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower could be on its way there, or is at least heading to the wider region. Meanwhile, in the Indo-Pacific region, other countries, too, continue to assert their rights to freedom of movement in the South China Sea, including France, which recently sent the Rubis class nuclear-powered attack submarine Émeraude through the waters. This spring, the British aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will also venture into the Pacific theater, with plans for the Royal Navy’s flagship to take part in joint exercises with Japanese maritime forces, as part of the Carrier Strike Group 21 deployment. “Japan and the U.K. have forged a close defense and security partnership that is being elevated to new heights this year when the U.K. Carrier Strike Group visits the Indo-Pacific,” U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said. The British carrier is widely expected to take part in navigation patrols in the disputed South China Sea, too. Clearly, the South China Sea is a particular flashpoint, but tensions between Washington and Beijing have also recently flared up over issues including Taiwan , trade, espionage , and the COVID-19 pandemic. Only weeks into his presidency, President Joe Biden has already stated that China presents the “most critical challenge” to the United States. The USS Nimitz leads a formation of ships from the Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group during dual-carrier operations., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Markus Castaneda While the United States flying the flag in the South China Sea and signaling to its allies was a critical foreign policy tool under the previous Trump Administration, the latest dual-carrier maneuvers suggest that these activities are likely to continue, for now at least, under President Biden.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 29, 2021",Marine Corps Reveals It Has Tested A New Anti-Ship Missile Launcher Truck,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has confirmed that it test-fired a Naval Strike Missile anti-ship cruise missile from a new launcher based on the 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle truck last year. Mobile ground-based launchers loaded with anti-ship and other longer-range missiles are key components of the service’s current plans for conducting distributed operations in the future. The Marine Corps told Naval News that the test had taken place in November 2020. The most recent annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, said that the plan had been to conduct the first launch of a Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from this new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) based system in June of that year, but that this had been pushed back after the discovery of a software issue. However, that report only covered test and evaluation activities through September 2020, so it was initially unclear if the Marines had kept to their new schedule. Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV). The service says it has tested a launcher for the Naval Strike Missile based on this vehicle., USMC The test “was successful in validating certain technologies and capabilities,” a Marine Corps spokesperson said in a statement to Naval News . “The Marine Corps is investing in technologies to ensure we maintain our competitive edge. Ground Based Anti-ship Missile redefines the battlespace for our adversaries and ensures that we maintain our competitive edge.” The Marine Corps did not give any further details about the test or the launcher, or release any relevant pictures or concept art. However, the Marine Corps is understood to be exploring a launch system using an unmanned JLTV derivative as part of a program called Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary-Fires ( ROGUE-Fires ). Concept art of that vehicle shows a JLTV chassis with a launcher based on the one used in the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). HIMARS is mounted on a 6×6 Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) truck chassis. The HIMARS launcher is currently able to fire 227mm guided artillery rockets , pre-loaded in six-round pods, as well as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) quasi-ballistic missile, only one of which can be made ready to fire at a time. The system would have sufficient space to accommodate pods loaded with multiple NSMs and it has been suggested as a potential ground-based launcher option for those missiles in the past. A page discussing a version of the HIMARS launcher capable of firing the NSM, among other missiles, from a 2016 Marine Corps “toolkit” that describes various notional future capabilities that could be included in simulated wargames., USMC At the annual Modern Day Marine Expo in 2019, JLTV-manufacturer Oshkosh had also unveiled a version of that vehicle with a six-round launcher for the UVision Hero-120 , a loitering munition, also commonly known as a “suicide drone.” Since retiring their M327 120mm mortars in 2018, the Marines have been exploring loitering munitions as one possible option to help fill the resulting capability gap. You can read more about that effort and UVision’s Hero series of suicide drones, in this past War Zone piece . The Hero-120 is substantially shorter than the NSM. However, the launcher still offers a view of what a manned JLTV-based launcher for that missile might look like, at least to some degree. The Oshkosh concept for a six-round JLTV-based launcher for the Hero-120 loitering munition., Oshkosh Norwegian defense contractor Kongsberg, which developed the NSM, has long offered its own ground-based launcher option that can hold up to four containerized rounds at a time. However, these have more commonly been seen on larger trucks, such as the Army’s 10-wheeled Palletized Load System (PLS) truck . Regardless of the exact configuration of the launch platform, a ground-based NSM launch is a core component of the Marine Corps’ current future warfighting concepts. Last year, the service unveiled a plan to dramatically reshape its entire force structure , cutting back on various traditional capabilities, including eliminating all of its M1 Abrams tanks , in favor of new capabilities, including longer-range ground-based anti-ship and land-attack missiles. The NSM, which you read more about in these past War Zone pieces , has a secondary land-attack capability already, which makes it a highly flexible and versatile weapon. The Marines, with a particular eye toward a major potential future island-hopping conflict in the Pacific region, want units to be able to rapidly set up forward bases with ground-based missile batteries, among other capabilities, to challenge enemy ground and naval units. The idea is for those same units to have the ability to relocate just as quickly to make it more difficult for opponents to react and to reduce the vulnerability of friendly forces to counterattacks. You can read more about this concept, known as Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO), in this previous War Zone story . A US Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft unloads Marine JLTVs on a beach during an exercise., USN The Corps is now looking to craft at least new Marine Littoral Regiments , which will be organized around the EABO concept, in and around the Pacific by 2030. The service is also looking at how these units could contribute to potential conflicts in and around Europe and the Middle East, as well. “Its [the Marine Littoral Regiment] focus is on those capabilities that enable the naval force by contributing to sea denial in support of fleet operations,” Marine Corps Brigadier General Benjamin Watson, the head of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, said during a virtual event hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association last week. “So it’s a unit that’s designed to be lethal first and foremost, on land or at sea and from the land to the sea, to operate in distributed small units that are low signature and to bring capabilities that enable the larger naval or joint force, particularly in contested or a denied degraded environment.” Ground-based NSMs are an essential part of future Marine units’ ability to help support sea denial missions. Having mobile, readily deployable launchers to fire those missiles are another key part of that equation. With the test last year, the Marines have taken an important step toward turning the concept into reality.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Oct 15, 2020",Check Out The Damage To This Japanese Submarine After It Collided With A Cargo Ship (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A collision between a Japanese submarine and a cargo ship in the Pacific Ocean has resulted in injuries to at least three submariners, according to initial reports. The incident occurred today at 10:58 AM local time, around 25 miles southeast of Cape Ashizuri, in the waters off the island of Shikoku, which lies southwest of Japanâ€™s main island of Honshu. The submarine involved was the first-in-class Soryu , one of 11 of these diesel-electric attack submarines active with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). The submarine entered service in 2009 and was taking part in a routine training exercise at the time of the collision. The first-in-class diesel-electric attack submarine Soryu ., Japanese Ministry of Defense The Soryu , which has a surfaced displacement of approximately 2,900 tons and a length of just over 275 feet, scraped the hull of the commercial vessel as it was surfacing , according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Unconfirmed reports suggest the cargo ship was the bulk carrier Ocean Artemis , which departed the Chinese city of Qingdao on Friday and was headed for Okayama Prefecture in western Japan. With 51,000 gross tons and a length of 750 feet, the Ocean Artemis is registered in Hong Kong and was transporting iron ore.Â Japanese government officials stated that three crew members on the submarine suffered minor injuries that did not require hospital treatment. Supposedly, damage to the Soryu was limited to a mast housing a periscope and a communication antenna and the submarine was able to continue. However, it is not known if it headed back to its homeport at Kure in Hiroshima Prefecture. The damage to the antenna mast seems to have resulted in a total loss of communications and the submarine was required to navigate to a location where the crew could contact their base headquarters using mobile phones. This resulted in a delay of three and a half hours before the crew of the Soryu could report the accident.Â A series of images provided by the Japan Coast Guard â€” including the photo at the top of this feature â€” that show the Soryu after the incident reveal additional and more serious damage to the submarine, especially to its sail and dive planes. The photos were taken from one of the Coast Guardâ€™s Saab 340B maritime patrol aircraft. 5th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters 5th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters 5th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told members of the press that the commercial vessel had reported to the Japan Coast Guard that no impact was felt, and it does not appear to have sustained any damage. So far, there have been no reports of injuries to any of the crew of the commercial vessel. OCEAN ARTEMIS pic.twitter.com/FwhVHfb0W6 — ã‚‹ã­ã•ã¾æç£ğŸ°ğŸ’œï¼ˆã¸ãã‚‹ï¼‰ (@hekiru417P) February 8, 2021 Immediately after the accident, the Japanese government set up a response unit to investigate how the collision happened, as well as to assess the safety of the commercial vessel and provide rescue services if required. In a statement , Japanâ€™s Minister of Defense Nobuo Kishi said the collision was â€œregrettable.â€ The incident demonstrates the risk of collision between submarines and surface vessels, especially when the former are surfacing. Collisions with surface vessels , as well as underwater obstructions, or even the seabed, are an ever-present hazard.Â For a submarineâ€™s crew to be provided with collision-warning, its active sonar has to be operating. While this can be activated to see if there any obstacles in the submarineâ€™s path, in many operational scenarios the active sonar is not an option since it emits signals that other submarines and ships can detect. â€œThere are conditions when you can have a quick transmit to see if thereâ€™s anything in the way, but operational scenarios more often than not will not support that,â€ former British Royal Navy submarine commander Jeff Tall explained to the Guardian in 2003. â€œIf you transmit on your own signal â€” if you go ping â€” some other bastard is going to hear it.â€ On the other hand, the submarineâ€™s passive sonar avoids the risk of detection and could have been used in this scenario. While a passive sonar may provide less information than its active counterpart, a vessel the size of this cargo ship that is underway should have been detected. If the commercial vessel was not running, it may have been harder to detect and/or find a range for.Â JMSDF submarine Soryu is pulled away from a submarine tender off Guam., U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 3RD CLASS RANDALL W. RAMASWAMY While running submerged, a submarine can also call upon its inertial navigation system, which should provide an accurate position, based on 3D gyroscopes, but which is only useful for non-moving obstacles. Furthermore, the inertial navigation system needs frequent calibration to ensure its accuracy. Navigating underwater is also heavily dependent on having very accurate maps of the seabed, which in turn requires various types of underwater survey equipment .Â The process of surfacing is recognized as one of the riskiest that a submarine has to do. Before completing such a maneuver, the crew will first plot any objects that can be detected on the surface â€” such as commercial vessels, or indeed warships. However, some surface obstacles are notoriously tricky to identify using sonar, in particular icebergs . The periscope can also be used just prior to surfacing, scanning the surface of the water for shadows of potential hazards.Â The Soryu maneuvers at speed while surfaced., Japanese Ministry of Defense Professor Ito Toshiyuki, a retired JMSDF vice admiral, told the Japan Broadcasting Corporation that the accident should not have occurred. He noted that the dangers of the surfacing procedure would have been known to the crew and that they should have confirmed that the maneuver was safe using the sonar systems. It suggested that the sonar system may not have been properly functioning, or otherwise, there could have been â€œproblems with the crewâ€™s skills or their teamwork.â€ While we donâ€™t yet know the cause of this accident, it is possible that only luck prevented a much worse outcome. In February 2001, for example, a Japanese fishery training ship, the Ehime Maru , was struck by the Los Angeles class nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Greeneville , when it surfaced south of Oahu, Hawaii. On that occasion , the commercial vessel was sunk with the loss of nine of the 35 people on board. Update, 7:30 am PST: Since we posted this story yesterday, a number of new photos have become available, revealing in quite a lot more detail the damage sustained to the submarine. In particular, itâ€™s now clear that the starboard-side dive plane received a significant hit, and can be seen almost broken in two around the midway point. In more than one photo, crewmembers can be seen securing the broken dive plane with cables.

The first of these, a former submariner who saw active service during the Cold War, provided the following observation: â€œI can attest to the risky nature of either going to periscope depth (PD) or surfacing. I would be confident that the Japanese sub crew was following all the normal protocols for either op but still managed to not detect the freighter. We nearly had it happen to us â€” with all the latest sonar assets and following protocol to the letter. All failed to detect the Russian freighter 500 yards off our port side. Yes, close enough to pick out the flag while executing a crash dive. Best we could figure after the laundry moment was there was a really hard salinity layer above us that was deflecting all the noise from the Russian. â€ A retired U.S. Navy commander suggested that the Japanese submarine Â could have been in the process of a training routine, during which it was looking at the underside of the ship. In this way, the submarine could have either simply got too close to the cargo ship to avoid a collision or otherwise got sucked toward it by the hydrodynamic forces imparted. The same source added: â€œI am inclined to think that the professionalism in the submarine world â€” among ourselves and our immediate friends â€” is such a high standard that this mishap under the sea was a snoop gone wrong.â€ We will continue to update this story as and when more confirmed details of the incident emerge.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",Boeing’s Chief F-15 Test Pilot Talks Flying The Air Force’s New Eagle On Its Maiden Flight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “We were confident that in the first 15 minutes of this flight we were going to be up to Mach 2, and that’s exactly what we did,” said Boeing’s F-15 Chief Test Pilot Matt “Phat” Giese who was at the controls for the maiden flight of the first new F-15EX for the U.S. Air Force on February 2, 2021. Giese and fellow test pilot Mike “Houdini” Quintini flew F-15EX-1, as it is known internally, from the Boeing facility at Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, Missouri, for 90 minutes, as part of an effort to ensure the aircraft is ready to be delivered in the first quarter of this year. The War Zo ne was first to disclose the existence of the F-15EX initiative and evaluate its merits just two and a half years ago. “This was not a traditional first flight in the sense of a brand new clean-sheet design,” Giese told The War Zone in an interview organized by Boeing after the flight. “It speaks to the maturity of this platform already.” The rationale behind the USAF procuring the two-seat F-15EX is that it is a readily available solution to efficiently recapitalize the aging F-15C/D Eagle fleet. It builds on the baseline F-15QA that is currently in production for Qatar . “We inserted the USAF [Suite 9] Operational Flight Program into the jet, so it was minimal impact on what we would normally do on a first flight. Since we have some maturity already from that platform, the first flight profile [mirrored] very closely what we would do on a normal production acceptance test flight of any jet off the line at St. Louis.” The first F-15EX first flight. , Boeing video Screencaps The first flight of the F-15EX signaled a remarkable milestone in the story of the Eagle, coming nearly 48 years after test pilot Irv Burrows completed the maiden flight of the very first McDonnell Douglas YF-15A on July 27, 1972, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Just six months later, the USAF approved the Eagle for full-rate production. “I was getting ready to step to the airplane [when] I got a text message that Irv Burrows was watching the live stream — and I got a chill up my spine,” says Giese. “I recognized the significance of what we did on February 2, which is [to] deliver this brand new platform that has a wonderful almost 49-year legacy now. To have him as a part of that celebration — the first pilot of the F-15 to the newest pilots on the F-15 — it was a momentous event. I had to regroup, refocus, and get back in the game, and of course, we were able to do that nicely.” Giese says that he and Quintini had to delay the takeoff by around 20 minutes to allow some weather to clear, but then the flight went off without a hitch, describing being at the controls for the first F-15EX mission as “a privilege and an honor.” He adds: “The jet performed as we expected. As a test pilot, this is one of the best things we can do, a first flight, and once you do it no one can take that away from you.” Matt “Phat” Giese gets pumped at the controls of the first F-15EX as he taxis out for departure., Boeing video screencap “We flew [profile wise] our normal Acceptance Test Procedure [ATP] with just a few caveats in the sense that this jet has some instrumentation, [and] some Open Mission System [OMS] cabling, which increases capability. The profile was a ‘Viking takeoff’ right out of St. Louis — and the reason we [did] that on our first flight is that we were confident in how the jet was going to perform. If there was any question at all on how the OFP was going to affect this jet or this specific platform, we would have done a more traditional first flight, which is stay slow, probably leave the gear down for a while, do some powered approach test points and then work your way out to faster up and away approaches.” “We were so confident this jet was going to perform well we went straight to the ATP —  maximum afterburner and pulled-up on a ‘Viking’ — and I had zero problem with that profile and proved it from the start. We went out to what’s called the “Mac North” airspace and executed some flight control checks to make sure the aircraft rig was correct. We climbed up and made sure the jet fuel starter worked on the way up. We got up to 40,000 feet and pushed out to Mach 2. That [speed] is a CFT [Conformal Fuel Tank] limitation. If it was a clean jet we’d go out to Mach 2.5. We did engine checks at 40,000 feet, at 30,000 feet, and then we came down to 20,000 feet and we intentionally shut down the perfectly good engines and then re-started those motors in both primary and secondary mode to prove the reliability of the General Electric GE-129 motors . We had no problems with the re-starts.” VIKING AERO IMAGES/Alex Farwell Giese and Quintini then descended for some Visual Flight Rules (VFR) work for the remaining profiles. “We checked the load limiter, the roll limiter, the Environmental Control System, how did the landing gear perform for extension/retraction in both normal and emergency modes, and then we did a bunch of avionics checks,” Giese explained. “How’s the radar working, how’s the electronic warfare system powering-on, are the radios functioning properly, our normal acceptance test procedure — we ran through the rest of that.” Giese points out that the “target” aircraft for the mission — likely a company-owned A-4 Skyhawk — had maintenance issues and was not able to participate in the mission. “When that was done — not surprisingly — we had extra gas because that’s another big advantage of this platform, the fuel capacity with the CFTs. With that extra gas, Mike Quintini and I decided we deserved a little high alpha maneuvering for our efforts.” Giese says they demonstrated “tailslides and other advanced control and handling maneuvers just to show that this thing is a really good slow-speed fighter in addition to a high-speed fighter.” Giese said he also checked the test instrumentation was “ready to go” so that when the jet is delivered to the customer at Eglin Air Force Base it is immediately available to enter the USAF flight-test program. “When that was done we hit our bingo fuel and we had to get back to the base with a normal recovery fuel amount. At the same time, the constraint is that we need to demonstrate that the fuel low caution asserts at the appropriate value. We came back to the pattern with enough gas to be safe and return home safely, but then we had the opportunity to use that gas.” Giese flew a series of touch-and-gos and tight close circuit patterns, reefing the F-15EX into tight break turns with the afterburners engaged. Giese says he could see the design and engineering teams watching on the ground. “It was just a privilege to be able to demonstrate that to them and give them several patterns.” “Right before the full-stop [landing] the fuel low caution asserted on cue. The other thing we check on landing is the anti-skid system. You may have noticed in the video a little puff of smoke as we slowed down below 100 knots — that was me slamming on the brakes like I was getting ready to be in an accident. It kicked-in the anti-skid and allowed us to come to a stop quickly and demonstrate that system was working.” Giese said the flight threw up some “minor squawks” in terms of maintenance issues “but nothing we wouldn’t normally see on an ATP,” he adds, and nothing that would preclude handing a jet over to a customer. F-15EX-1 is now due to make a customer flight, and the first flight of the second jet is now a focus as Boeing works towards delivering the first two aircraft to the USAF at Eglin in the first quarter of this year to initially join the ongoing Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) test program . Read all about what it is like to be at the controls flying the Advanced Eagle that the F-15EX is based on in this previous War Zone exclusive . Boeing’s flight-test work with the F-15EX is initially limited to the additional test instrumentation, and any other unique wiring and cabling. “These first two airplanes have been laid out with the Open Mission Systems [OMS] high-speed fiber cabling,” explains Giese, referring to the new open avionics architecture that is planned for the F-15EX. The following six Lot 2 production aircraft will additionally feature the OMS processor. “They will have the full capability for the OMS architecture that the USAF has planned for these airplanes,” Giese explains. “We’re not going to be invited to the fight anymore if we can’t be flexible and we can’t communicate and have agility across platforms. To me, what that means is there’s two ways the F-15 is going to go. One is the immediate need — the Air Force needs [F-15EX] right now for the aging C-model fleet. You’ve got to replace these jets first. As important is the long-term strategic plan the USAF has for this platform, and it is teaming — it is manned/unmanned teaming — so what can the EX do with this OMS cabling and processor that can help all these combatant commanders with these new types of warfare that we’re entering into.” Giese says the OMS makes the F-15EX very “adaptable and flexible,” allowing for rapid changes in mission systems. “Once you open up the things that are outside the safety-of-flight box, you have the ability to rapidly change things on the fly, maybe even day-to-day in a conflict to react to some sort of threat that’s changing constantly — that’s a huge capability.” Giese says this will enable the F-15EX to react quickly to emerging or unforeseen threats. “As a pilot, I may see a change required in the cockpit for example, maybe it’s a display, maybe I’m not being presented with the information the way that I need to execute the tactical mission. I can relay that back to the engineering teams, and when it’s in an OMS box, they can rapidly change [it]. I can step to the jet maybe the next day, and have that ability to see that new tactical information that maybe I lacked in a previous sortie. So it’s an ability to adapt quicker than we have in the past and to be flexible to any sort of changing or emerging threat.” VIKING AERO IMAGES/Alex Farwell The USAF ordered an initial eight new Advanced Eagles under a $1.2-billion deal that was announced in July 2020, and it is set to procure a minimum of 144 F-15EXs under an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract worth up to $22.89 billion, with 80 of the new fighters planned over the next five years. “Everybody knows the Air Force, and particularly the Air National Guard, needs this new platform,” endorses Giese, adding that comparing early Eagle variants with the F-15EX is like “night and day from a capability perspective.” “We have the most powerful mission computer processor [in the Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II] in any fighter on the planet today, with room for growth. We have the most powerful radar [Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array] that we have ever seen in a fighter. Then you add EPAWSS, which is a brand new electronic warfare capability, which is really what the community needed. You’ve got stations 1 and 9 [allowing a total of] 12 missiles now. I’ve flown it with 12 missiles before and quite frankly I felt like King Kong in the jet. How often we will train like that I don’t know, but having that capability if we need it with a 4-ship going out with 48 missiles is unbelievable!” The Advanced Eagle cockpit layout is impressive, to say the least. , Boeing The F-15EX also has an extended airframe life out to 20,000 flight hours. “What’s even more important from a longevity perspective is how well this platform is maintained, how safe it is and how reliable it is. We have this new [digital] flight control system that’s easier to maintain — it’s highly reliable. I’ve been flying the digital F-15 since 2013 and I have ground-aborted zero times for flight control problems. We build them easier, quicker, faster, and that ends up with a more reliable platform that — when it ends up on the ramp — aircraft availability goes way up because it just doesn’t break.” “Maintainers themselves as they train to this new platform, if you go to a new MDS [Mission Design Series — aircraft type] for example, it’s months of training for these young kids to learn the new platform. This is going to take a day. They’re going to learn the new flight control computers, and which LRIs [Line Replaceable Items] to pull and they’re going to recognize they won’t have to pull them that often—it’s a very quick transition. So from the impact of the flight line itself, it will be minimal if not zero.” “I believe this is the most lethal and survivable jet that’s on the market today and I say that because the battlespace effects that this airplane can provide are on par or exceed what you can do with an LO [low observable] platform that has restrictions. This jet has 30,000 lb of things we can put on the wings and the fuselage,” adds Giese. “No one’s going to match that. Then if you marry that up with the radar and the EW system, I would argue — even as a guy that flew the F-22 for 12 years — that this platform produces battlespace effects — which is what the commanders care about — that are equal or better than what an LO platform can do, that’s based on power, size, payload, and capacity.” VIKING AERO IMAGES/Alex Farwell The fact that the USAF has not purchased any new Eagles since the last F-15E Strike Eagle was delivered in the early 2000s, and that fighter procurement has focused on low observable (stealthy) platforms such as the F-22A Raptor and F-35A Lightning II from Lockheed Martin in recent years, makes the domestic F-15EX buy particularly important to Boeing. The F-15EX is all about the simplicity of transition from the F-15C, tapping into existing pilot training and infrastructure to fast-track entry into service, and save a lot of money in the process of doing so. The first operational F-15EX unit is planned as the Air National Guard’s 142nd Fighter Wing , based in Portland, Oregon, which will receive its first jets in 2023. From contract signature to fielding, the F-15EX program is on a par with that original Eagle fielding that went from its first flight in 1972 to service entry two years later. “Mike Quintini and I recognized the significance of the event,” Giese says reflecting on the first flight on February 2. “We had to take a moment as we were stepping to the jet — we stepped aside in a room, and we looked at each other and realized how important this really was. What a significant event this really was to start selling F-15s to the USAF again after a couple of decades. From pen to paper a couple of years ago, to where we were on February 2 was a whirlwind — it happened really, really fast. But we did it safely and reliably.” “My cellphone was hot on Wednesday night — I got so many phone calls from guys who were excited about the new platform. In fact, one of the senior F-15C pilots in the community who is stationed at Eglin and who is going to be receiving these first two airplanes called me. I haven’t flown with him in a decade and he asked me a ton of questions about the aircraft and how it performed — he was giggling like a child at my answers. You’ve got these senior guys in the community right now that are just really excited about this platform.” “Doing a first flight is a highlight in a test pilot’s career — in fact, it’s kind of the pinnacle in a career to do something like this, and although I’ve done a few first flights before, this by far surpasses anything I’ve ever done in my flight-test career.” Regardless of personal firsts, the Air Force’s new advanced Eagle is now a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 15, 2020",Air Force Doubles Down On E-11A BACN Communications Jets With Plans To Triple Fleet Size,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is in talks to buy another E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node , or BACN, aircraft, the first of six that it hopes to acquire over the next five years. These highly specialized communications aircraft are in such high demand that all of the existing operational examples had historically been forward deployed in Afghanistan, where one of them crashed after suffering an engine failure just over a year ago. In recent months, however, they appear to have shifted the focus of their operations to the Persian Gulf region. The 66th Air Base Group’s Public Affairs Office disclosed that the BACN program office – both of which are situated at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts – was in the process of negotiating a contract for a new E-11A aircraft on Feb. 5, 2021. This followed the award of a $3.6 billion contract to Northrop Grumman to sustain and otherwise support these BACN aircraft, as well as the fleet of EQ-4B Global Hawk drones that also carry this communications payload. At present, the Air Force has three E-11As and four EQ-4Bs. An E-11A BACN aircraft., USAF “BACN is a critical tool that commanders know they can rely on,” Andy Manvell, the Deputy Branch Chief of the BACN program, said in a statement. “They know that they might not be able to establish communications without it. It is a very important tool and it has definitely helped save lives. Just imagine if you had someone shooting at you and there was no support. BACN helps to ensure that support arrives.” The E-11As are derived from the Bombardier BD-700 business jet. The BACN payload that they carry is an extremely robust communications gateway that can rapidly send and receive data transmitted through various waveforms to and from a wide array of aerial platforms, as well as forces on the ground. In addition to being able to “translate” between various different communications and data sharing systems, these aircraft have been vital communications relay nodes in Afghanistan, where the country’s mountainous terrain limits the reach of line-of-sight links. All three of the Air Force’s current fleet of E-11As – which have the serial numbers 11-9001, 11-9335, and 12-9506 – are assigned to the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron, which, at least as of late last year, was based at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. However, starting sometime around October 2020, online flight tracking indicated that the aircraft moved to Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and began conducting regular sorties over the Persian Gulf. The reasons for this shift is unclear. Regardless, it’s important to note that the aircraft do make trips back to the United States from time to time for more intensive maintenance and other work. Two of the aircraft, with the serial numbers 11-9001 and 12-9506, appear to have swapped places just recently, with the former jet returning to the United States, while the latter headed to Al Dhafra. The E-11As are the textbook definition of a very high-value, but extremely low-density asset. In 2016 alone, the Air Force said that this small fleet of aircraft support 7,000 airstrikes in Afghanistan, and the type flew its 10,000th sortie the following year. You can read more about these aircraft, as well as the BACN program, and how these aircraft are employed as a whole, in this past War Zone feature . There are so few BACN aircraft that their crews are made up of volunteers from across the Air Force who may not have ever seen one of the jets before they climb into the cockpit of one at a deployed location. The standard procedure is for pilots headed for the 430th Expeditionary Electronic Combat Squadron to receive a month of simulator training , before heading downrange for “in-theater indoctrination training.” When one of the E-11As, with the serial number 11-9358, crashed in Afghanistan on Jan. 27, 2020, it was actually on an operational sortie that was also serving as a qualification flight for the copilot. Both the aircraft’s pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Voss, and the copilot, Captain Ryan Phaneuf, were tragically killed in the incident. A subsequent investigation determined that the plane’s left engine had failed after a turbine blade broke off inside. This was then compounded by the crew’s decision to shut down the right engine, as well. Failed attempts to restart the right engine, along with a decision to attempt to return to Kandahar rather than divert to a closer airstrip, appear to have sealed the aircraft’s fate. It’s unclear why the crew shut down the right engine, though the Air Force’s report speculated they may have been concerned it had suffered damage, too. Why that engine would not then restart is also not exactly clear, but this might have been linked to a total loss of electric power on board. There were indications from the wreckage that the crew had attempted to use the aircraft’s Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to get the right engine going again. Investigators were hampered in their own work due to the fact that the digital flight data recorder had stopped working after the aircraft’s primary electric generators cut out from loss of power from the engines. Whatever the exact circumstances of the accident, The loss of 11-9358, representing 25 percent of the E-11A fleet, was certainly significant and it’s not surprising that the Air Force is looking to buy a replacement, as well as additional examples. It’s not clear whether the six planned additional E-11As that the Air Force wants to buy will be operated on top of the existing trio, which have now all been flying in this role for around a decade, or will in part replace those jets. While the possibility seems remote, even if the Air Force ultimately replaced the three E-11As it has now, fielding six aircraft by 2026 would still double the size of the fleet. Having more BACN-equipped aircraft in total can only help reduce the strain on the individual planes and make it easier to rotate them out for more intensive maintenance and upgrades, as well as potentially deploy them to other regions, as desired. The extra aircraft would provide additional capacity to actually train and do development work stateside, as well. In addition, the Air Force is also planning on retiring its entire fleet of EQ-4Bs , meaning the additional E-11As could be called upon to help fill the gap left by the retirement of those drones in the near term. The service’s eventual goal is to replace those unmanned platforms with an entirely new communications gateway under development under the gatewayONE portion of its Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program. You can read more about gatewayONE and the platforms that might carry it in this past War Zone piece . No matter what, as it stands now, it seems likely that the bulk of the E-11A fleet will continue to operate primarily over the Middle East or Afghanistan. President Donald Trump’s Administration had overseen a significant drawdown of American forces in that country and was actively pursuing a peace deal with the Taliban, which held the promise of paving the way for all U.S. forces to leave after nearly two decades of conflict . This might help explain the movement of the existing jets to Al Dhafra last year. However, President Joe Biden’s new administration has said the Afghan militant group has not met its initial obligations under an initial agreement signed last year and negotiations now seem to be, at best, stalled . The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a Congressional watchdog, said in its most recent quarterly report, covering October to December 2020, that U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan had actually increased compared to the previous quarter, despite the focus shifting entirely to defensive sorties to protect Afghan government forces . As it stands now, the Air Force hopes to formally sign the contract to buy its next E-11A in March, with the goal of having that aircraft delivered in June. Depending on how long it takes to get the plane fully configured for the BACN mission, it could be headed straight to Afghanistan soon afterward.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some come for the plays. Some come for the halftime show. Some come for the commercials. And yes, some are mainly in it for the opening flyover . This year, aviation nerds got a unique offering for the Super Bowl —Air Force Global Strike Command provided one each of their bombers—a B-52 , a B-1 , and a B-2 . It would be the first bomber trio flyover for a big game. Although it wasn’t heavily promoted, the aircraft’s designations also add up to 55 (B-1 + B-2 + B-52=55), which was ideal for Super Bowl LV, or 55. The three bombers, with the B-2 in the lead, hit their mark exactly as Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan reached the National Anthem’s crescendo, with the jets roaring by overhead, silhouetted against the Tampa Bay twilight. While the footage of the flyover was a little abrupt during the broadcast, one aviation photographer— our friend Mike Killian —captured the moment impeccably. Mike set up across from the stadium in order to get the highly dissimilar formation of aircraft flying together in the same frame, all set against the evening sky. His work paid off, as he got some of the only striking images of the flyby under what were extremely challenging lighting conditions. This shouldn’t be surprising as Killian is known for shooting high-stakes subjects , including a huge number of rocket launches. Mike Killian Photography Mike Killian Photography Mike Killian Photography Mike Killian Photography Mike Killian Photography Mike also shot a static wide-angle video of the flyover from his perspective. You can hear his shutter snapping away in the background: Here are some other perspectives of the big moment, as well: The bombers came from Missouri, South Dakota, and North Dakota for the flyover, joining up over the Gulf of Mexico off Tampa to hold before pushing on towards their ‘target’ under the callsigns DRAGO 51, 52, and 53. Tanker support for the flyover and the combat air patrol (CAP) of fighters that were also up in the area made for some busy military action over and around Tampa. The bomber trio formation was so interesting not just because it represented the Air Force’s bomber inventory, but also because the airframes are so radically different from one another. The B-1B is a swing-wing, sleek design with powerful F101 turbofan engines that are capable of afterburning. The B-52 is the classic—a huge-winged, lumbering, eight-engined Cold War beast of an aircraft. Then you have the B-2, a pure flying wing and stealthy design. It is one eclectic threesome whose silhouettes underscore just how different they are. While they have been shot together over the years from time to time, they have never done so under such high-profile circumstances. As always, news of the flyover rehashed the old debate about how much these kinds of endeavors cost. You can’t blame those who aren’t familiar with military aircraft operations to wonder about it. I addressed that on Twitter prior to the flyover: So there you have it, Super Bowl 55’s flyover is in the history books.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the biggest show in American sports is about to get underway in Tampa, Florida as the Buccaneers face off against the Chiefs, another Super Bowl of sorts has been ongoing in Southern Nevada, this one being of the air combat kind. The latest iteration of the Air Force’s Red Flag aerial wargames have been underway, with the blue forces taking on the red forces over the expansive Nevada Test and Training Range . Most of these players launch out of Nellis Air Force Base in North Las Vegas, including the most alien-looking of them all, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber . While we have repeatedly showcased just how otherworldly the Spirit can look from various angles, aviation photographer Scott Krammer has offered us new evidence of this reality with images snapped as one of the B-2s climbed out from Nellis on a Red Flag sortie last week. The image, seen at the top of this post, provides an angle on the B-2’s underside that looks like science fiction, giving us an incredibly intimate view of all the different taped seams, serrated doors, flush-mounted air sensors, and access points that make up the stealth bomber’s seemingly smooth underbelly. The photo also underscores just how much work goes into keeping the B-2s in their lowest-observable state and how complex of a flying machine they truly are. Krammer also provided The War Zone with another stunning angle of the Spirit, a frontal view as one takes off from Nellis and turns towards the ranges.

U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane activity is not all that rare over California, but one test flight that emanated from the Air Force’s sprawling Plant 42 installation in Palmdale, California on February 4 certainly drew some attention. Airplane trackers kept tabs on the flight via online aircraft tracking software, while others spotted the U-2 up above 60,000-feet from terra-firma below. The test mission flew all over the state, before returning to base at Plant 42, where our contributor Matt Hartman just happened to be spotting. The result was some awesome detailed images of the U-2 that flew the sortie, which included a rare look at the Dragon Lady equipped with a modern panoramic imaging sensor installed in its glazed under-fuselage ‘Q bay,’ which seemed to still be actively scanning the ground below as the high-flying jet came into land. U-2s have soldiered on way farther than pretty much anyone would have thought by now, but the type just keeps getting better with age . The RQ-4 Global Hawk was supposed to replace it, but as it sits now, the U-2 may be in just as good if not a better position to serve on into the future as the Global Hawk. Some of the U-2 testing that has occurred as of late has been high-profile in nature and included potentially revolutionary software , computer processing , and communications capabilities , including those that can literally upgrade an aircraft’s systems while they are in flight, as well as cutting-edge artificial intelligence initiatives . Matt Hartman Regardless, we don’t know what the February 4 mission was all about, but it certainly included a grand tour of the state’s major population centers and didn’t include the usual grid-like flight patterns we are accustomed to seeing during the Dragon Lady’s high-flying surveillance test flights. Still, the detailed images of this exact U-2S landing at Palmdale do tell us how the aircraft was equipped for the curious sortie. The U-2’s flight path over Southern California on February 4th. , ADSBExchange.com Most notably, the Dragon Lady in question featured a panoramic camera system installed in its Q-Bay, which is located behind the cockpit and under the fuselage. The panoramic camera takes images that span from horizon to horizon, and thus covers huge swathes of the surface of the earth in a single pan. By its very nature, these sensors collect overhead and oblique imagery. The U-2 is literally a transformer. It can be reconfigured in so many ways, depending on the mission., DoD Updates in digital sensor technologies and computer processing have allowed for these types of sensors’ images to be integrated together more seamlessly, far faster, and with better overall ease for intelligence exploitation. Some also still use film. Either way, these systems can provide continuous panoramic map-like images of very large areas. We can’t say for sure what camera system this was, but it looks very similar to what is known as the Optical Bar Camera (OBC), which is a legacy payload option on the Dragon Lady. It can take these panoramic images in long continuous strips, which would make sense if you look at this U-2 mission’s track. An OBC being loaded onto a U-2S in South Korea. , USAF A technician works on an OBC. Note the characteristic blue-coated optical aperture. , USAF It could also be a similar system too, possibly one that is more advanced, leveraging the latest optical capabilities and digital-backend processing. Regardless, we know it is panoramic in nature and sure looks identical to the OBC. You can read a lot about OBC’s in this posting . Matt Hartman Matt Hartman Matt Hartman Matt Hartman Matt Hartman Matt Hartman Matt Hartman It’s also worth noting that this U-2 is carrying the hard-to-miss, dorsally-mounted Senior Span/Spur satellite communications data-link system as well as what appears to be a signals intelligence gathering capability. There are also a number of ventral aerials and one on the right wing-mounted superpod that are usually associated with a part of the full Senior Glass signals intelligence suite. Part of what makes the U-2 a modern marvel to this very day is just how brilliantly modular and adaptable it is. You can read all about the U-2’s various intelligence-gathering configurations in this past piece of mine. Here is Matt Hartman’s account of the encounter with the interestingly equipped Dragon Lady, which included its Q-Bay payload that seemed to still be actively scanning: It was a typical morning out at PMD (Palmdale Airport) just north of LA. Some C-130s were doing touch and goes, T-38s from nearby Edwards AFB were buzzing overhead—the usual stuff for a Thursday. That is except for the U-2 that had departed Palmdale earlier in the morning. This U-2 had a unique mission that day that took it up to Sacramento and then south, all the way to just near Tijuana, Mexico. It basically went on a long tour of California. At a perch of around 60,000ft above the earth, it covered almost every single major city in California. Upon return to Palmdale, It became very clear this wasn’t a usual U-2 flight we are accustomed to seeing. Upon its low pass over runway 07 at Palmdale, I realized that this U-2 was in the “Senior Span/Spur” configuration, but something else was different. Under the chin and below and to the rear of the cockpit, there was a sensor/camera. It appeared to be scanning the earth, left to right in motion as the U-2 descended on final for runway 07. The blue mirror-like lens was easily seen scanning the ground below it. On its back, this U-2 also had its Senior Span/Spur dorsal pod with a gold stripe around it, which was a first for me. Also of note, this U-2 was hiding its true identity. This U-2 has the serial number 80-1090 with a hex code of AE0964. This was NOT how it showed on all the popular aircraft tracking sites. It showed as 68-10336 with the hex code of AE094B during its flight. In the east, U-2’s I have tracked all have had this “default” serial and hex code, even though it’s incorrect. Very Odd indeed. Upon landing, I was able to get more of a look at the shiny blue lens scanning away at the ground below. Then the Dragon Lady touched down and taxied away to its hanger. The fact that the panoramic camera was still going about its oscillations even as the aircraft was about to land is interesting. One would think that the system would be shut down after collection has occurred. While we can’t say just how unique the configuration is, it isn’t all that common to see stateside. As to what the U-2 was up to that day, we have no idea, but testing new sensors, subsystems, and communications architectures is what the test unit at Palmdale is all about. At least it provided some nice photos that remind us just how versatile the Dragon Lady some 65 years since after she first took to the skies.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 25, 2021",Russia Is Extending One Of The Runways At Its Syrian Airbase,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery that The War Zone has obtained of Russia’s Khmeimim air base outpost in Syria shows work ongoing to extend one of its two main runways by around 1,000 feet. The extension would allow the base to support more regular deployments of larger and more heavily-laden aircraft, including heavy airlifters and even potentially bombers. Khmeimim, situated in Syria’s coastal Latakia governorate, has been a major hub for the Kremlin’s military intervention in that country, which began in 2015. Two years later, the Russian government signed a new long-term lease for the base with Syrian authorities, as part of a larger deal that also saw Russia extend its access to port facilities at Tartus , further to the south, for at least another 49 years. This arrangement came after Russian forces, especially combat airpower, had been instrumental in preventing the collapse of the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. A Russian Su-24 Fencer combat jet takes off from Khmeimim., TASS At the same time, the base also presents a strategically valuable airfield outside of Russia that can support broader military activities, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. For instance, the base provided a useful intermediate staging point for MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters and Su-24 Fencer combat jets that Russia sent to Libya to bolster forces aligned with rogue General Khalifa Haftar , which is engaged in a civil conflict with the country’s United Nations-recognized and predominantly Turkish-backed government . You can read more about that in these past War Zone stories . The base, which has two parallel runways that run north-south, has already seen major expansions and additions since Russian forces first arrived there in significant numbers six years ago. Starting in 2015, substantial portions of the installation have been effectively rebuilt or otherwise substantially improved, including expanded helicopter facilities, support infrastructure, and defenses. This included the addition of an approximately 819,000-square-foot ramp with direct access to the eastern runway that was completed in 2016, as well as a row of hardened aircraft shelters at the northwest corner of the facility that was built between 2018 and 2019 in response to the threat of drone attacks and other indirect fire weapons . Between New Year’s Eve 2017 and the end of the first week of January 2018, the base was subjected to at least two mass drone attacks , that killed multiple personnel and damaged or destroyed a number of aircraft.

REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The satellite imagery that The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, which is dated Dec. 14, 2020, shows that extensions are being added to both ends of the western runway, bringing it from its previous length of approximately 9,500 feet, as it had been since 2015, to around 10,500 feet. A taxiway also appears to be being constructed to link the northern ends of the base’s two runways. It’s possible that the full length of the runway will ultimately be even longer given what could be preparations for a further additional section across what is now a road at the northern end of the base. If this is indeed the full planned length of the runway, it could add around another 750 feet.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION The extensions appear to be outgrowths of resurfacing work that began in 2017, which looks now to be close to completion. Runway improvement efforts over the years have also included the construction of three new taxiways linking the base’s two runways together at various points. Runway resurfacing work seen underway in satellite imagery of Khmeimim from December 2019. The subsequent extension work had not yet begun at this time, though the same kind of concrete tiling is now being used for the additions., Google Earth These three taxiways linking Khmeimim’s two runways were added as part of runway improvement efforts between 2015 and 2017, Google Earth The western runway, as a whole, has been ostensibly closed to flight operations since 2016, with “X” markings appearing at either end that year, though satellite imagery has shown aircraft on it since then. When it formally opens in its extended form, it will represent a significant expansion of the overall base’s capabilities. An Il-76 cargo aircraft seen on Khmeimim’s ostensibly closed western runway in satellite imagery from May 2018., Google Earth Russia’s larger airlifters, including massive An-124s , have already made many trips to Khmeimim, but the longer runway could allow them to fly in and out of the base at greater gross weights, especially during hotter times of the year. This means that these aircraft will be able to bring in more cargo and passengers on each flight, streamlining routine operations to the base, which serves as an important logistical conduit for Russian forces throughout Syria. The extra runway would also provide better safety margins for rejected takeoff situations. An extended runway would also enable individual cargo aircraft to bring in larger payloads on short notice to support planned surges in operational activity or respond to sudden changes in fighting in the country. It could also provide a useful intermediate staging point for heavily-laden Russian airlifters, none of which are aerial refueling capable, headed for other countries in the region, such as Libya, and beyond. The extension and rehabilitation of the western runway at Khmeimim could also be envisioned as a way to better accommodate any of Russia’s current trio of bombers , the Tu-22M3 , the Tu-95MS , and Tu-160 . Russia has employed bombers over Syria in the past, but has done so through long-range strike or cruise missile launch sorties that see them fly circuitous round trip routes from its own territory. In 2016, it also deployed Tu-22M bombers to a base in Iran to support its Syrian campaign. Tu-22M3 bombers at Hamadan Air Base in Iran in 2016., AP https://youtube.com/watch?v=I4IKAqeEzgw Having the ability to stage bombers at Khmeimim, even on short-duration employments, would offer a much less politically complex basing alternative for employing these aircraft in the ongoing fighting in Syria. At the same time, routine bomber deployments to the base would also provide valuable strategic power projection. Bombers, as well as long-range Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft , which are based on the same design as the Tu-95MS bomber, flying sorties out into the Mediterranean, especially, could present new challenges for NATO on its southern flank. Russian bombers, flying from Khmeimim and armed with cruise missiles would be able to hold targets in Europe at risk from an entirely new southern vector and could also engage naval assets in the Mediterranean during any potential conflict. Those aircraft would also be better postured to respond to crises and contingencies in the Middle East and North Africa. Russia has already demonstrated an interest in being able to push bombers beyond its borders in recent years, including to other locations with strategic significance , notably Venezuela , to the chagrin of the United States. There are certainly questions about the ability of Khmeimim’s other facilities to handle any massive additional influx of bigger aircraft, whether they be cargo planes or bombers. The eastern ramp is presently the primary place where any sort of larger aircraft, also including A-50U airborne early warning and control aircraft and Il-20 spy planes , park now. Older satellite imagery shows that even after that ramp was built, An-124s still used the closed western runway to unload cargo, before the resurfacing work appeared to put an end to that, as well. A view of the eastern ramp at Khmeimim on Dec. 14, 2020, showing three white Il-76 airlifters, a gray A-50U airborne early warning and control aircraft with its radar dome clearly visible, and what appears to be an Il-20 turboprop spy plane at the top right corner. Another Il-76 is visible on a separate ramp that larger aircraft sometimes use to left., PHOTO © 2021 PLANET LABS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION An An-124 aircraft unloads its cargo on the western runway in October 2016. At that time the runway was marked as closed for flight operations and the large eastern ramp had been completed and was in use., Google Earth At the same time, the extension of the western runway could very well be followed by a similar improvement project for the eastern runway, as well as other construction elsewhere on the base. There is certainly space for development with the base’s existing perimeter, though the entire facility is situated within a populated area and it could be more difficult to enlarge its overall size. Regardless, the ongoing construction that is visible now only underscores the continued importance of Khmeimim to Russia, both for its ongoing efforts in Syria and beyond. The runway extension and any other subsequent efforts to expand the base would only help grow its overall strategic significance for the Kremlin. There are already indications that, while fighting is certainly still going on in Syria, that the Russian presence in Latakia has become steadily more regularized over the past six years. This could further point to a long-term vision on the Kremlin’s part that sees Khmeimim continue to evolve into a more general-purpose Russian military outpost abroad. “At this spot where we are now there was only an impenetrable thicket and these white concrete lego-like modular houses. Here, on an asphalt square, we began to deploy the food battalion and the lunchroom,” Igor Tsaryov, the Russian Deputy Chief of Staff for Khmeimim’s material and logistics services, said in an interview with state-run media outlet TASS last fall. “You can see the stark contrast. Today, it’s a flourishing garden.” “The flights are not as intensive as before. Flying today is much easier,” a Russian pilot identified only as Ivan also told TASS for the same piece. All told, it’s long been clear that the Kremlin has every intention of staying at Khmeimim for decades to come, but the new construction also indicates that plans are afoot to significantly expand its role in Russian military operations in the region and beyond, which could cause increasing concern for Moscow’s NATO foes.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 5, 2021",Majority Of Voters Don’t Want Billions Spent On New ICBMs To Overhaul America’s “Nuclear Sponge”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force continues to move ahead with plans to replace its LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles with the future Ground Based Strategic Deterrent , or GBSD, at a total cost of around $264 billion . But, in the opinion of U.S. voters who responded to a recent poll, it’s not necessarily the right move and most of them think that alternative options should be pursued. The poll was undertaken by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) think tank, together with ReThink Media. The sample-set was 800 registered U.S. voters who had been asked for their opinions on America’s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force last October. It was conducted online and has a confidence interval (similar to a margin of error) of +/- 3.4%. The survey found that 64 percent supported delaying the GBSD, as part of an overall review of that program, while initiating a service-life extension effort for the current Minuteman III missiles. Meanwhile, 60 percent supported one of any various “alternative policies” to deploying the future GBSDs. Technicians connect a re-entry system to a spacer on a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile during a test last September, at a launch facility near Great Falls, Montana., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Daniel Brosam The idea of a service-life extension for the Minuteman III ICBMs, as an alternative to the GBSD, received support from 30 percent of the voters polled. Meanwhile, 26 percent of those questioned supported the complete replacement of the Minuteman III, 20 percent supported the elimination of U.S. ICBMs altogether, and 10 percent opted for eliminating all nuclear weapons from the U.S. inventory The poll included an oversampling of 200 voters in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming, where intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are currently based. These are the “nuclear sponge” states , accommodating the missile fields whose job it is to suck up enemy warheads that could potentially be used on other targets and require the enemy — Russia — to invest heavily into the ability to neuter America’s ICBM force. They also offer a static nuclear strike option that can be activated and deployed against targets around the globe quickly. The GBSD, also known as the LGM-182A, is currently in the early developmental phase, with Northrop Grumman having received the engineering, manufacturing, and development contract last September. The program calls for the replacement of the Minuteman IIIs with more than 650 new ICBMs, with the first new missiles expected to be deployed from 2029. We don’t know a great deal about exactly how the GBSD will improve on the existing Minuteman III, but among the advances, the new missile is supposed to offer are the Mk 21A reentry vehicle, which will carry a W87-1 nuclear warhead, both of which you can read more about in detail here . A Boeing GBSD data slide, prior to that company leaving the bidding process., Boeing Importantly, Defense News points out that the question regarding GBSD included one particular piece of information that may have influenced the respondents’ answers. This was the statement that the contract “is being awarded to a single company, which is highly unusual because a lack of competition generally means that program costs increase significantly.” This reflects the fact that Boeing left the competition in 2019, in reaction to its rival Northrop Grumman’s acquisition of rocket motor manufacturer Orbital ATK, providing what Boeing thought was an unfair advantage. As a result, Northrop Grumman was left as the sole bidder. A Minuteman III missile receiving upgrade., U.S. Air Force The Pentagon has argued that the Minuteman III, which first became operational in the early 1970s, is now too old to be further upgraded in a cost-effective manner and that the GBSD needs to be pursued as an essential part of the U.S. defense infrastructure. Indeed, the new administration under President Joe Biden has already made moves committing itself to the primacy of the nuclear triad itself — ICBMs, nuclear-capable Air Force bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Biden’s choice for deputy defense secretary, Kathleen H. Hicks, who will be responsible for nuclear modernization decisions, told lawmakers during a February 2 confirmation hearing that she is committed to all three legs of the nuclear triad. “The triad has been… the bedrock of our nuclear deterrent,” Hicks said. “And I think it must be modernized in order to be safe, secure, and credible. I don’t think we should be risking the modernization of our deterrent.” However, the enormous costs associated with the U.S. government’s overarching nuclear modernization program — which, beyond GBSD, also includes the Air Force’s future B-21 Raider stealth bomber , Long-Range Stand-Off missile , and B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb , as well as the U.S. Navy’s hugely expensive Columbia class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), among others — are sure to be a central point in the next Nuclear Posture Review, which President Joe Biden’s Administration will no doubt start work on soon. With that in mind, the future of the nuclear triad could still be up for discussion. There have in the past been attempts to challenge GBSD, including a proposal last summer to redirect $1 billion from the program to a pandemic preparedness fund. That plan was defeated by a significant majority within the House Armed Services Committee. “There’s a reason why a majority of poll respondents supported alternative policies to the GBSD, and it’s the same reason why a growing number of top military and civilian officials are openly questioning the program today: These missiles no longer play a role in addressing the most important security challenges of our time,” Matt Korda, one of the pollsters for the FAS, said. “Is this truly the best investment in our collective safety that we could be making right now? Our survey results suggest the opposite.” On a military level, the arguments against ICBMs are many-fold and are something that The War Zone has discussed previously . The aforementioned “nuclear sponge” argument posits that Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming would soak up hundreds of enemy warheads during a conflict, reducing the ability of the enemy to strike elsewhere. While this might save the United States from direct attacks on a number of secondary targets in populated areas, the effects of hundreds of thermonuclear weapons detonating over the central part of the country would be cataclysmic, regardless. Nevertheless, the idea of a “nuclear sponge” has proven pervasive. For example, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, speaking back in 2017, referred to it explicitly when he visited U.S. Navy submariners at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State. “The ICBMs, because an enemy would have to shoot so much to take them out, you know because they’re are dug in underground, it’s going to soak up a lot.” He added that “I think we’re going to keep all three legs of the deterrent.” Official Air Force graphics showing the distribution of ICBM fields between missile squadrons under the control of, left to right, the 341st Missile Wing in Montana, the 90th Missile Wing in Wyoming and Nebraska, and the 91st Missile Wing in North Dakota., U.S. Air Force It has also been argued that ICBMs serve as “insurance policy” against the other two legs of the triad experiencing technical failure or being knocked out before they can launch their deadly payloads. However, the second-strike deterrent relies primarily on submarines, not on ICBMs, making such an argument questionable at best. Ultimately, compared to ballistic missile submarines, or even to Chinese or Russian road-mobile systems , silo-based ICBMs are far less survivable. Meanwhile, the ground-based leg of the triad lacks the flexibility of the nuclear bomber leg, which can offer a tailored response, can be deployed as a show of force when required, and is recallable. The specific doctrine behind the ICBM force is almost exclusively focused on deterring near-peer nuclear states, such as Russia and China, as well. Meanwhile, the ICBMs themselves are not presently postured to hit anything . Instead, they are all targeted, by default, out to sea, as a failsafe against accidental launches that could trigger a nuclear war. Despite this, a launch alone could still potentially start a nuclear exchange, especially during a time of heightened tensions. The last Nuclear Posture Review , in 2018, also pointed to the traditional nuclear triad as being too slow and inflexible to actually deter an opponent. Still, it called for work on GBSD to continue, alongside other nuclear modernization efforts, including the B-21 bomber, the B61-12 nuclear bomb, and the LRSO cruise missile. Concept artwork of the forthcoming B-21 Raider stealth bomber., NORTHROP GRUMMAN Although the New START treaty, the premier nuclear arms reduction agreement between the U.S. and Russia, has recently been extended for another five years , should it expire at the end of that period, giving up the ICBM force could be a massive negotiating chip to persuade Russia to give up similar capabilities, as well as others that are exotic in nature and hard to outlaw under existing treaty frameworks. The money saved in axing the GBSD could, moreover, be invested elsewhere, significantly overhauling other areas of the U.S. military, whether related to nuclear deterrence or otherwise. The new Columbia class SSBNs also don’t come cheap , with concerns frequently voiced about the funding needed to keep that program on track. Last year, the presidential budget put an estimated cost of $14 billion on the first Columbia class submarine, with total procurement costs for all 12 SSBNs at $110 billion. What is more, removing the ICBM force would also free up more “deployed warheads,” as they are defined under New START, permitting additional ballistic missile submarines and bombers to be deployed. There is a potential, however, for the GBSD to become more flexible in the future, with thought already being given to potentially integrating new kinds of capabilities that are absent from the Minuteman III. In particular, the Air Force is known to have been researching what it might take to develop a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle with a range equivalent to a traditional ICBM. One option would be to place such a vehicle on top of the GBSD, which might change the discussion around how ICBMs fit into the nuclear triad. The debate surrounding modernizing America’s ICBM force isn’t an all or nothing proposition, either. Significantly reducing the number of new ICBMs that will replace the Minuteman III inventory is a compromise offer, albeit one with somewhat diminishing returns. This latest poll suggests that a majority of U.S. voters have, at least, reservations about the replacement of existing ICBMs with the GBSD. Still, it remains to be seen if the program will be reassessed under the next Nuclear Policy Review, or whether the Pentagon will remain wedded to its nuclear triad under the still very fresh Biden Administration.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the west, the B-52 Stratofortress gets a ton of attention for its antique status, with its first flight dating back to 1952, yet Russia’s Tu-95 Bear has been around just as long , and like the B-52, it still serves as the backbone of Russia’s strategic air forces. While the B-52H that is still in service features a chorus of eight low-bypass turbofan TF33 jet engines, the Bear does its thing with a quartet of massively powerful turboprop engines, a fascinating accomplishment to ponder, especially nearly 70 years since it first took to the skies. Its four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines crank out a whopping 15,000 horsepower each and push contra-rotating propellers that force the Bear along at jet speeds. Those engines and propellers also give the Tu-95 family one of its most notable features—a deafening mechanized orchestra blast. Case in point, the video clip below, which appears to show a Tu-95MS Bear-H taking off from an airbase somewhere in Russia. The audio is absolutely tooth-rattling and offers a fascinating impression of just what the Bear can sound like to those on the ground nearby during terminal operations—a mix of standard jet engine howl with an exotic and unsettling high-frequency roar: There are plenty of stories of fighter pilots intercepting Bears and hearing and even feeling the drone of their engines over their own jet engine noise and through their cockpit canopy enclosure and helmets. Also, it has been claimed that submarines can hear the Tu-95’s maritime patrol cousin, the Tu-142 , at ridiculously long ranges on their passive sonars.

This comes amid a resurgence in interest in submarine-hunting capabilities within the U.S. military, as well as its allies, in recent years, as potential underwater threats, especially from Russia and China , continue to grow. The maritime division of U.K.-based firm Ultra , which provided the sonobuoys and related signal processing systems, worked with Northrop Grumman on the test, which took place on Oct. 29, 2020 , off the coast of southern California. A modified manned Bell 407 helicopter stood in for an MQ-8C during this event. This variant of the Fire Scout is based on the Bell 407 design. An MQ-8C Fire Scout drone helicopter., USN “Adding an ASW [anti-submarine warfare] capability to Fire Scout’s existing multi-mission capabilities would further enhance this highly-versatile platform,” Dan Redman, Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout Maritime Mission Expansion Lead,  said in a statement. “This ASW capability would offer commanders flexibility to employ not only UAS systems in this particular ASW role, but also utilize the increased availability of crewed aircraft more incisively against an expanded mission set. This would increase the total available effect of the manned/unmanned teamed force mix.” “Operating prototype hardware in a high-pressure real-world environment can be challenging,” Thomas Link, the President of Ultra Maritime, added in the same press release. “Our partnership will bring an innovative and leading ASW capability into operation, combining both manned and unmanned ASW systems that will help defend our warfighters and provide increased capability to our forces.” It’s not clear what type or types of sonobuoys the surrogate helicopter deployed during the test, or how many it dropped in total. Northrop Grumman has released concept art, seen at the top of this story, showing an MQ-8C carrying two dispenser pods, each with 24 cells, on a plank-type mounting system running through the center of the fuselage. However, a picture the company released from the October demonstration, seen below, indicates that the surrogate helicopter carried a single dispenser system under the central fuselage. A Bell 407 helicopter acting a surrogate for an MQ-8C drone drops a sonobuoy during a test in October 2020., Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman did say the sonobuoys were “used to conduct a large area multistatic acoustic search.” Ultra offers multiple types of multistatic acoustic sonobuoys with active or passive sonars. “Ultra makes about 90% of all the sonobuoys used in the West,” Redman, the Northrop Grumman’s Fire Scout Maritime Mission Expansion Lead, told Jane’s in a subsequent interview . Passive types have sensors to passively gather acoustic data, while active sonobuoys send out sonar “pings” to search for submarines and other objects of interest underwater. You can read more about how sonobuoys are employed in hunting for enemy submarines in this previous War Zone story . “The mission payload and effects were controlled from the ground with the resultant ASW picture disseminated to locations across the globe,” Northrop Grumman added in their press release. The company said that the U.S. Navy was not directly involved in the test and “has not yet identified a clear requirement for UAS [unmanned aviation systems] ASW capability,” but “has shown interest in the development and continues to support and monitor progress.” This overall test is similar in many respects to one that General Atomics carried out off the coast of Southern California in November of last year, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . In that instance, an MQ-9A Reaper dropped three different kinds of sonobuoys, including ones with active and passive sonars, as well as a bathythermograph type designed to detect objects through changes in water temperature, during a simulated search for an enemy submarine. An MQ-9A Reaper drone with a sonobuoy dispenser under its wing during an anti-submarine warfare demonstration in November 2020., General Atomics There are significant potential benefits to adding the ability to drop sonobuoys, as well as process and disseminate the information they collect, to the MQ-8C. This version of the Fire Scout, a completely different design from the earlier MQ-8B , which is larger and more capable, is presently configured to perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and help acquire targets for other platforms, as well as support command and control and communications relay missions. Northrop Grumman says the drone helicopter can remain airborne for at least 12 hours at time. The Navy, which declared initial operational capability with the MQ-8C in 2019, typically deploys these drones together with manned MH-60R Seahawk helicopters on various types of warships. The Seahawk helicopters can also deploy sonobuoys, as well as hunt for submarines using dipping sonar. They are also now slated to receive magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD), which will offer another means of detecting potential underwater threats. An MH-60R Seahawk helicopter employs a dipping sonar system., USN MQ-8Cs loaded with sonobuoys would offer a way to more rapidly expand the size of the overall array, making it more difficult for a hostile submarine to escape. The buoys also have limited battery life and there is a need to reseed arrays during protracted operations, another role an anti-submarine warfare Fire Scout could assist with. All of this, of course, could free up manned MH-60R helicopters, as well as the crews of other anti-submarine warfare aircraft and ships on the scene, to focus on specific contacts. A single MH-60R can only be in one place at once, as well, so MQ-8Cs being able to help at all would add valuable additional submarine-hunting capacity , too. Improvements in artificial intelligence and machine learning could help the MQ-8Cs process the data they receive from the sonobuoy arrays and do so rapidly. This could also allow them to weed out unwanted data and false positives before even passing anything along to human anti-submarine warfare personnel, reducing their workload and otherwise speeding up the search process. There’s also the possibility that MQ-8Cs could prosecute threats directly, either with some some level of engagement from a human operator or entirely autonomously based on a defined set of parameters. Northrop Grumman has already demonstrated the ability of a Bell 407 helicopter acting as a surrogate for a Fire Scout to employ a miniature torpedo, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . A Bell 407 helicopter drops an experimental miniature torpedo during a demonstration in 2016., Northrop Grumman Regardless of how interested the Navy may be in adding anti-submarine warfare capabilities to its MQ-8Cs now, the service is only looking to expand its arsenal in this regard in general, amid concerns about the growing threat of Russian and Chinese submarine fleets and other underwater capabilities . These two countries, among other potential adversaries, are working steadily to expanding their undersea fleets, including with more modern types designed specifically to be quieter , and, as a result, harder to detect and track underwater. It is interesting to note that the Navy recently announced its desire to acquire a replacement for its MQ-8B and C Fire Scouts, as well as its MH-60R and S Seahawks , starting in the mid-2030s. Anti-submarine warfare was one of the mission sets that the service said it was looking for any future manned or unmanned helicopter to perform. Still, an anti-submarine warfare kit for the MQ-8C could be a very viable way to expand the Navy’s sub-hunting capabilities in the near term.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on Feb 3, 2021",Sweden’s Bigger Badder Gripen Fighter Packs A Lot Of Punch In An Incredibly Efficient Package,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For a country with a population of just over 10 million people, it’s impressive that Sweden is able to maintain an indigenous fighter aircraft program that is first and foremost designed to meet a domestic need. The Saab Gripen is a small and versatile fighter that meets a very specific Swedish requirement, but its mantra of being “affordable” doesn’t mean it compromises on lethality. In fact, the latest Gripen E variant includes features that could help to inspire others’ future fighter plans . The Gripen E might look and feel much the same as previous models of the fighter, but it’s such a significant advance that manufacturer Saab even considered giving it a totally new name. The E-Series, as it is now dubbed, builds on the lineage of the original Gripen A single-seat and B two-seat variants. The Gripen C/D is its direct predecessor, and although the single-seat E-model looks externally very similar to its forebears — it’s a very different beast in several ways. The first serial production standard Gripen E (6002) first flew in November 2019., Jamie Hunter Gripen E origin and innovation The first prototype Gripen E made its maiden flight from Saab’s Linköping facility on June 15, 2017. The aircraft is slightly larger than the C-model at just under 50 feet and includes a beefed-up fuselage that accommodates approximately 30 percent more fuel. The aircraft also features larger air intakes, the more powerful General Electric F414-GE-39E engine, and a total of 10 hardpoints. A two-seat F-model is now in development for Brazil , which currently has 36 E/F variants on order as the first export customer for the latest versions. December 2020 saw the first of a planned 60 Gripen Es being handed over to the Swedish Air Force to commence the joint test program for verification and validation between Saab, the Swedish Armed Forces, and FMV, the Swedish procurement agency. This manner of joint testing is seen as an important way for Saab to closely monitor the needs of Sweden’s frontline forces — something it takes very seriously as it rolls-out a near-continuous series of upgrades to meet the latest requirements. “Every year we aim to fly for a few weeks with an operational Gripen squadron,” Saab Gripen E test pilot Robin Nordlander told The War Zone . He started out as a pilot in the fighter variant of the popular Viggen in the Swedish Air Force and has been a test pilot with Saab for 14 years. “Flying with a squadron allows us to maintain our operational perspective, and gain insights into the latest ways that air force pilots are using the aircraft. That gives us the best advantage to ensure our developments are based on actual requests from the operational community.” “In the development of the Gripen E-Series, we have aimed to maintain that heritage from the Viggen, through the Gripen A/B, and the C/D development because we are confident of a product that is competitive in the operational arena.” The Swedish Air Force recently announced that the C/D variant will remain in operation past 2030 to help streamline the introduction of the new E-Series from 2023. Saab test pilot Robin Nordlander climbing into a Gripen E., Jamie Hunter “We must look to the future to develop every area of Gripen as much as we can,” Nordlander continues. “Gripen E’s 30 percent more fuel means extended range, and that has a huge impact for the pilot. We also increased the payload with the two additional hardpoints, and added new sensors and weapons.” The Gripen E can carry up to seven MBDA Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, it features the Leonardo ES-05 Raven Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, and the Leonardo Skyward G infrared search and track (IRST) sensor. The new Electronic Warfare System (EWS) is a feature that Saab is especially proud of, and it features a 360-degree spherical Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS). It is the Gripen E’s avionics architecture that is particularly noteworthy. Saab claims that its design is nothing short of revolutionary. It is configured to enable the rapid insertion of new hardware and updated software applications to embrace new missions. This is an area in which Saab says it has invested enormously in developing. The computers themselves can be swapped out quickly to allow constant increases in processing power. It also means that customers can design and develop their own software, enabling the rapid introduction of new technologies and systems to deal with ever-evolving threats without hardware impeding progress. Saab says it is actively working towards avionics and mission systems that are adaptable on the battlefield so that an operator can fight ‘day one’ of a conflict, learn, and then adapt by adding new or adapting existing software applications to give a combat advantage for ‘day two.’ It’s the kind of agile avionics performance that is being mandated for U.S. manufacturers as the military seeks to field smaller fleets of “Digital” fighter aircraft far more swiftly and apply new capabilities to new and existing types extremely fast, with software updates even potentially occurring while the aircraft is in flight . Radar on a swashplate and integrated IRST Alongside its impressive avionics, the Gripen E totes some very high-end sensors. It was the first fighter aircraft to feature an AESA radar mounted on a rotating repositioner or swashplate. This enables the electronically scanned antenna, which is normally fixed in a forward position on fighter aircraft, to be slewed to the left and to the right in order to increase its field-of-view. “The swashplate makes it possible to have a 140-degree search volume within a 200-degree look-angle around the nose of the aircraft,” explains Nordlander. “As well as scanning directly ahead, the swashplate allows the aircraft to scan further to the left and right, in fact, you can actually “look” aft left or aft right with the radar. This is a huge benefit during BVR [Beyond Visual Range] engagements or in a GBAD [Ground-Based Air Defense] environment when you don’t want to point the aircraft directly into a specific area.” Explaining the merits further, Nordlander states: “You want to minimize the potential for an opponent to launch [a missile] toward you — and with the swashplate arrangement you can actually fly slightly away from an area of interest, while still looking with the radar into that area. So, if I am defensive and just looking into an area I can turn away or remove my velocity into that area, but still scan it. If I am offensive and want to make a long-range missile shot against a target, I don’t have to close on the opponent after my shot and give them the possibility to launch [a missile] against me. With the swashplate, I can “crank” [turn] away from the target more than 90-degrees and still maintain a lock with the radar. That’s especially powerful when combined with the [Meteor] air-to-air missile.” This Gripen E is loaded with seven MBDA Meteor missiles., Saab The duo of the Meteor missile and the AESA radar on a swashplate is a powerful combination for the Gripen E. Theoretically the pilot can fire missiles at enemy fighters at extreme ranges and then hide in their radar’s “doppler notch,” while still guiding missiles to their intended target. The potency of this type of arrangement has led to some fighters incorporating side-facing cheek-mounted radars, such as what’s seen in the Su-57, allowing them to employ similar tactics. You can also read more about Gripen’s AESA swashplate arrangement here . Essentially, the Gripen’s AESA means the aircraft can still guide a long-range missile shot while “beaming” into the enemy’s ‘doppler notch.’ Beaming is when a fighter turns approximately 90 degrees away from the enemy’s pulse doppler radar array to fly perpendicular to it. Fighter radars use doppler shift to gauge a target’s relative velocity, filtering out low relative velocity objects, particularly things like ground clutter. The beaming fighter, which is not moving toward or away from the enemy radar while flying perpendicular, can enter the enemy ‘notch’ — potentially rendering it invisible or at least hard to keep an engagement-quality lock on. You can read more about this tactic here. It has been officially stated by Saab that the company has a strategy of trying to counter the benefit of stealth design technology in a threat aircraft. The use of an IRST is part of the overall sensor suite that is designed to help the Gripen partially remove the cloak of a stealthy platform. The Gripen E’s IRST is located ahead of the windscreen., Jamie Hunter “The IRST is part of the equation, but we are also doing a lot of radar work connected to algorithms. It’s about processing very small signals, finding the difference between what is a target, what is background noise, and what is a bird, for example. Today, our work with algorithms means we are able to detect contacts that are around 10 times smaller compared with just a few years ago. So, yes we are working to counteract stealth, and that’s not just with an infrared sensor, because stealthy platforms employ IR reduction techniques — it’s about combining our sensors to achieve this .” The first Gripen E for Brazil was shipped from Sweden to South America by sea, arriving on September 20, 2020., Saab/Linus Svensson Electronic warfare cloak Gripen E itself does not feature geometric stealthy design features, with Saab’s view that with software and hardware technology changing at such a rapid pace, stealth aircraft will ultimately become more visible to radars. As any airframe is very hard to change or reconfigure in the future, without enormous time and cost, Saab decided the better approach is to stay in-step with the competition by using rapidly evolving technologies other than stealth to help win the war, such as advanced electronic warfare. Designing and fielding low-observable aircraft such as the F-35 comes at an extremely high cost. It also takes a lot of maintenance to keep a stealthy aircraft flying in a combat-ready state. The Gripen is designed to be rapidly deployable in the field at austere bases with a small logistics footprint and maintained by a small team that can quickly service and regenerate fighters. “With Gripen, you do a turnaround within 10 minutes if you’re doing air-to-air [missions] — you do the refueling and re-armament — and that is building sortie generation so that we can perform a lot of missions in a defined period of time,” commented Saab’s Magnus Skogberg. Using the “cloak” of an advanced and reconfigurable electronic warfare system rather than investing in an inherently stealthy — but far more costly — configuration supports Saab’s philosophy of presenting a price tag that Sweden, and its customers, can afford. One of the aces up Gripen E’s sleeve is therefore its electronic warfare system or EWS. It’s completely new in the Gripen E and provides what Saab refers to as a “digital shield.” The idea was to continuously and exponentially grow and develop the system to meet future threats. The embedded EWS combines active and passive systems to help protect the aircraft, which is combined with a 360-degree spherical missile approach warning system. “All modern fighter aircraft carry some form of EWS,” says Nordlander. “In some environments, you need to be electronically silent, and our EWS together with the IRST provides the ability to image and track objects passively. This is a critical factor because it means you can divide your formation into groups that are active — with their radar working for example — and groups that are passive, and we can share data between the elements.” “The most impressive part of our new EWS is the resolution and sensitivity. When it comes to detecting and identifying contacts, this part of the overall mission system is vital and one of our most advanced features. As a pilot, I want 360-degree coverage all around me, and I want high resolution and seamless fusion with my other sensors. The EWS must work as an integrated part, whether I am flying offensively or defensively. I need to know if a radar is tracking me, for example, or if a missile has been launched at me.” “Gripen E’s EWS includes powerful active electronic and passive countermeasures to handle any situation, so I can pop out defensive aids that have a passive action initially, then they can activate an active element.” Systems such as the Leonardo BriteCloud are a good example of the kind of technology now being employed that build on the legacy chaff and flare systems. Note the wingtip pods associated with the electronic warfare system on the Gripen E., Jamie Hunter Advanced cockpit and sensor fusion Monitoring all of these advanced systems, the pilot sits in front of a completely new cockpit layout. After much deliberation, the Swedish Air Force decided to follow Brazil and opt for a single Wide Area Display (WAD) in the Gripen E. This is an evolution over the three large displays in the Gripen C/D cockpit. “The WAD adds huge possibilities for the pilot regarding situational awareness and the ability to act on this,” says Nordlander. Saab has spent a tremendous amount of time fuzing the Gripen E’s range of sensors and presenting swathes of data to the pilot in an uncomplicated and intuitive manner. “We have chosen to have a map across the entire area of the display, and have your position shown wherever you want it to be, but to start with it is centered. The modern battlefield is geographically huge and the pilot needs situational awareness over a vast area. So on the map, we have overlaid mission routes, other platform detail, and all relevant objects in the air and on the ground.” A Gripen E pilot wearing the Targo II helmet and manipulating the Wide Area Display., Jamie Hunter “The WAD has touchscreen functionality, and the pilot can create regions of different sizes and various information. Sensor views can be overlaid and can vary in size and zoom. In the Gripen C, we found that pilots change map scaling a lot because you may have detailed interest in one area, simultaneously with the need to monitor a zoomed out larger area — in Gripen E we increase the SA with the possibility to overlay one or several maps of selected areas and zoom level.” “Our testing has found that the possibilities with the WAD presentation are almost too flexible, so we are recommending default setups that mean the pilot actually decides and pre-selects these in the mission support system [MSS] on the ground, then they can swap between them during the flight. You can create a table in the MSS then fast access in the aircraft as to how you want WAD to look. Then you can deviate from those main set-ups if required.” Nordlander says the Gripen E test team is carefully proceeding with how it introduces the new display. “There are touch functions that may or may not be used by the pilot, and there will be times they want to use HOTAS [Hand-On Throttle And Stick], push a button, or turn a knob. We would never accept functionality only via touch.” Saab has chosen the Targo II Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for the Gripen E. Unlike the F-35, for example, the cockpit blends the HMD and WAD with a Head-Up Display (HUD). “We prefer the redundancy of a large HUD and an HMD. We had a lot of discussions, but we weren’t ready to go with a non-HUD layout [as in the F-35]. Also, sometimes pilots may want to fly the jet without having to wear the HMD, so we offer choice.” A Gripen E test pilot wearing the Targo II Helmet Mounted Display., Jamie Hunter “We have a lot of experience that has evolved through the years when it comes to Human Machine Interface [HMI]. In the Gripen, this is designed to select and filter critical items for the pilot. For example, we don’t show engine RPM [Revolutions Per Minute], we don’t show which tanks the fuel is in unless required. If the system is working perfectly well, it won’t tell the pilot anything. We have automated a lot of the functionality in the system. This is a huge step forward in performance and how we use the system.” “The pilot is able to select the level of automation they want, based on the scenario. In Gripen C we have already gone with this principle. So a pilot can select to use systems manually, semi-automatic, or totally automatic. It means the pilot can decide that they want to monitor and manage everything, select to approve or reject suggestions from the system, or do what is best according to the system. This information is presented via symbols on displays, by sounds, or by speech messages, depending on the mode. Essentially, we are trying to make it as easy as possible for the pilot to make critical tactical decisions.” Saab explains that it sees Human-Machine Collaboration as the next step in ensuring that the platform and pilot work together, further enhancing the possibilities of sensor fusion, adaptability to missions, and even learning. “When it comes to sensor fusion, this is all about maintaining the absolute maximum situational awareness. You can have the greatest kinetic performance in the world, but without situational awareness, you’re a sitting duck. In Gripen E we talk about transparent fusion. I need to know what sensors/platforms are providing which data and what the quality of that data is, to be able to make the best possible decision! It is also crucial to know what the opponent knows about me, in the decision making.” The Gripen E Wide Area Display being evaluated in a simulator., Saab “We also have a fusion between platforms. In Sweden, we started flying with a fighter-to-fighter data link at the beginning of the 1980s in the Viggen. The idea came from being outnumbered by an opponent, so we created it as a force multiplier in order to share information — to see what your wingman sees. This created a tactical behavior and a lot of experience which has helped us to create a system that is able to cope with a far more complex tactical situation.” “We also use onboard simulation/calculation from the mission data to provide the pilot with suggestions for the best course of action. Depending on the opponent, it can tell the pilot when the other aircraft may have a launch opportunity on them, and things like if they crank left now, for example, what would happen. It’s extremely enhancing as an operational feature. So a pilot doesn’t just look at the displays and work out for themselves if they are in danger, or not, the aircraft can actually inform and suggest actions to the pilot, kind of like a what-if , all the time.” A Gripen E during testing in Sweden., Jamie Hunter When it comes to training, the Gripen also includes embedded synthetic training scenarios. So a single ship can go out and fight a simulated bandit in a Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air-to-air fight, for example. “We don’t need to have all of those entities airborne,” Nordlander explains. “Because most modern air forces don’t have an unlimited number of airframes, we need to be able to create complex large formation situations, without necessarily having all those assets in the air. It’s all part of the embedded synthetic training in the Gripen E, so we can mix live and synthetic.” “We don’t only have air targets, we can also include simulated Ground-Based Air Defense [GBAD] systems and ground targets, and all of this can be pre-programmed in the MSS. So a squadron can fly a single or two-ship mission, and have that formation countered by GBADS, simultaneously with a synthetic BVR scenario. So, if you can only go out and fly a single ship, you’re not limited to just flying loops all day!” A Gripen E during testing and fitted with an IRIS-T missile., Jamie Hunter A wolf in sheep’s clothing The Gripen has sometimes attracted criticism over raw performance. It’s a small airframe that can be called upon to lug heavy load-outs. The Gripen E is heavier than its predecessor, with additional pylons, and increased fuel capacity, but this is offset by an uprated engine in the shape of the GE F414, versus the F404 in previous models. “I’ve been here at Saab Flight Test for 14 years and we get a lot of foreign evaluator pilots visiting. They often comment after they have flown the Gripen that the performance numbers cannot be correct,” says Nordlander. “The reality is that as far as I know, no one has been able to minimize drag the way we have with the Gripen. It’s all about the flight control software and what we can do with the aircraft configuration with the canards and delta wings working together. The intelligent flight control system is always trimming the aircraft for the least drag, in every flight regime. This means the 22,000 pounds thrust of the F414 in the Gripen E has greater value than the published numbers suggest.” Nordlander says the Gripen E was designed to match, and where possible exceed, the performance of the Gripen C, despite the increase in size and weight. “We have not lost anything in terms of performance,” he asserts. “In fact, in a clean or light fighter configuration without heavy external stores, the performance is actually better than the Gripen C. At high all-up weights with more hardpoints, more fuel, and more stores, we have not lost anything. Sometimes it is impossible for the pilot to detect if there is a store on the aircraft or not. In fact, if I am flying in a configuration with a few missiles, I cannot feel the difference in performance and handling qualities over a completely clean jet.” Robin Nordlander at the controls of a Gripen E., Jamie Hunter So, while the Gripen E-Series might look similar to earlier versions of the fighter, it is a measurably different beast. It perhaps deserves to be known as the Super Gripen, given that its advance is akin to how the F/A-18 Hornet evolved into the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet . Swedish industry has a reputation for quietly going about its business, and Saab has focused its efforts on creating a fighter that must be affordable, without impeding quality. The Gripen doesn’t require huge servicing infrastructure, it offers excellent availability, and it can be supported by a small team of maintainers. Those traits alone combine into a highly attractive proposition in an age where the newest combat jets can be ready to fly a combat mission in as little as half of the time. While the Gripen E-Series was born in an age where stealth fighters are proliferating around the globe, it offers a well-rounded array of higher-end capabilities in a relatively small, mature, and simpler package. As such, this wolf in sheep’s clothing has a lot to howl about. Contact the editor: Tyler@thedrive.com Jamie Hunter Contributor Air Air Force Munitions Air-To-Air Fighters Gripen Meteor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 22, 2022",China Claims It Has Conducted A New Midcourse Intercept Anti-Ballistic Missile Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but the Chinese government says that it has carried out an anti-ballistic missile test. State media reports say that the goal was to demonstrate capabilities to intercept an intermediate-range ballistic missile , or IRBM, during the midcourse portion of its flight . However, these kinds of interceptors can also double as anti-satellite weapons . China’s Ministry of Defense announced the test on Feb. 4, 2021, and said it achieved all of its goals , but offered no additional details, including whether an actual intercept of any kind had taken place. Chinese authorities also insisted that the test was purely defensive in nature and was not meant a signal to any country in particular. A screengrab from a video that may show a Chinese anti-ballistic missile interceptor test on Feb. 4, 2021., via Twitter Unconfirmed video of a possible rocket or missile launch emanating from northern China has emerged on social media. The clips are similar to imagery that appeared online after another anti-ballistic missile test in 2018, but are also what one would expect to see from any large rocket or missile launch. If this footage is from this test, it could indicate a launch from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province, which is also a major Chinese ballistic missile test facility.

There are only three of these aircraft in total, which are specially configured to gather telemetry and other electronic intelligence, from missile and other large rocket launches, making them very-low-density, but high demand assets. USAF RC-135S is patrolling to the south of the Bohai Sea, near the Jiaozhou peninsula of China's Shandong, and one tanker KC-135T is coming to support it. pic.twitter.com/3oyMcM2bva — SCS Probing Initiative (@SCS_PI) February 3, 2021 The appearance of one of these aircraft, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece , in any particular area can often be a sign of an imminent missile test. Flying in this particular area of the Yellow Sea would have put the RC-135S as close as possible to Taiyuan while remaining in international waters. The 2018 test was also described as being a demonstration of midcourse ballistic missile intercept capabilities. So far, China has not yet released any specific details about work on such an interceptor, including any official designation. The country is “developing kinetic-kill vehicle technology to field a midcourse interceptor, which will form the upper layer of a multi-tiered missile defense,” according to the most recent annual public report from the Pentagon on Chinese military capabilities, which it released last September . A “kinetic-kill” interceptor, also known as a hit-to-kill type, is designed to destroy its target by physically slamming into it, rather than via a traditional warhead or some other kind of effect . The U.S. military’s own Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) interceptors, a test of which is seen in the video below, use a kinetic kill vehicle. Difficulties in the development of that vehicle have become a major issue for the GMD program in recent years. The interceptor itself only one part of the puzzle of midcourse ballistic missile defense, which you can read more about broadly in this previous War Zone piece . This involves detecting, tracking, and then engaging longer-range ballistic missiles, including IRBMs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCM), after they “go cold” from entering the vacuum of space, as well as discriminating between them and any decoys. This presents significant challenges and requires a robust, multi-layered sensor network that would include assets in space, in addition to ones on the Earth’s surface. Interesting, after the 2018 test, a story in the People’s Daily newspaper in China, an official media outlet of the Chinese Communist Party, including the graphic below outlining the principles of midcourse ballistic missile defense using components of the U.S. military’s system, including the GMD interceptor, Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX), a portion of the land-based Solid State Phased Array Radar System ( SSPARS ), and a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. In recent years, the U.S. military has continued to work toward adding additional sensor nodes , especially in space , to its overarching missile defense ecosystem. A graphic on midcourse missile defense that the People’s Daily newspaper included in a story about an anti-ballistic missile defense test in 2018., People’s Daily In addition, it’s important to point out that the line between midcourse ballistic missile interceptors and anti-satellite weapons is extremely thin. The U.S. government has gone so far as to accuse China of using such ballistic missile defense tests as cover for anti-satellite weapon testing in the past. It may well be that China’s midcourse interceptor is an extension of work the country had done on the Dong Neng series of anti-satellite interceptors, which themselves use boosters from ballistic missiles, such as the DF-11 . Reports have said that Dong Neng-3 (DN-3) was the interceptor employed in the 2018 test, reportedly knocking down target in the form of a DF-21 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). China is also known to be working on a surface-to-air missile system, the HQ-19, which reportedly also has some degree of exoatmospheric intercept capability. Reports also indicate that the Dong Neng-2 (DN-2), as well as another interceptor, known as the SC-19, can also engage targets in space. An image of what may be a Dong Neng-series interceptor based on the DF-11 ballistic missile., Chinese State Media The HQ-19 is also known to the U.S. Intelligence Community as the CH-AB-X-02, with the X indicating that it is still assessed to be experimental and not fielded operation. However, that naming convention would suggest the existence of another anti-ballistic missile defense interceptor, the CH-AB-01 or CH-AB-X-01, which could refer to this midcourse interceptor. Regardless, it’s not hard to see how China would be interested in both midcourse ballistic missile defenses and improved anti-satellite capabilities. The Chinese government faces potential threats from India’s ballistic missile arsenal , as well as potential new ballistic missile and ballistic missile-based hypersonic weapon developments in South Korea and Japan . There is also the matter of the United States, which is in the process of modernizing its strategic ballistic missile systems. The U.S. military is also now also exploring the possibility of acquiring new IRBMs , and potentially MRBMs , following the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, with Russia, with a specific eye toward deploying them on China’s doorstep in the Pacific. Space is also an area where there are growing concerns of potential conflict . The U.S. military, in particular, has come to heavily rely on space-based systems for a wide variety of functions, including early warning , intelligence gathering , weapon guidance and basic navigation , and communications and data-sharing . All of this has only incentivized potential adversaries to develop ways to destroy or disable American satellites , or those of its allies and partners , to neutralize those capabilities. You can read more about all of this in these previous War Zone stories . It’s also worth pointing out that the U.S. government has been increasingly willing to publicly call out what it assesses to be anti-satellite tests in recent years. All told, it will certainly be interesting to see what details emerge about this test and times goes, including from sources outside of China, especially the U.S. government.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Dec 2, 2020",Russia Developing First Brand-New Short-Range Air-To-Air Missile Since The End Of The Cold War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The leading developer of air-to-air missiles in Russia has revealed that it is working on what seems to be a new short-range air-to-air missile type. This weapon would appear to be related to a previous design that would have provided performance at least equal to that of the American AIM-9X Sidewinder or the European Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or ASRAAM . The revelation appeared in a recent edition of the in-house magazine of the Vympel missile design bureau. This Moscow-based firm is responsible for designing almost all of Russia’s air-to-air missiles, from short-range to long-range designs, and is a part of the country’s Tactical Missiles Corporation (KTRV). The same article which looks back on the company’s achievements in 2020, was republished yesterday on the website of the Center for Analysis of Strategy and Technologies (CAST), a Moscow-based defense industry and arms trade think tank. In this corporate publication, Vympel confirmed that it’s carrying out research and development work on a project named Izdeliye 300M — izdeliye, meaning “article” in Russian, is a prefix applied to most in-development Russian missile programs, while the M suffix denotes a design that’s been “modernized.” A Russian Su-30SM Flanker during a mission over Syria. The jet is armed with medium-range R-27R (inboard) and short-range R-73 or R-74M missiles (outboard and wingtips)., Russian Ministry of Defense “This year, a range of scientific research and design work was undertaken within the future development foundation with the aim of creating a scientific-technical section for future innovations within the State Arms Order, and also boosting the export potential of the articles delivered by the company,” the article states. “The new work in the future development foundation includes the creation of an outline for the future Izdeliye 300M, research on ballistic characteristics of articles with combined engine [propulsion] installations, and also experimental evaluation of the effect of changes in antenna arrays on the main characteristics of radar seeker heads.” It should be noted that those three items are understood to be three different programs, with the propulsion and radar seeker parts of the work not being related to the Izdeliye 300M. The article also notes that Vympel has been working on these projects with “various industry scientific-research organizations,” as well as the Moscow-based Bauman State Technical University , which is described as Russia’s oldest and largest technical university. While the Izdeliye 300M designation seems to be new, it clearly suggests a continuation of an earlier advanced short-range air-to-air missile program, the Izdeliye 300. This latter emerged at least as long ago as the 1990s and was alternatively known as the Vympel K-30. It was intended to supersede the Vympel R-73, known in the West as the AA-11 Archer. An AA-11 Archer missile streaks off an underwing pylon, as seen from the cockpit of a Russian Su-30SM fighter., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CAPTURE When the R-73 first entered Soviet Air Force service, in 1983, it soon established itself as a very capable short-range air-to-air missile. Its combination of an all-aspect infrared seeker, high off-boresight capability, thrust-vectoring controls, and the fact it could be cued by the pilot’s helmet-mounted sight made it an immediate threat and ensured it would be an influential design. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, many thousands of R-73s were manufactured, almost exclusively for export, including for China and India. The missile has seen combat in the hands of various export operators and a Russian MiG-29 Fulcrum used the weapon to down one of Georgia’s Israeli-made Hermes 450 drones over Abkhazia in March 2008. However, the Russian military has long sought a successor to the R-73, the advantage of which has long since been eroded by the appearance of the AIM-9X Sidewinder from American defense contractor Raytheon, European missile consortium MBDA’s ASRAAM, and others. A follow-on to the R-73 finally appeared in the shape of the Vympel R-74M, development of which began in the mid-1980s, but which did not officially enter service until 2012. Looking almost identical to the R-73, the R-74M is distinguished by its new two-band infrared seeker. This results in increased seeker range and an expanded off-boresight capability, reducing the possibility of the enemy aircraft escaping it in a tight-turning dogfight. The R-74M program, however, ran into problems after the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, followed by Moscow’s support of separatists in Ukraine’s eastern provinces. The Ukrainian Arsenal company, which provided the seeker for the R-74M, ended its cooperation with Vympel. Despite efforts to launch production of the same seeker at a factory in Russia, this has apparently proven impossible to achieve. RVV-MD is the export name used for the Vympel R-74M. The abbreviation denotes “short-range air-to-air missile” in Russian., Rosoboronexport In place of the R-74M, Russia instead switched its focus to the K-74M2 (the K suffix denotes a missile that is still in the development phase), which is optimized for internal carriage by the Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter . As well as being more compact to fit in the weapons bays, the K-74M2 importantly adds a seeker from the Russian Azov AOMZ company, plus a rocket motor with increased burn time, for longer range. The weapon can also be fired in lock-on-after-launch mode, which is typically required when launched from an internal bay, the missile beginning its flight under inertial control before achieving an in-flight lock-on. This sequence may or may not show the launch of a K-74M2 from one of the Su-57’s two small wing-root weapons bays., RUSSIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CAPTURE So far, then, Russian efforts to replace the R-73 have concentrated on further evolutions of the R-73/AA-11, rather than an all-new design. In contrast, the Izdeliye 300/K-30 was to have been a “clean-sheet” missile, and the recent disclosure from Vympel suggests strongly that it is now back in development in a revised form. A display of missiles at the Vympel design facility. From top to bottom, the missiles are, an unconfirmed new design , an R-74/K-74, and an R-77, as well as a gray launch rail., ANTON NOVODERESHKIN/TASS While Vympel has yet to release more details about the new Izdeliye 300M, the original Izdeliye 300 was expected to include a new imaging infrared seeker that would have enabled targets to be acquired twice as far away as compared to the original R-73. This would imply a maximum seeker range of between 12.4 to 15 miles, compared to 6.2 to 7.5 miles for the R-73, based on publically available figures. Imaging infrared seekers are by now a regular feature of Western heat-seeking missiles, offering much better resistance to countermeasures, among other enhanced capabilities. The Izdeliye 300 would also have featured a more powerful dual-pulse solid-propellant motor, and an all-moving nozzle for thrust-vector control, rather than the paddle-type vanes used on the R-73. What little we know about the appearance of the is based mainly on unofficial artworks, which suggest a slender weapon with cruciform tailfins. The image below purports to show a mock-up K-30, but probably, in fact, depicts the Gran from the Ukrainian Luch design bureau, another weapon that seems to have been derived from the original Izdeliye 300 design, but which adds long-chord narrow-span cruciform wings on the body. Development work on a new Russian short-range air-to-air missile would be timely, due to the age of the R-73 and the limited numbers of weapons of any type in this class that has been produced for the Russian military, as opposed to export. A production version of the Izdeliye 300M would likely be sized for internal carriage by the Su-57 and perhaps also the Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). In this previous article, you can read about how the Okhotnik was reportedly flight-tested with air-to-air missiles for the first time last year. Russia hopes to have the combat drone service as early as 2024 . With the Okhotnik combat drone now reportedly undertaking air-to-air missile trials, the Izdeliye 300M could provide it with future armament., YOUTUBE SCREENCAP Of course, a new short-range air-to-air missile could also arm the existing fighter jets in the Russian inventory and may also prove popular as an export product, continuing the success of the R-73 but offering capabilities far better to rival weapons in its class. As Russia continues to seek export customers for the Su-57, the availability of a new-generation short-range air-to-air missile with which to arm it would provide a useful selling point, especially as new generations of medium- and long-range weapons are already available. A prototype Su-57. The first production aircraft was handed over to the Russian Aerospace Forces at the end of December 2020., MARINA LYSTSEVA/TASS VIA GETTY IMAGES There is also the question of the shelf-life of Russia’s existing stocks of short-range air-to-air missiles. While it is unclear how many examples of the R-74M have been built, it seems the K-74M2 has not yet entered quantity production. There are much larger stocks of R-73s, but many of these are now getting very old and may no longer be viable for use. Reportedly, 6,000 examples of the R-73 were produced annually until the early 1990s, but after 1992, almost all of these missiles were manufactured for export. We don’t know for sure the shelf life of an R-73, but unconfirmed reports suggest it may be around eight years, and this figure would be rapidly reduced if the missile were to actually be carried on an aircraft. For comparison, the more modern AIM-9X Block I was designed with a 20-year service life assumption. The exact status of surviving R-73s in the Russian inventory is unclear and it is possible that many of these have been carefully handled and their service lives extended, while the amount of “flight time” they have accumulated has been kept to a minimum. Even if that is the case, and with Russia having struggled to introduce a truly modern indigenous seeker on the interim R-74M, a new-generation short-range air-to-air missile is clearly a high priority. For now, more precise details of the Izdeliye 300M remain unavailable. The fact the manufacturer has highlighted its existence is significant, however, and the available evidence suggests that Russia is finally moving closer to completing an all-new short-range air-to-air missile.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2021",Turkey Prepares To Extend The Life Of Its Massive F-16 Fleet After F-35 Embargo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than three decades of service, the Turkish Air Force ’s F-16 Viper fleet is perhaps more important than ever. A structural improvement program is underway to ensure these fighter jets can remain in service even longer. The Vipers will fill the gap left by Turkey’s ejection from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the pending arrival of an indigenous replacement, the TF-X . Ismail Demir, head of Turkey’s Presidency of Defense Industries, also known by the Turkish acronym SSB, recently confirmed via Twitter that work is continuing on structural improvements for some of the oldest F-16s in the Turkish Air Force inventory, namely the Block 30 jets that began to be delivered in 1987. SSB is responsible for managing the country’s arms manufacturing and military procurement. A Turkish Air Force F-16C approaches the tanker on a training mission., Turkish Ministry of Defense “In the project, where engineering works are carried out for the renovation and revision of 1,200 to 1,500 structural parts per aircraft, repair, and replacement and fuselage reinforcement applications are carried out where necessary,” Demir explained. “We aim to increase the structural life of our F-16 aircraft, the main striking element of our air force, from 8,000 hours to 12,000 hours.” 1️⃣ F-16 Blok 30 uçaklarının yapısal iyileştirmeleri sürüyor.

That initiative is intended to keep the jets flying until nearly 2050 . Sheet metal mechanics work on an F-16 wing at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, during structural-strengthening modifications as part of the U.S. Air Force F-16 Service Life Extension Program, or SLEP., U.S. Air Force/R. Nial Bradshaw The third-largest F-16 fleet in the world, behind only those of the United States and Israel , Turkey’s Vipers have repeatedly proven their worth in combat operations and any replacement for them is some way off. It’s for these reasons that the F-16s are continuing to receive this service-life extension, performed by the domestic firm Turkish Aerospace, formerly known as Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). Exactly how many jets are being processed is unclear. In the past, it was reported that the structural life-extension work covered all 35 surviving Block 30s, with work beginning in 2018. Under this program, Lockheed Martin was supplying upgrade kits, while Turkish Aerospace would complete the modifications and undertake testing prior to their return to the Turkish Air Force. However, Defense News recently reported that an upgrade program has now been extended to cover “more than 160 F-16 Block 30/40/50 aircraft.” This is from a total of 270 F-16s of all versions that were delivered to Turkey, minus any attrition. According to data provided by Flight International’s World Air Forces 2020 publication, Turkey currently has 245 F-16s of all types in service. F-16Cs refuel from a Turkish Air Force KC-135 tanker., Turkish Ministry of Defense It could also be the case that the figure of “more than 160” relates to a separate modernization program, which was reportedly performed on 163 Block 40/50 jets. This effort provided those jets with the Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) upgrade, which you can read more about below, and which was completed in 2015. The Turkish F-16 saga The very earliest Block 30 jets that were earmarked for the structural life-extension work were delivered under the Peace Onyx I Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, after Ankara selected the F-16C/D as its new fighter in 1984 and ordered 160 examples. From the start, Turkish industrial cooperation was built into the program and what was then TAI was contracted to assemble 152 of the F-16s, being responsible for 70% of each of the jets, including the center/aft fuselage and wings. The jets’ General Electric F110 engines were also assembled locally. From the Peace Onyx I aircraft, the first 43 were completed to Block 30 standard, while the remaining 117 were Block 40s that could be fitted with LANTIRN pods for navigation and targeting, providing a day/night and all-weather attack capability. Deliveries were completed in 1995. A contract for Peace Onyx II was signed in 1992, even before the first batch of 160 Vipers had been delivered and covered another 40 F-16C/Ds, now of the more advanced Block 50 configuration, to be assembled by TAI. Funding for this project came from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, in recognition of Turkey’s support during the 1991 Gulf War. The final jet was handed over in 1997. Two Turkish Air Force F-16Cs prepare to depart on a training mission., Turkish Ministry of Defense Another batch of 40 Block 50 F-16C/Ds was ordered in the mid-1990s, under Peace Onyx III, and there were primarily intended as attrition replacements. These jets were delivered between 1998 and 1999. The next significant development in the Turkish F-16 saga was the 2005 decision to upgrade existing jets with the aforementioned CCIP package. Lockheed Martin modified 10 aircraft itself before supplying kits to Turkey. These kits included the mechanically scanned AN/APG-68(V)9 multi-mode radar, a new mission computer, color cockpit displays, enhanced horizontal situation indicator, the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), Link 16 data link capability with the Multifunctional Information Distribution System to increase pilot situational awareness and communication, new air-to-air interrogator, and compatibility with several new targeting systems and weapons, including the AIM-9X air-to-air missile and the Sniper targeting pod. The latest Turkish F-16 order was Peace Onyx IV, with an FMS deal for 30 Block 50+ F-16C/Ds signed in 2008. These are the most advanced Turkish Vipers to date and were assembled on the reopened TAI production line between 2010 and 2012. These jets are known to be compatible with a number of indigenous weapons, including the 1,300-pound Roketsan Stand-Off Missile (SOM). https://youtube.com/watch?v=DOOlA_EU8Ns Turkish Vipers in action Turkish F-16s have seen considerable combat action throughout three decades of service, including regular sparring with Greek fighters over the Aegean. You can read more about this longstanding confrontation between two NATO members here . Turkey’s F-16s saw their first official combat action over the Balkans during NATO’s Operation Deny Flight in 1993 during which the jets were deployed to Italy to enforce a United Nations no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. This deployment was expanded in 1999 for Operation Allied Force when NATO forces launched an air war against Serbia to protect the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo. Turkish F-16s have seen considerable use flying airstrikes against the Kurdish Workers’ Party militant group, also known by the Kurdish acronym PKK, and have also downed both Russian and Syrian combat aircraft that have strayed into Turkish airspace during the campaign in Syria. A Syrian Mi-17 Hip helicopter was shot down in September 2013, followed by a MiG-23 Flogger fighter jet in March 2014. In November 2015, a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-24M Fencer strike aircraft was shot down . In March last year, F-16s downed another two Syrian Su-24s and a Syrian L-39 combat trainer. An impressive lineup of Turkish F-16C/Ds, 270 of which were delivered in total., Turkish Ministry of Defense The Viper played a significant role also in the failed coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016. Since personnel from the F-16 base at Ankara-Akinci were accused of conspiring against the regime of President Recep Erdogan, many were reportedly imprisoned, and the airbase’s resident Viper wing — consisting of three squadrons — was closed down. Its aircraft were dispersed to other bases. More recently, Turkish F-16s seem to have played a role in last year’s war in Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Ankara supported Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia. Satellite imagery confirmed at least two F-16s in Azerbaijan on October 3, after fighting broke out in the region . However, both Azerbaijan and Turkey rejected Armenian claims that one of its Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft was shot down by a Turkish F-16 on September 29. All in all, and despite Turkey’s increasing use of drones for combat missions, the F-16 remains a backbone of the country’s defense strategy, equipped for air-to-air, air-to-ground, and reconnaissance missions, the latter with the DB-110 pod . The jets are expected to protect the frontiers to Syria, Iraq, and Iran, as well as deal with the PKK operating inside Turkish territory and outside its borders. On top of this, the jets play a vital role in the Aegean theater, where tensions with Greece have recently been on the rise. No successor in sight At one time, the Turkish Air Force expected to receive 100 F-35As as part of a significant modernization effort that would also have included the gradual drawdown of the F-16 fleet. Turkish Aerospace also had a major role in the industrial side of the Joint Strike Fighter program, producing fuselage sections for the jets. These ambitions came crashing to earth after Ankara was thrown out of the Joint Strike Fighter program in July 2019 for refusing to abandon its planned purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems. In these previous War Zone articles, you can read about the U.S. Senate’s efforts to block the transfer of F-35 to Turkey, and how the Pentagon went about “unwinding” Turkey from the program . The unveiling of the first F-35A planned for Turkey, in June 2018., ANADOLU AGENCY In particular, the United States and other countries involved in the Joint Strike Fighter program were concerned that Turkey’s acquisition of the S-400 could provide the Kremlin with an avenue to acquiring sensitive information about that aircraft and its capabilities. Now that the S-400 has been delivered to Turkey, it’s not the F-35, but the F-16 (and the veteran F-4E Phantom II ) that have been tested with the radars associated with the new Russian surface-to-air missile systems. The activation of the air defense systems has, in turn, led to U.S. sanctions placed on Turkey . As for the F-4E, despite significant indigenous upgrades, the days of the aging fighter jet in Turkish service are surely numbered. Only a single squadron of the Phantoms remains and the aircraft has probably only been spared retirement due to the non-arrival of the F-35. A formation of Turkish F-16Cs (top two in the stack) and F-4Es (bottom two)., Turkish Ministry of Defense The end to Turkish prospects of receiving the F-35 also led Russia to tout its Su-57 Felon new-generation fighter to Ankara as an alternative . The head of Russia’s state-run industrial conglomerate Rostec stated that it was ready to cooperate with Turkey on the export and production of the Su-57 to fill the hole left by the F-35. Turkish President Erdogan joined his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the MAKS air show outside of Moscow in August 2019 and looked over the Su-57 and made an offhanded comment about buying the Russian-made jets during the event. So far, however, there has been no sign that Turkey might actually place an order for Su-57s. Presidents Erdogan and Putin look over a Su-57 prototype at the MAKS air show in August 2019, MIKHAIL VOSKRESENSKIY / SPUTNIK VIA AP Instead, the focus seems to be placed on Turkish Aerospace’s indigenous TF-X project for a new-generation, a full-size mock-up of which was unveiled at the 2019 Paris Air Show and which you can read about in detail here . At the time of its unveiling, the firm’s President and CEO Temel Kotil said the goal was to have built a prototype by 2023 and achieve the first flight with the aircraft in 2025. The TF-X mockup at the 2019 Paris Air Show., Turkish Aerospace Developing a homegrown stealthy combat aircraft is an ambitious undertaking for any country , but the TF-X faces additional hurdles, too, beyond the enormous costs and complexity associated with the program. First announced in 2010, the-then TAI won the contract to develop the aircraft in 2015. In October 2018, Turkish Aerospace selected the General Electric F110 engine to power the new fighter, this being the same engine that Turkey already assembled under license for the F-16. The breakdown in U.S.-Turkish relations makes the chances of such technology transfer much less likely. Instead, Ankara might have to look elsewhere to secure engines for the TF-X. Perhaps the most obvious option would be the United Kingdom, although Rolls-Royce has already clashed with the Turkish authorities over the transfer of sensitive technology and intellectual property rights related to the TF-X. However, in December 2019 Turkey reached out to the United Kingdom again, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu saying that the government wanted to move forward with its planned cooperation. Speaking in January last year, Sir Dominick Chilcott, British Ambassador to Turkey, seemed to suggest a British engine option was still on the table: “Our position is quite clear that we very much hope that Turkey will in the future look to its NATO allies, as the British ambassador looks to the U.K., for international defense industry collaborations, not to Russia,” he told members of Diplomatic Correspondent’s Association, as reported by Hürriyet Daily News . “The British government hopes Rolls-Royce will be the company working with Turkish partners to design and manufacture engines on this project,” he added. A Russian company may also stand an outside chance of supplying engines for the TF-X, although that country’s engine offerings have, at best, a mixed track record . The S-400 is also not the only issue that Turkey and the US have sparred over in recent years, too. The intervention in Syria in 2019 prompted calls for a full-on arms embargo from very powerful members of Congress . Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and major political ally of President Donald Trump, called for an arms embargo and a host of other sanctions against Turkey. Last December, under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, the United States put sanctions on the Turkish Presidency of Defense Industries in response to the country’s purchase of the S-400. As well as targeting important members of the country’s defense establishment, there are also provisions that could threaten Turkey’s ability to secure future defense-related export from the United States. Exactly how the current limitations on specific U.S. export licenses and authorizations will manifest themselves is not yet clear, but these aspects of the sanctions would appear to threaten the future supply of U.S.-made arms to Turkey, potentially including spares for its F-16s. A Turkish Air Force F-16D configured for a strike mission with a laser-guided bomb., Turkish Ministry of Defense Perhaps anticipating U.S. sanctions, Turkey reportedly began stockpiling spare parts for its F-16s in July 2019. The effort also included acquiring additional spares for other unspecified military systems beyond the Vipers. The previous month, lawmakers in the House of Representatives agreed to a non-binding resolution outlining a number of potential courses of action, which might impact other weapon system programs beyond the F-35. The F-16 was specifically mentioned, alongside the CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, and the UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter. At the time, The War Zone ’s Joseph Trevithick noted: Having parts in reserve would be especially critical for the F-16s, which are the Turkish Air Force’s most numerous and advanced combat aircraft and will continue to be so for years to come, especially in the absence of F-35 deliveries. Without these stockpiles, the Vipers could very quickly end up grounded, leaving Turkey in a particularly vulnerable position. Turkey could, in theory, continue to pursue its F-16 overhauls and other work without any U.S. approval, but that seems like a much more remote possibility that would only further aggravate tensions between Ankara and Washington. As yet, Turkey does not find itself in the position of Venezuela, which has attempted to keep its F-16s flying without any U.S. support, let alone Iran, which has continued to operate American-made fighter jets for many years despite sanctions. Things could of course change now that President Joe Biden is in the White House. It remains to be seen how he will approach U.S. relations with Turkey, or how things may or may not change under a Democratic-controlled Congress. At the same time, though, there has previously been considerable bipartisan consensus on penalizing Turkey over various issues, not least the S-400 acquisition. For now, at least, it is abundantly clear that the F-16 is an irreplaceable part of the Turkish Armed Forces. Efforts are being made to extend its service life and to ensure that there is a reserve of spare parts should the military relationship with the United States deteriorate further. In its favor, Turkey now has plenty of experience assembling, operating, and supporting a large Viper fleet and it should be no surprise if some of these jets are still in service to 2050 or beyond.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Greece and Turkey have a long history of animosity despite both being NATO members. However, there’s a real concern that the current spike in tensions — mainly related to control of oil and gas reserves and maritime rights in the eastern Mediterranean — could escalate. If they do, the respective air arms of the two countries are likely to be heavily engaged, so it’s a good time to take a detailed look at their respective assets and how their capabilities compare. It’s worth noting here that the Hellenic and Turkish Air Forces regularly spar over the Aegean Sea. Turkey and Greece broadly have a long history of confrontation, including an all-out war fought in support of competing factions in Cyprus in 1974 . That independent Mediterranean island, which is still divided between areas under the control of ethnic Greek and Turkish Cypriots to this day, remains a focus of antagonism between the two countries. However, current developments in the region have caused alarm in both NATO and the European Union. Latest developments The background to the current dispute surrounds the race to exploit energy reserves in the eastern Mediterranean . The two countries have claims on overlapping areas containing undersea oil and gas fields. In July, Turkey announced it was sending its research vessel Oruç Reis to carry out a drilling survey in disputed waters off the coast of southwest Turkey, but close to the Greek island of Kastellorizo. The Greek military was put on alert and the vessel eventually left port on August 10, 2020. NormanEinstein/wikicommons “The illegal and provocative behavior of Turkey has a serious backlash not only to peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean but to the cohesion of NATO and to its relations with the European Union,” said Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias , in response to the Turkish drilling mission. “Greece claims 40,000 square kilometers of maritime jurisdiction area due to this tiny island [Kastellorizo] and attempts to stop the Oruç Reis and block Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean,” declared Çağatay Erciyes , Director General at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The build-up to the latest phase in the standoff included a collision between Greek and Turkish frigates on August 12, 2020. The Turkish warship involved was one of five escorting the research vessel Oruç Reis . The Greek frigate Limnos made contact with its Turkish counterpart Kemal Reis and the resulting damage was apparently confirmed by photos published soon afterward in the Greek media. Complicating matters, some of the recent exercises in the area have involved foreign participation, including French Air Force Rafale fighter jets that arrived at Souda-Chania Air Base on Crete for joint training with Greek F-16s on August 13, 2020. The French Ministry of Defense described the deployment as a “temporarily strengthening [of] their presence in the eastern Mediterranean.” Souda then received four F-16E/F Desert Falcons from the United Arab Emirates, which had touched down at the Greek base by August 27 to take part in further joint exercises. On August 26, Greece began a naval exercise south of Cyprus involving forces from Cyprus , France, and Italy. At the same time, warships from Turkey and the United States were taking part in separate drills in the same area. The U.S. Navy has taken part in maneuvers with both the Greek and Turkish navies in recent weeks, including involvement from Greek F-16s and the U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Winston S. Churchill . The Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81) executes drills with the Hellenic Navy frigate Aigaion (F 460) in the Mediterranean, August 24, 2020. , U.S. NAVY/MASS COMMUNICATION SPECIALIST 3RD CLASS LOUIS THOMPSON STAATS IV As well as a war of words and aggressive acts between ships, there have been other examples of direct posturing, too. The Turkish Ministry of Defense released what it claims is footage from the head-up display (HUD) of one of its F-16 fighters showing an incident that occurred on August 27, 2020, in which six Greek F-16s were supposedly warded off by Turkish Vipers. According to a statement from the ministry, the Greek fighters launched from Crete and were heading towards southern Cyprus when they approached an area in which Turkey had previously declared a restricted zone for a naval exercise. The Turkish Ministry of Defense said the Greek jets were “removed from the region” and local media reported that the Oruç Reis was also active in the area at the time. The supplied HUD footage shows F-16s in a turning fight at close quarters and includes several tone alerts indicating that the Turkish pilot’s AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile (AAM) was locked on to the opposing F-16. The full story behind the incident is unclear, but encounters of this kind are not uncommon over the contested waters of the Aegean. However, by posting the video now, the Turkish Ministry of Defense seems keen to display its willingness and ability to take on Greek airpower to protect its interests in the region. The most recent altercations between Greek and Turkish forces, and the soaring rhetoric that has come with them, have been met with concern among the wider European Union, of which Greece is a member. The German Defense Minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has called for the situation in the Aegean to be “defused” and criticized the latest rounds of potentially provocative naval exercises staged by both countries in the area. Kramp-Karrenbauer’s words suggest there’s now a wider recognition that another incident could put Greece and Turkey on a more serious collision course again, including in the air. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on August 28, 2020, to talk about developments in the eastern Mediterranean. Stoltenberg stressed dialogue and de-escalation and the two discussed deconfliction mechanisms to prevent further incidents. For NATO, any tensions between Greece and Turkey threaten the solidarity of the alliance, potentially diminishing its ability to confront common security challenges. “We’re urging everyone to stand down to reduce tensions and begin to have diplomatic discussions” added U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo . “It is not useful to increase military tensions in the region.” After examining the background to the latest standoff, let’s look at the key combat aircraft types that make up the two countries’ respective air arms. F-16 The two countries’ air forces are spearheaded today by Lockheed Martin F-16 Viper fleets, which have now recorded three decades of service in Greece and Turkey. In both cases, the fighter jets were primarily purchased to replace aging F-104 Starfighters and F-5 Freedom Fighters. The Hellenic Air Force (HAF, or Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia) received 170 F-16s of various types between 1989 and 2010 and, with a large-scale modernization program underway, the Viper will remain the backbone of the air arm for many years to come. A Hellenic Air Force F-16C Block 50 in the markings of 341 Mira and armed with AGM-88 HARMs. , HELLENIC AIR FORCE Greek Vipers were acquired via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) channels, through the Peace Xenia program, which included four distinct phases. Peace Xenia I provided 34 single-seat F-16C and six two-seat F-16D Block 30 jets delivered between 1988 and 1990. Peace Xenia II added another 32 F-16C and eight F-16D Block 50 aircraft. These jets are capable of night attack missions with the LANTIRN targeting pod and have AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) capability, making them suitable for the suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (SEAD/DEAD) mission. Peace Xenia III provided 40 F-16C and 20 F-16D Block 52+ jets, all equipped with conformal fuel tanks for extended range. These were delivered between 2003 and 2004. After scrapping plans to purchase the Eurofighter Typhoon , the Greek government instead opted for another Viper order, under Peace Xenia IV, to replace the veteran fleet of A-7H/TA-7H Corsair II attack jets. The deal covered 20 F-16C and 10 F-16D Block 52+ Advanced versions, also sometimes referred to as Block 52M aircraft, and was signed in December 2005. The HAF’s aging F-16 Block 30s are now consolidated with a single squadron, 330 Mira, and the jets have undergone the Falcon UP service-life extension, work being undertaken locally by Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI). Of the 150 or so Vipers still operational, the bulk is divided among eight operational squadrons based at Araxos, Lárisa, Néa Anghialos, and Souda-Chania, but the HAF also maintains a number of rotational detachments on islands in the Aegean. All HAF F-16 squadrons maintain a full air-to-air capability and undertake quick reaction alert (QRA) readiness duties to counter potential Turkish airspace violations, despite the fact that some are specialized air-to-ground squadrons. The Collins Aerospace DB-110 reconnaissance pod is available to Greek F-16s for reconnaissance missions, and additional weapons options include the AIM-120C AMRAAM, AGM-154C Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), and — reportedly — Wind Corrected Munitions Dispensers (WCMD). Unusually, the HAF has opted for the pan-European IRIS-T as the primary short-range AAM for the Viper, rather than the AIM-9X Sidewinder . Eyeing a longer-term modernization for its Vipers, Greece selected the F-16V upgrade that will bring 84 aircraft — all of them Block 52+ and Block 52+ Advanced jets — to Block 70/72 standard , including the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar ( SABR ) with active electronically scanned array (AESA), Raytheon Modular Mission Computer, remodeled cockpit including the second-generation Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS ΙΙ), and the Link 16 data link, among other enhancements. Most of the work will be undertaken by HAI in Greece. There have been suggestions that the remaining 38 Block 50 jets could also undergo an upgrade, bringing them to a so-called Block 50+ Advanced standard, but this hasn’t been contracted. The fate of the Block 30 aircraft is unclear, but they could be sold off, or perhaps used as aggressors for air defense training. A Turkish Air Force F-16 pair heads out for a training mission, led by an F-16C Block 50., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE On the other side, the Turkish Air Force, or Türk Hava Kuvvetleri (THK), is the world’s third-largest Viper operator, with a total of 270 aircraft delivered in successively more capable Block 30, Block 50 and Block 50+ configurations. Local industry also plays a significant part in the Turkish Viper program, with involvement from Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) from the outset, including local assembly of aircraft and production of center/aft fuselage sections and wings. The Turkish Viper procurement took place in four phases: Peace Onyx I to IV. Under Peace Onyx I, Turkey received 136 F-16Cs and 24 F-16Ds, of which the first 44 were completed to Block 30 standard. The next 116 aircraft within Peace Onyx I were Block 40-standard jets that included the provision for LANTIRN pods. Deliveries took place from 1987. Peace Onyx II covered 60 F-16C and 20 F-16D Block 50 aircraft, which were delivered between 1996 and 1999. Like the HAF Vipers, Turkish F-16 Block 50s were provided with the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile. The Peace Onyx III contract provided another batch of 40 F-16C/Ds, intended as attrition replacements. These aircraft were delivered between 1998 and 1999. Turkish F-16s have also been subject to the Common Configuration Implementation Program (CCIP) upgrade. As well as adding more sophisticated weapons and sensors, this improved logistics support and reduced life-cycle costs. Lockheed Martin provided a total of 163 CCIP kits for Turkey’s surviving F-16C/D Block 40/50s. After modernization, the aircraft featured APG-68(V)9 multi-mode radar, color cockpit displays and recorders, JHMCS, Link 16 data link, Sniper targeting pods, and new weapons, including the AGM-84K Joint Standoff Land Attack Missile — Expanded Response ( SLAM-ER ), AGM-154A/C JSOW, AIM-9X , and CBU-103/105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispensers (WCMD). Other weapons available to Turkish Vipers include the AIM-120 AMRAAM as well as the AGM-65 Maverick TV-guided air-to-ground missile. The most recent Peace Onyx IV program provided another 14 F-16C and 16 F-16D Block 50+ jets, which are known to be compatible with the 1,300-pound Roketsan Stand-Off Missile (SOM) for standoff precision strike, as well as other indigenous weapons. These aircraft were delivered between June 2011 and December 2012. More recently, TAI has set about upgrading 35 of its oldest Block 30 Vipers. This is based around a service-life extension using kits supplied by Lockheed Martin. The status of this program is currently uncertain, with reports that the U.S. Congress may have blocked the contract in response to Ankara’s purchase of the S-400 air defense system. Today, the THK’s F-16C/D fleet is operated by two squadrons at Balikesir, two squadrons at Bandirma, two squadrons at Diyarbakir, one squadron at Eskişehir, one squadron at Konya, and two squadrons at Merzifon. Units are assigned particular roles, among them air defense, SEAD/DEAD, tactical air support for maritime operations, close air support, reconnaissance, and aggressor. Eskişehir is home to 113 Filo, a former RF-4E operator, which is assigned the DB-110 reconnaissance pod that is used with the F-16, four of these pods having been acquired. F-16 inventory (this and subsequent similar data is provided by Flight International’s World Air Forces 2020 publication): Greece: 153 Turkey: 245 Mirage 2000 The Hellenic Air Force also operates the Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter, having acquired two distinct versions of the delta-wing jet. The first order was placed for 36 single-seat Mirage 2000EGs and four two-seat Mirage 2000DGs and deliveries began in 1988. Although being used primarily for air defense, these aircraft can be armed with the AM.39 Exocet anti-ship missile. Afterburner take-off for a Hellenic Air Force Mirage 2000-5EG., HELLENIC AIR FORCE The HAF subsequently obtained a further 15 new-build Mirage 2000-5BG/EG (Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2) jets and brought 10 of its earlier aircraft to the same standard. One reason for adding the more capable Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2 may have been to match the beyond-visual-range capabilities of Turkey’s F-16s armed with AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. The French-made jets are armed with the MBDA MICA missile, available in both radar-guided and infrared-guided variants. The Greek Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2 jets also have an important long-range conventional strike role with the MBDA SCALP-EG cruise missile. A first airframe upgraded by HAI took to the air in 2005 and the first new-built fighters from Dassault began to arrive in Greece in 2007. The HAF’s Mirage fleet is divided between two squadrons based at Tanágra, and the jets also conduct rotational detachments to islands in the Aegean. Mirage 2000 inventory: Greece: 42 F-4 Phantom II As well as both flying the F-16, Greece and Turkey are among the last operators of the F-4 Phantom II. However, both countries have now retired their reconnaissance-configured RF-4 fleets. The Hellenic Air Force has a single unit operating F-4E fighters that were upgraded to Peace Icarus 2000 standard under the Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) between 1997 and 2001. Stationed at Andravida near the west coast of the Peloponnese peninsula, these jets are multi-role-capable, but it’s thought they now focus on air-to-ground missions. A Hellenic Air Force F-4E in its hardened aircraft shelter, armed with the Vietnam War-era HOBOS TV-guided bomb., HELLENIC AIR FORCE Among others, the AUP added AN/APG-65Y radar, inertial navigation system/GPS, AN/ALR-68(V)2 radar warning receiver, color multifunctional displays, a new head-up display, and hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls. The Rafael Litening II laser targeting pod provides day/night precision targeting and weapons include laser-guided bombs, AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, AIM-120 AMRAAM, and AIM-9 Sidewinder. While 33 of the 36 Greek F-4Es that underwent the AUP remain operational, it’s thought that around 20 are actually available for operations at any given time. Turkey’s Phantoms also underwent a significant mid-life upgrade, emerging as the F-4E Terminator 2020. The modernization involved Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) and covered 54 airframes, including structural and avionics work. The upgraded avionics include an Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode radar, digital glass cockpit, wide-angle HUD, and HOTAS controls. The jets can be armed with the Israeli-made Popeye standoff missile, as well as the indigenous Roketsan SOM for use against land and sea targets. Other stores include the HGK 500-pound INS/GPS-guided bomb, KGK 500-pound or 1,000-pound glide bomb, and the LGK-82 — an indigenous version of the 500-pound GBU-12 laser-guided bomb. A pair of Turkish Air Force F-4E Terminator 2020s. , TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE While both countries have made efforts to acquire new-generation fighters to modernize their fighter arms, Turkey was ejected from the F-35 stealth fighter program in response to its purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems. Greece, meanwhile, has been identified as a possible F-35 customer too, and more recently unconfirmed reports have emerged in the Greek press that the country is examining a potential purchase of 18 Rafale multi-role fighters . It was expected that the Turkish Phantoms would be retired with the arrival of the F-35, but with Ankara’s expulsion from the Joint Strike Fighter program, it’s possible the THK F-4s will continue in service until around 2030, by which time the next-generation TF-X fighter may be available. Today, the F-4Es serve with a single squadron at Eskişehir. F-4E inventory: Greece: 33 Turkey: 48 Airborne early warning and control Airborne early warning (AEW) is a critical function for modern complex air operations and both Greece and Turkey contribute to NATO’s E-3A Sentry Component , which maintains a pooled fleet of the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft at Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. The component also has forward operating bases at Aktion in Greece and Konya in Turkey. However, both countries have also established independent airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) capabilities. The EMB-145H combines the Ericsson Erieye AESA radar with the Embraer EMB-145 bizjet airframe. , HELLENIC AIR FORCE Greece opted for its own AEW&C solution in 1999 when it ordered four Embraer EMB-145H aircraft from an Embraer, Ericsson, and Thales consortium. The aircraft are equipped with Ericsson Erieye AESA radar. These aircraft also have a signals intelligence (SIGINT) capability using Elettronica ALR-733(V)5 electronic support measures (ESM). The Greek aircraft has five workstations and the mission crew typically comprises a radar operator, mission commander, SIGINT specialist, and two weapons controllers. Prior to the delivery of the EMB-145H aircraft, the HAF leased a pair of S 100B Argus AEW&C aircraft from the Swedish Air Force for a two-year period as an interim solution. The EMB-145H aircraft have been operational at Elefsis, west of Athens, since 2009. Using the Link 11 and Link 16 networks, the Embraers can exchange data with airborne, naval, and ground-based assets. A pre-delivery shot of the fourth and final 737 AEW&C for Turkey., BOEING Turkey’s airborne early warning and control fleet is based around the Boeing 737 AEW&C that was acquired under the Peace Eagle program and is sometimes referred to by the local designation E-7T. The aircraft’s primary sensor is the Northrop Grumman Multi-Role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) surveillance radar. The impetus to acquire the aircraft seems to have been to “fill the gaps” in airspace coverage over Turkey’s mountainous territory, where ground-based radars wouldn’t necessarily detect high-speed, low-flying targets. The Boeing 737 AEW&C was selected in 2000 and four examples were eventually ordered, the first provided by Boeing, while the remaining three were outfitted by TAI. The project experienced a number of delays, including as a result of a breakdown in relations between Ankara and Israel, the latter which was to provide the Elta ESM system. The first aircraft was finally delivered to the air force in 2014, six years late. Today, the four aircraft are stationed at Konya and as well as working with fighters and monitoring airspace over the Aegean, the fleet has been used to monitor movements along the Syrian border including reportedly tracking Wing Loong II drones operating over Libya. Unlike the HAF’s EMB-145H, the 737 AEW&C can use inflight refueling to extend the duration of its missions. AEW&C inventory Greece: EMB-145H (4) Turkey: 737 AEW&C (4) Tactical transport and tankers With most combat operations anticipated to take place regionally, the Hellenic Air Force has a fairly modest tactical transport fleet. It also lacks an organic air-to-air refueling capability, meaning fighters would have to be refueled on the ground, perhaps at forward-located island airstrips. The air force operates around seven older C-130B/H Hercules airlifters, plus two more H-models modified for electronic intelligence (ELINT) missions. Surviving Hercules underwent an Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP) between 2005 and 2010, including modifications to the INS/GPS, autopilot, weather radar, and digital engine controls. A partially glass cockpit and revised electronic warfare system were also included. A Hellenic Air Force C-27J Spartan tactical airlifter., HELLENIC AIR FORCE The HAF also flies eight more modern twin-turboprop C-27J Spartan tactical transports, delivered from 2005, although these have experienced limited availability in recent years. Mainly employed for airlift, the Spartans can also be used for medical evacuation and maritime patrol. Three different Turkish Air Force tactical transports on the runway. From front to back: A400M, C-130, and C-160. , TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE In contrast to the HAF, the Turkish Air Force has an aerial refueling capacity using seven KC-135R Stratotankers, which can deliver fuel via their boom or a boom-to-drogue adapter. For its transport needs, the THK relies upon around 16 C-130B/Es (airframes that are even older than those operated by Greece) and a diminishing number of Transall C-160Ds, as well as smaller CN235s , 42 of which were ordered and two of which have been adapted for ELINT duties. The Turkish airlift fleet is also in the process of modernization through the induction of the A400M , and the last of 10 examples are scheduled to be handed over in 2022. Two C-160Ds have been adapted for communications jamming and can reportedly also undertake communications intelligence (COMINT) missions. Tactical transport and tankers inventory Greece: C-27J (8), C-130B/H (9) Turkey: A400M (9), C-130B/E (16), C-160D (13), CN235 (42), KC-135R (7) Maritime patrol Both nations include fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) with anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities and, although these are assigned to their respective naval air arms, there is some crossover as Greece’s P-3 Orion aircraft are operated by Hellenic Air Force flight crews working alongside naval mission crews. The Hellenic Navy ceased operations with its five P-3Bs in September 2009 before a mid-life upgrade and modernization program was launched, Lockheed Martin being awarded a $142-million, seven-year contract covering reactivation of one aircraft plus hardware and software for the other four. The first refurbished P-3B was handed over by HAI in Tanagra in May 2019. Official handover of the first refurbished P-3B to Hellenic Navy officials in May 2019., LOCKHEED MARTIN The aircraft are initially undergoing an interim upgrade, but it’s planned for them to be brought up to full P-3HN standard that should provide another 20 years of service. This also includes an indigenous tactical mission suite, the Maritime Mission Integration and Management System (M2IMS). The Greek Orion fleet is stationed at Elefsis. Once back to full strength, the P-3 will provide Greece with a long-range maritime patrol capability to monitor the Mediterranean, and especially the Aegean, including the Aphrodite gas field off the coast of Cyprus. Turkish MPA capability rests not with its air force but with its naval air arm. After the retirement of the veteran S-2 Tracker in the early 1990s, the Turkish Navy was left without a fixed-wing MPA capability until the launch of the Meltem project at the end of that decade. This has provided six MPA-configured CN235M-100 twin turboprops, acquired under Meltem I, and then outfitted with the Thales AMASCOS-300 (Airborne Maritime Situation and Control System) under Meltem II. For ASW missions, the aircraft can be armed with Mk 46 torpedoes . Finally, the Turkish Meltem III program is now providing a more advanced MPA capability, based on the ATR 72-600 twin-engine turboprop, outfitted by Leonardo. The work has been subject to delays, however, and the first of six aircraft was reportedly still undergoing final tests in April 2020, having made a first post-conversion test flight back in 2014. Maritime patrol inventory Greece: P-3B (1, plus 4 to be refurbished) Turkey: CN235M-100 MPA (6) Combat search and rescue helicopters With significant coastlines and numerous islands to patrol, search and rescue is a critical element of both the Greek and Turkish air arms. As well as a dwindling number of venerable “ Hueys ,” in various versions, the air forces are each equipped with a smaller fleet of helicopters configured for combat search and rescue (CSAR). These would be tasked with retrieving any downed pilots during a conflict, but are also very active during peacetime, during which they provide an important night/all-weather rescue capability. One of the dozen AS332C-1 Super Pumas in service with the Hellenic Air Force., HELLENIC AIR FORCE The HAF CSAR rotary-wing fleet includes a squadron of 12 AS332C-1 Super Pumas home-based at Elefsis, but with regular detachments to operational areas. Of the 12 Super Pumas, four are assigned to duties on behalf of the Hellenic Coastguard . The THK operates around 20 of the more advanced AS532UL Cougar helicopter with detachments based throughout the country. The HAF Super Pumas are also understood to have a special forces support role and this may well extend to the Turkish Cougars, too. It’s worth noting that both militaries have more rotary-wing capacity with similar capabilities spread throughout their army and navy branches. Combat search and rescue helicopters inventory Greece: AS332C-1 (12) Turkey: AS532UL (21) UAVs After the HAF’s retirement of the RF-4E, some reconnaissance taskings have been taken over by a squadron operating the HAI Pegasus II unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), based at Lárisa. Longer-term, the HAF will receive three maritime-configured Heron UAVs leased from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which will provide a much-needed capability boost. According to the Greek Ministry of Defense, these drones will mainly be used for “border defense.” A Turkish Air Force Anka armed UAV., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE The THK already operates the IAI Heron, alongside indigenous drones. The center of its UAV operations is Batman Air Base, which is home to the Heron, and located closer to the Syrian border. Meanwhile, indigenous TAI Anka drones are also found at Incirlik, while a squadron at Malatya is reportedly responsible for the armed UAVs, including examples of the indigenous Bayraktar TB2. How do they stack up? The orders of battle of the Greek and Turkish air arms are fairly well balanced, although Turkey maintains a notable edge in transport and tanker assets, with a total of 36 medium/heavy tactical airlifters and tankers compared with 17 for Greece, which has no aerial refueling tankers. Turkey also enjoys a considerable UAV advantage over its Greek counterpart. The Turkish Air Force has extensive combat experience with drones in Libya and Syria as well as a highly active local industry involved in producing UAVs for different applications . In terms of fighters, the capabilities of the two air arms are nearly on a par, while Greece has 228 fast jets compared with 293 for Turkey. So, Turkey does have a numerical advantage, but that is just one aspect of a force’s ability to project tactical airpower. The availability of refueling tankers could be a critical advantage for the Turkish Air Force. These force-multipliers would provide Turkey’s larger fighter force with even more time on station and longer sustained sortie rates. Combat helicopters — which would play a key CSAR role in times of conflict — also see Turkey edge out Greece in the numbers game, with 21 for the THK compared with 12 for the HAF. Of course, these numbers only represent the total airframes understood to be in the inventory, and do not represent availability, or the numbers of sorties that could be generated in wartime. The other critical factor is pilot training, to which both air forces dedicate considerable resources, maintaining tactics and air warfare centers, plus a dedicated F-16 aggressor unit within the THK. Decades of encounters over the Aegean have sharpened the combat capabilities of the Greek and Turkish air forces and the latest altercations are unlikely to see any major changes in posture, as the air arms continue to maintain their high levels of readiness. Greece and Turkey have been to the brink of war before, but since 1974, the various hostilities have never escalated beyond limited scenarios. A gaggle of Turkish Air Force F-16Cs top-up from a KC-135R air-to-air refueling tanker., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE As we have mentioned, Greek and Turkish fighter jets have repeatedly clashed over the Aegean Sea without actually employing weapons, but the available accounts of those incidents tend to be highly partisan and it’s hard to find evidence of confirmed losses. An exception is the October 1996 encounter in which a Greek Mirage 2000 shot down a Turkish F-16D Block 40 using a Magic 2 air-to-air missile. While the Athens government said the Turkish jet had violated Greek airspace, Ankara claimed it had been on a training mission close to the Turkish mainland. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In another example of previous escalations, a Greek and a Turkish F-16C were apparently involved in a mid-air collision over the southern Aegean in May 2006. Two Hellenic Air Force F-16s had been scrambled to intercept a Turkish RF-4E reconnaissance jet escorted two Turkish F-16s. While the Turkish pilot was rescued by a civilian ship, the Greek pilot was reportedly killed. As well as confronting Greek Vipers, the THK F-16 force has seen action against the Russian Aerospace Forces. An F-16C downed a Su-24M Fencer strike aircraft that had strayed into Turkish airspace during a mission over Syria in November 2015 . During Turkey’s Operation Spring Shield in March 2020, THK F-16s downed two Syrian Arab Air Force Su-24s, reportedly launching AIM-120C AMRAAMs from within Turkish aerospace. A Syrian L-39ZO was also downed during the same campaign. Meanwhile, air-to-ground missions have been flown by THK F-16s against the Kurdish Workers’ Party, a militant group better known by its Kurdish acronym PKK , which is based in the Kurdish regions of Turkey and Iraq. Despite Turkey having much more experience of recent combat operations, there are potential negative factors, too. The attempted coup in Turkey in July 2016 had a significant effect on the air force, and on the F-16 units in particular — the coup-plotters had used F-16s in their efforts to oust President Erdoğan. In the wake of the coup attempt, many F-16 personnel were arrested or removed from their posts and the Viper wing based at Ankara-Akinci was disbanded, the aircraft from its three squadrons (141, 142, and 143 Filos) being distributed to other units. Elements of an S-400 air defense system are unloaded from a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft at Murted Air Base, Turkey, in July 2019., TURKISH MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE The Turkish Air Force may also be hampered by the political fallout from the increasingly strained relations with the United States, and above all on Ankara’s insistence to pursue its S-400 purchase. Turkish officials have voiced concerns that this might lead to a wider arms embargo, which could have negative operational impacts , especially on the air force’s U.S.-supplied fleets. Overall, Turkey’s quantitative edge in fighter airframes, albeit somewhat minor, paired with organic tanker support, would appear to give Turkey an advantage, although that is just in terms of hardware and numbers, and many factors are also at play, as we have discussed earlier. While non-shooting skirmishes over the Aegean Sea are nothing new, it seems that the rhetoric surrounding the current dispute is becoming increasingly belligerent. Turkish Deputy President Fuat Oktay recently said that the Erdoğan government aims to take control of Greek islands close to Turkey. While statements of this kind are clearly engineered primarily for nationalist consumption, they also run the risk of potentially exacerbating an already precarious situation. Larger geopolitical shifts, including major energy reserves being potentially at stake and Turkey’s far more expeditionary minded and assertive military strategy aboard, also point to an elevated possibility that this dispute could take a darker turn. Undoubtedly capable and held at high levels of readiness, the air forces of Greece and Turkey have planned and trained for combat in the Aegean theater for decades. Clearly, a full-scale conflict in the eastern Mediterranean could potentially be very costly for both sides.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 11, 2021",Ship-Launched Version Of The Israeli Harop Suicide Drone Will Be Sailing With An Asian Navy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel Aerospace Industries, or IAI, has secured what appears to be the first sale ever of the maritime version of its Harop loitering munition , or “suicide drone.” The company did not name the customer, but said that they were “the navy of a country in Asia.” Loitering munitions, in general, became a topic of major international discussion after Azerbaijan used Harops to decisive effect in its conflict with Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region last year. IAI announced the deal on Feb. 1, 2021. The same press release said that the company had sold standard ground-launched examples of Harop to “another customer in Asia” and had secured a purchase order for examples of its Rotem rotary-winged loitering munition from a third “foreign country.” Together, the sales were reportedly worth more than $100 million. A standard ground-launched Harop drone., IAI “IAI is a global pioneer in developing the operational concept of a loitering munitions systems, which has ripened to a family of unique and accurate attack systems,” Boaz Levy, IAI’s President and CEO, said in a statement. “These systems, which have added impressive achievements to the operational capability of fighting forces around the globe, constitute central and decisive attack components for advanced battlefields of the future.” IAI has indeed been a pioneer in the development of suicide drones, which are a sort of hybrid between unmanned aircraft and traditional missiles. Harop and Rotem, among a growing field of similar designs on offer around the world, can operate using a man-in-the-loop control system wherein a human operator sees what the drone sees, via a set of electro-optical and/or infrared video cameras, throughout the entire course of its flight. Many of these drones have significant degrees of autonomy and can detect, categorize, and track various types of targets, including ones in motion, automatically. They also typically have modes of operation where they will then proceed to strike those targets without any further need for human input. However, even in this mode, the operator can still choose to abort the strike, even at the very last moment, or make manual adjustments to improve accuracy. This all combines to make suicide drones, in general, very precise while also providing additional means to help avoid collateral damage, capabilities you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone piece . Harop, specifically, find its targets via the aforementioned man-in-the-loop mode. This particular loitering munition emerged in the early 2000s as a successor to the earlier IAI Harpy , which can find certain targets, such as radars, by zeroing in on their emissions. Both Harpy and Harop were initially designed primarily to search for and engage hostile radars in the suppression and destruction of enemy air defense role, or SEAD/DEAD. The two drones are designed to return to the point of launch if they do not find a target, allowing for them to be recovered and reused. Using the man-in-the-loop control system, Harop can engage a much larger array of targets, something that was very clearly demonstrated by Azerbaijani forces during the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh last year, where these loitering munitions were a major factor, something you can read more about in the War Zone ‘s reporting on that conflict at the time. Azerbaijan had been the first country known to have used Harop in anger , employing examples of these loitering munitions for the first time during previous skirmishes over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2016. Azerbaijan’s Border Guard , which is a Harop operator , posted the video below online during the fighting with Armenia last year, which underscores the significance of these drones in that conflict. The Maritime Harop, which IAI unveiled in 2017 , is reportedly very similar to the standard ground-based design, with changes including “a launcher with new marine configuration and adjustments of the communication channel of the loitering munition,” according to a company press release. When employed from a ship, the loitering munitions have the ability to engage targets at sea or on land. It’s not clear what navalized launcher offerings IAI has already developed, but the ground-launched version of Harop are deployed from boxy launch systems holding multiple drones. Concept art the company has released in the past indicates that a derivative of this launcher concept is what it offers for the maritime variant. “In a complex naval theater, the Harop system gives mission commanders in a fleet of ships the capability to independently and organically collect intelligence, assess targets and strike,” IAI said in its press release regarding the new sales. “The intelligence gathered by the Harop is directly integrated in the vessel’s control room and allows for quick, accurate and lethal decision-making.” In a maritime context, Harop could be particularly useful for helping to counter threats posed by various kinds of small watercraft, such as fast anti-ship missile-armed types and even explosive-laden suicide boats , and which may be attacking in relatively large numbers . These loitering munitions could target various kinds of air defense and anti-ship threats close to shore, too. The drones could also just give the crew of a ship improved general situational awareness of what’s going on around them, with the added benefit of being able to immediately prosecute any threats that might suddenly pop up. In addition, while Harops would not be sufficiently powerful to sink a major surface combatant, swarms of them attacking from different vectors could do considerable damage and blind them by knocking out their radars or other sensors. This could result in a mission kill and make the target vessel vulnerable to other types of attacks or take it offline for a prolonged period of time. With all of this in mind, it’s not hard to see how the maritime version of Harop would be a valuable addition to the arsenal of a navy in the Asia-Pacific region. This would be true for a country that has to prepare for potential conflicts across broad areas that include large expanses of water, as well as enemy-controlled islands. While we don’t know who the customer is, Israel has a history of selling various tiers of arms to a number of Asian countries, including various nations in Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam . Countries in that part of the world continue to face the prospect of conflict over China’s expansive and disputed claims to virtually all of the South China Sea . South Korea, which has acquired examples of Harpy in the past, is another possibility. Harop drones could give South Korean naval vessels a valuable tool against various North Korean threats, including small boats that could be used for the clandestine infiltration of intelligence operatives or raiding parties. The country also faces other regional security concerns, including from China, as well as those arising from territorial disputes with Japan. One more potential buyer could be India, which is facing growing maritime challenges from long-time rival Pakistan , as well as from China . The Indian government is long-time purchaser of a wide array of Israeli-made munitions, including ground-launched Harops . We, of course, don’t know for sure who just bought these maritime Harops. This particular suicide drone’s aforementioned performance in last years fighting Nagorno-Karabakh last year has undoubtedly improved IAI’s sales pitch to any prospective customer. What we do know is that Harop is coming to Asia in its maritime form, which will very likely open the doors for new sales of the navalized variant in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2021",British Troops Get Small Swarming Drones They Can Fire From 40mm Grenade Launchers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. British Army troops in Mali are now reportedly using tiny unmanned aircraft that can be fired from standard 40mm grenade launchers . These diminutive quad-copter-type drones can be fitted with various payloads, ranging from full-motion electro-optical video cameras to small high-explosive or armor-piercing warheads, and that can fly together as a swarm after launch. Overt Defense was first to report that members of the U.K. Task Group in Mali had received “several hundred” Drone40s from Australian firm DefendTex. British forces are in Mali as part of the country’s Operation Newcombe, which provides support to Operation Barkhane , a French-led regional counter-terrorism effort, and the United Nation’s Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, also known by its French acronym MINUSMA. A British Army soldier holds a Drone40 during an exercise., Crown Copyright The Drone40, which DefendTex unveiled publicly in 2019 , was among various new systems that British Army troops from the Light Dragoons and Royal Anglian Regiment were seen training with during a Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRX) in October 2020. That MRX was part of the workup for members of those units that headed for Mali in December. It’s not clear if the British Army has decided to acquire Drone40s for widespread use among its units or if it is conducting an operational evaluation through Operation Newcombe. The Drone40 can be fired from launchers designed to fire standard 40mm low-velocity grenades. Its overall length is variable depending on the type of payload installed, but DefendTex says the length of the core body is close to five inches. As such, a launcher designed to fire over-sized 40mm cartridges, such as variants of the Heckler & Koch AG36 under-barrel grenade launcher, which are in service with U.K. and U.S. forces , among others, is necessary to employ them. Some older launchers, most notably the very popular American-made M203 , can only accommodate relatively short 40mm rounds. A British Army soldier holds an L85 assault rifle equipped with a variant of the Heckler & Koch AG36 40mm under-barrel grenade launcher., Crown Copyright The Drone40 can also be deployed by hand, as was demonstrated during the British Army’s MRX in 2020, as seen in the video below. Its design would mean that, regardless of the employment method, troops could carry them in web gear intended to carry standard 40mm grenades. While Drone40s configured with the video camera payload were shown in videos from the MRX, it’s not clear if British troops in Mali have received any other types. DefendTex says that payload can be readily swapped in the field and that when fitted with the cameras, the drones can be recovered and reused. The feed from Drone40s equipped with the cameras is transmitted back to the operator via a line-of-sight link and is on a hand-held tablet-like device. This is also how the drone’s movements are controlled after launch, via a GPS-enabled navigation system. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1pEJHrigWho The camera configuration by itself would be an obvious boon for troops, especially those operating in small units. Drone40s with these payloads offer a way to scout ahead for enemy forces or other hazards, especially in areas full of natural or man-made cover, such as dense urban environments. In addition, though, DefendTex offers high-explosive and anti-armor warhead options, as well as smoke and less-than-lethal flash-bang payloads. There is also an option to fit the drones with small electronic warfare jammers or laser designators to mark targets. The official Drone40 product sheet from DefendTex., DefendTex These other payloads would give units equipped with Drone40s a host of other capabilities. Friendly units safely behind cover could send out armed examples to fly over enemy positions and launch attacks from above. They could also deploy smoke screens to shield their movements or jam enemy communications systems or sensors to confuse or disorient them. Laser pointer-equipped types could paint targets for other units to engage with precision-guided munitions. On top of all this, DefendTex says that Drone40s can operate together as at least semi-autonomous swarms after launch. They also offer was it described as multiple round simultaneous impact (MSRI) capabilities. What this means is that a single individual could fire multiple Drone40s with kinetic payloads and then they could be directed to fly to a designated point, after which they would all drop at the same time. With a mix of different warhead types, this could allow for more effective engagement of complex and dispersed targets all at once, such as troops standing in the open near light armored vehicles. Combined with a camera-equipped type, the Drone40s could act as loitering munitions, hovering over a certain area, waiting for targets to emerge, and then being directed to engage them when they do. DefendTex says that the unmanned aircraft have a range of at least 12 miles and can remain airborne for 30 to 60 minutes, all depending on what type of payloads they’re carrying. Of course, line-of-sight restrictions exist for the command links between the operator and the drones, but it may be possible to use another drone to work as a relay. For British troops in Mali, who are tasked with conducting patrols over broad areas in a region where various militant groups are very active, the benefits of just having small drones to provide additional immediate situational awareness are obvious. If they have received other types of payloads for their Drone40s beyond the camera package, it could provide them with an additional means of engaging enemies in the event of an ambush or any other kind of firefight. For these exact reasons, very small so-called nano-drones are becoming increasingly popular among military forces around the world. Interestingly, the U.K. armed forces had previously employed early versions of the Black Hornet , a tiny hand-launched drone helicopter, in Afghanistan, starting in 2012, before withdrawing them from service in favor of larger individually-launched types sometime between 2016 and 2017. You can read more about the Black Hornet, variants of which are now in service in almost 20 different countries, in this past War Zone piece . https://youtube.com/watch?v=d5TdbMu8xc4 The Drone40 is also not the only drone intended to be launched from a 40mm grenade launcher presently on the market. The U.S. Army evaluated another type , Skyborne Technologies’ Cerberus GL , during its annual Army Expeditionary Warfare Experiment AEWE in 2019. It’s interesting to note that Skyborne Technologies is also based in Australia. Last year, researchers at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) filed a patent on another camera-equipped 40mm drone design, known simply as the Grenade Launched Unmanned Aerial System (GLUAS). That unmanned aircraft can remain aloft for up to 90 minutes, but has a maximum range of just over one mile, indicating that it may be slower than the Drone40 and more limited in range in terms of its command and control interface options. A rendering of the US Army-developed Grenade Launched Unmanned Aerial System (GLUAS) drone., US Army All told, the British Army’s fielding of the Drone40, even in limited numbers with forces in Mali, is another example of how drones and other unmanned capabilities are only becoming more and more ubiquitous, including at the very lowest operational levels, among military forces around the world.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 7, 2021",The B-21 Raider Bomber Combined Test Force Has A Ridiculously Sinister Shakespearean Motto,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-21 Raider , which will really be much more than just a bomber , looms over the Air Force like a giant shadow. By every indication, the public reveal of the aircraft, two of which are under construction now, will be the biggest such moment since its progenitor, the B-2 , was rolled out, 33 years ago . At the same time, the test force that is set to usher it into an operational capacity has been stood up for some time now, along with new facilities to accommodate it at Edwards AFB . While we have seen this task force’s patch before, now we get a glimpse at its challenge coin, which includes an especially sinister motto. The challenge coin images come to us via our friend and accomplished photojournalist Ashley Wallace . He collects rare military patches and challenges coins, and this is one of the most prized in his collection, which you can examine more of over on Instagram. Three years ago we worked to decode the first appearance of the B-21 Combined Test Force patch, which looked identical to the side of the challenge coin with the reaper and the name “PRAENUNTIUS” or “harbinger of things to come” on it, which you can read about in full here . As if that wasn’t ominous enough, the unit that is tasked with bringing the B-21 to life’s challenge coin presents another motto on its flipside that actually pairs directly with the other: “HUC VENIT MALUM.” The B-21, which will have conventional and nuclear roles, will be the most advanced air combat aircraft ever built., USAF/Compisite image We have inquired about this Latin term with multiple people. A number of translations have come from it, but many of them pretty much say a similar thing in different ways. This mainly includes “here comes evil,” but by most indications, including a Latin professor’s, the motto is a reference to a quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth: “something wicked this way comes.” A synopsis from nosweatshakespeare.com reads: With the help of his wife Macbeth murders King Duncan, and from that moment on things change. He does become king but paranoia begins to affect him and he takes extreme measures, including more murders, to cover up his crime and keep his hold on power. He very quickly descends into a state of pure evil, and Shakespeare saturates the text with images of evil, hell, violence, darkness, associated with him. To show the extent of his depravity Shakespeare shows one of his agents murdering a child onstage. The witches, supernatural creatures, are representatives of pure evil, their existence being entirely devoted to destroying human beings. Macbeth is their current big project and they watch his decline. When he can’t stand his guilt and fear anymore he decides to seek the witches out to find out what’s going to happen to him. They know he’s coming, and as he approaches, the second witch tells her sisters: ‘By the pricking of my thumbs/Something wicked this way comes.’ He is now a thing, not a person, and very far from the hero he was at the beginning of the play. He is not just a thing, but something wicked, coming this way. It’s a terrifying image – the kind of thing that terrifies us in horror movies. There is also the Ray Bradbury horror/fantasy novel by the same name with its own evil connotations. Regardless, the Shakespearean-callback plays nicely into the aforementioned harbinger motto, as well, as the Combined Test Force is there to usher in what will be the most capable, sinister, and deadly aircraft the force Air Force has ever fielded . Below the motto on the challenge coin, there is also the logo of the No Fear clothing brand. This has become a popular symbol for having “no fear” in some U.S. military aviation communities, including the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). For instance, the logo was seen on the front of a 160th SOAR MH-6 Little Bird helicopter during a training exercise in 2019. The side of the challenge coin with the motto also mentions Northrop, the 412th Test Wing, and the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center’s (AFOTEC) Detachment 5 (Det 5). The 420th Flight Test Squadron, the designated Combined Test Force unit, which the Air Force activated at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 2019, is assigned to the 412th Test Wing. AFOTEC Detachment 5, also based at Edwards, is responsible for operational test and evaluation of various types of aircraft , including bombers. The appearance of the challenge coin comes as work on the B-21 program continues to progress steadily. As of January, two Raiders were under construction at Northrop Grumman’s portion of Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, according to Randall Walden , head of service’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), which is overseeing the B-21 program. The first aircraft, which Walden had said was “starting to look like an airplane ” back in August 2020, is now due to make its first flight sometime in mid-2022. There had been hope that this event would occur before the end of this year , but there had also already been indications that the timeline would get pushed back . “In the last few months, we did another successful end-to-end demonstration to further mature that hardware and software, and it’s working quite well,” Walden had told Air Force Magazine in an interview that was published last month. “We’re working not only in the flight test activities, but also working with the government test infrastructure to make sure that what we’re doing, from a system integration point of view, makes sense.” The mention of flight activities likely includes surrogate demonstrator aircraft, like the specially outfitted Gulfstream owned by Northrop Grumman that has been highly active over the Pentagon’s secure test ranges, but also potentially some form of classified technology demonstrators or other existing platforms. Walden would not say specifically what issue or issues had been responsible for delaying the first flight, but said they “required some … basic changes to the design, of which we have a good understanding today through ground testing and engine testing.” He added that problems with thrust generation, linked to the aircraft’s complex stealthy engine intakes and their serpentine ducting, something that became public knowledge in 2018 , have been resolved. Walden further explained that the second prototype was being used to further prove out advanced production techniques that will be required to produce the bombers in quantity. “We’re very pleased with the … very high percentages of efficiency … as compared to No. 1,” he said of the construction of the number two aircraft. “The second one is really more about structures, and the overall structural capability,” he added. “We’ll go in and bend it, we’ll test it to its limits, make sure that the design and the manufacturing and the production line make sense.” As noted, the 420th Flight Test Squadron is already waiting at Edwards to begin flight testing prototype B-21s. There has been significant construction at that base ahead of the arrival of these bombers, as well, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces . Beyond that, the service is already laying the groundwork for the first operational squadron, which is set to be activated at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota sometime in the mid-2020s. Additional squadrons are then expected to subsequently stand up at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Mar 9, 2021",B-1 Bombers Are Deploying To Norway For The First Time With An Eye On Nearby Russia And The Arctic,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is preparing to deploy bombers to Norway for the first time. A detachment of B-1Bs , accompanied by more than 200 personnel, is set to arrive at the country’s Ørland Main Air Station in the near future as the U.S. military intensifies its focus on the strategically important Arctic region . U.S. European Command (EUCOM) announced today that an advance team was about to head to Ørland ahead of B-1Bs touching down, but did not say specifically when the bombers would arrive. There are reports that the aircraft could make their way across the Atlantic later this week, while the first airmen have already arrived in the country. The aircraft and airmen assigned to this Bomber Task Force (BTF) will all come from the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. A B-1B from the 28th Bomb Wing accompanied by Royal Norwegian Air force F-35A fighters during a BTF deployment last year., Norwegian Armed Forces “Operational readiness and our ability to support allies and partners and respond with speed are critical to combined success,” Air Force General Jeff Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa, said in a statement. “We value the enduring partnership we have with Norway and look forward to future opportunities to bolster our collective defense.” The BTF is also of note in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to EUCOM, the deployment is “in keeping with force health protection measures aligned with the Department of Defense, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Norwegian policy.” This means all Air Force personnel will be medically screened in Texas prior to arriving in Norway and will undergo a 10-day quarantine. Only last week, the Norwegian government canceled a military exercise after a spike in coronavirus cases, leaving 1,000 U.S. Marines in Norway, where they had arrived earlier this month. U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE) routinely hosts a variety of U.S. aircraft, including BTF deployments. However, bombers have almost exclusively operated out of RAF Fairford in England, which serves as a dedicated bomber forward operating location in Europe, in the past. That being said, there have been efforts to expand the number of operating locations in the region for U.S. bombers in recent years. While Ørland is located just over 300 miles from the Arctic Circle, the deployment signals the Air Force’s increasing commitment to working alongside NATO allies and other partners on Russia’s northwest borders as well as its ability to work in the High North. The Norwegian base is otherwise home to the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s expanding F-35A stealth fighter fleet and also periodically hosts NATO E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft from Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Last July, the Air Force announced a new Arctic Strategy that calls for an increased presence in the region to counter the threat posed by Russia. The wider region has been identified as a potential flashpoint, as climate change sees a scramble to secure the potential wealth offered by natural resources, as well as new maritime trade routes that are no longer constrained by year-round sea ice. “The Arctic is among the most strategically significant regions of the world today — the keystone from which the U.S. Air and Space Forces exercise vigilance,” said Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett. “This Arctic Strategy recognizes the immense geostrategic consequence of the region and its critical role for protecting the homeland and projecting global power.” Six B-52H Stratofortresses in formation in Norwegian airspace on August 22, 2020, while en route to RAF Fairford., 23rd Bomb Squadron/Public Domain Until now, bomber missions over the Arctic have been staged out of RAF Fairford, while on other occasions nonstop missions have been flown from airbases in the United States. The upcoming deployment to Ørland will bring these aircraft much closer to the operating area and send a powerful signal to Moscow. Moreover, there is a significant value in the ability to deploy bombers to different locations from the perspective of distributed operations. Having only one base in the region where bombers are sent regularly is predictable and makes those assets vulnerable. The War Zone has, in the past , also examined the increased risks posed to established bases. Despite that, we still don’t know if U.S. bombers will become a regular feature at Ørland and whether the base has the facilities required to support them for longer periods. Placing bombers in Norway, albeit on a temporary basis, is clearly in line with this new posture. The first BTF in Ørland also continues the U.S. military’s expanding relationship with its Norwegian counterpart, which last summer included high-profile joint maneuvers by six B-52H Stratofortress bombers, flying from RAF Fairford, together with Norwegian F-35As and F-16 fighter jets. Similar missions were flown the previous year , too, again involving B-52s and F-16s. A fully armed Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16 over the Barents Sea region during a Bomber Task Force deployment in November 2019., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Duncan C. Bevan As well as joint exercises in the air and on the ground , in the future, this relationship could potentially also see U.S. Navy submarines operate from a cavernous naval base built under a Norwegian mountain. This would be one initiative to help counter increased Russian submarine activity in the nearby Barents Sea and the Arctic region. Navy submarines are already active in the region anyway, however, and last summer the U.S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing a number of pictures of the first-in-class USS Seawolf surfaced in a fjord near Tromsø, Norway. This very rare public appearance in Scandinavia seems to have been intended, at least in part, to send a message to the Russian government about American underwater capabilities in the region. Among other U.S. military activities directed toward the Arctic, the iteration of Exercise Trident Juncture held in October and November 2018 tested the ability of NATO to defend Norway and was clearly intended to address the resurgent Russian threat. For the first time in more than two decades, the U.S. Navy sent an aircraft carrier, USS Harry S. Truman , into the North Sea to support the exercise. U.S. Marines with 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, advance on an objective defended by opposing Spanish forces during Exercise Trident Juncture in Norway, November 2018., U.S. Marine Corps/Sgt. Averi Coppa The Arctic strategy extends closer to home, too, where the U.S. military is also embarking on a significant overhaul of its assets in Alaska. This includes a huge new Air Force F-35 wing at Eielson Air Force Base, which you can read all about here . For its part, Russia established a new Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command in 2014, which is responsible for the Arctic, North Atlantic, and Scandinavian regions. It includes the Northern Fleet, assets of which are concentrated on the Kola Peninsula, as well as military garrisons, and airbases. Russian military aircraft are now more frequently operating from forward-located airfields in the High North, facilities that you can read more about in this previous article. The particular long-range conventional strike capabilities offered by the B-1 — in the form of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile , or JASSM, and the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM — would lend themselves particularly to any kinds of missions tasked with holding Northern Fleet targets at risk. If a crisis or conflict should break out in the Arctic or North Atlantic region, U.S. airpower would be expected to play an important part. This upcoming B-1 deployment to Norway will not only help train for any such eventuality but hopefully serve to dissuade potential aggression in this increasingly contested part of the world.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 9, 2019",Royal Navy Submarine Appears In Gibraltar Equipped With Enhanced Wake Detection System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Navy’s Trafalgar class attack submarine HMS Talent has arrived in the British territory of Gibraltar sporting curious new sensors on either side of its sail. We can say with near certainty that these are additions to an existing system designed to detect enemy submarines without the use of sonar that first appeared on the boat in 2019. Photographer David Parody grabbed the pictures of Talent in this new configuration as it sailed into Gibraltar today and was kind enough to share them with The War Zone . In addition to the sensor suite, the submarine also has a pair of 7.62mm FN MAG machine guns , known as L7 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG) in British military service, mounted on pintles on top of the sail. The fitting of machine guns in this manner, together with arming individual sailors with small arms and non-lethal weapons , are common force protection measures employed by the crews of Royal Navy submarines, as well as those belonging to other navies, especially when entering or exiting ports. A close up of the new sensor arrays on the sail of HMS Talent , as well as the two L7 machine guns., DM Parody 2021 (https://dotcom.gi/photos) HMS Talent in its latest configuration in Gibraltar., DM Parody 2021 (https://dotcom.gi/photos) It’s not clear how long Talent has had all three of these sensor arrays installed together. The boat is one of just three remaining Royal Navy Trafalgar class submarines, which have been steadily retired as new Astute class attack submarines have entered service. Talent is scheduled to be decommissioned later this year. As for what these sensors actually do, they are designed to detect other submarines beneath the waves via the changes in water density that they leave in their wake. These systems have historically been almost exclusively associated with Soviet and now Russian submarines. In that country, they are most commonly referred to collectively as examples of a System Obnarujenia Kilvaternovo Sleda (SOKS), or Wake Object Detection System. There have also been reports in the past suggesting that certain SOKS variants could be able to detect trace amounts of certain chemicals in a submarine’s wake, including from temporary anti-corrosive coatings flaking off or byproducts from oxygen generation systems. Detecting minute increases in radiation levels from the reactors on nuclear-powered boats, such as the Trafalgar class, or elevated water temperatures from a submarine passing by, may also be among their capabilities. SOKS gear fitted to an early Soviet Akula class submarine., via Popular Mechanics In principle, such a system would be a valuable additional passive sensor for a submarine when hunting for other boats underwater. While modern sonar systems have passive, as well as active functionality, in the former mode, operators have to pick out the sounds of another submarine from a host of background noises, ranging from sea life to the simple movement of the ocean itself. These issues are even more pronounced in shallower littoral areas . You can read more about how all of this works in this previous War Zone story . Using active sonar “pings” could help them find a target faster, but would also greatly expose the boat sending out those signals. In submarine warfare, staying as quiet as possible is critical to staying alive, as you can read about in greater detail in these past War Zone pieces . https://youtube.com/watch?v=_S9wRl9zpw0 At the same time, there have long been debates about just how effective SOKS variants, which appear to have first emerged in the late 1960s, might actually be, with now-declassified U.S. intelligence documents hinting at potential limitations in range and sensitivity. At the same time, the continued Russian use of such systems would indicate that they provide at least some level of additional sensing capability. A screengrab showing the Russian Navy Akula II class submarine Vepr , also known as K-157, with SOKS equipment on its sail., RT capture In addition, there continues to be clear interest among other militaries around the world, including elements of the U.S. military, in sonar alternatives . The year before Talent had appeared in Gibraltar with the addition to its bow, another Trafalgar class submarine had arrived there with a similar-looking modification to the front of its sail. The additional arrays on Talent could enable it to collect more data and do so more rapidly, improving its overall capabilities. Putting the additional sensors on either side of the sail might improve the system’s ability to determine the range or depth of the target based on the differences between what each of the three arrays detect, broadly akin to how radiofrequency signals can be triangulated . A frontal view of HMS Talent in its latest configuration showing the two sensor arrays on the sides of the sail, as well as the one on top of the bow., DM Parody 2021 (https://dotcom.gi/photos) General technological advances, including increased computing power and artificial intelligence-driven systems to help process data from the sensors faster and more accurately, over the years may well have helped make the general concept more viable, as well. Those same developments could also enable the fusing of the wake-detecting data together with information from the boat’s sonar arrays and any other sensor systems onboard to even more precisely spot, categorize, and track hostile submarines, as well as any other objects of interest underwater. Using an older boat, such as Talent , to help prove all of this out in an operational environment would make good sense, too. The Mediterranean Sea, where Gibraltar is situated, which is a relatively well-understood body of water where Russian submarines are known to prowl, could be a particularly ideal testing ground. Another view of Talent with its new sensor fit., DM Parody 2021 (https://dotcom.gi/photos) DM Parody 2021 (https://dotcom.gi/photos) “We’ve put this submarine right in this area of the eastern portion of the Mediterranean to counterbalance the Russian buildup in Syria,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Houston, then-tripled-hatted as Director of Plans and Operations for U.S. Naval Forces Europe/U.S. Sixth Fleet, the Deputy Commander of Sixth Fleet, and the Commander of Submarine Group Eight, told ABC News ‘ “Nightline” in 2019, referring to the deployment of the Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Florida to that area. “We’re watching them [the Russians] very very closely. There’s really not a day where we’re not watching them, every single day.” Concerns about increases in Russian submarine activity, especially on both sides of the northern Atlantic , have grown among NATO members, including the United States and the United Kingdom, in recent years. Expanding Chinese underwater capabilities present another growing naval challenge. Both of these countries are also increasingly fielding new nuclear and advanced conventionally-powered submarines with features that make them extremely quiet and difficult to detect. All of this would only underscore a desire for additional ways to detect threats beneath the waves, such as a wake-detecting system. All told, while Talent may be set to sail into retirement later this year, the equipment fitted to the submarine now may well find its way onto other Royal Navy boats in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first of the U.S. Air Force’s new F-15EX Eagle fighter jets took to the air today. The new fighter, described as the most advanced version of the F-15 ever built, made its maiden flight from St. Louis, Missouri, departing at 1:53 pm local time in a dramatic “ Viking takeoff ,” almost 50 years after the original F-15A prototype was first flown. The War Zone was first to unveil the F-15X initiative and describe its implications back in July of 2018. The fantastic Viking Aero Images (Alex Farwell) has provided us with amazing shots, one seen at the top of this story, of the F-15EX’s “Viking Takeoff” during its first-ever departure, as well as its recovery as the historic test flight mission came to a close. Serial number 20-0001 is the very first aircraft that the service purchased in the previous fiscal cycle and we got our first glimpse of it last summer when the Air Force announced that Boeing had won a contract worth nearly $23 billion to work on the program, which is designed to fulfill an urgent requirement for new-build fighters. F-15EX roars over the runway at Lambert Field before executing a near-vertical climb on its first flight., Viking Aero Images Of the roughly $23 billion covered by the deal announced by the Air Force on July 13, 2020, $1.2 billion is covering the delivery of the first lot of eight aircraft for which Congress approved funding in the Fiscal Year 2020 defense budget. The Air Force has also requested money to buy an additional 12 aircraft in the 2021 Fiscal Year and hopes to purchase a total of 76 F-15EXs over the five-year Future Years Defense Program. Ultimately, the aims to acquire at least 144 of the jets as it sets about replacing its older F-15C/D Eagles that are rapidly running out of airframe hours. That number could grow in the future as the flying force balances its needs for low-observable fighters and advanced 4th generation types. Even the possibility of replacing the F-15E with the F-15EX has been floated unofficially. F-15EX serial 20-0001 screams into the vertical. , Viking Aero Images Last June 30, the Air Force awarded a separate contract to General Electric for an unspecified number of F110-GE-129 engines to power at least some of the initial batch of F-15EXs, citing an “unusual and compelling urgency.” Pratt & Whitney is also expected to submit its F100-PW-229 engine as an alternative under a planned open competition. You can read more about the issues surrounding the selection of the F-15EX’s engines in this recent War Zone piece . “The F-15EX is the most affordable and immediate way to refresh the capacity and update the capabilities provided by our aging F-15C/D fleets,” General Mike Holmes, head of Air Combat Command, said last summer. “The F-15EX is ready to fight as soon as it comes off the line.” With that in mind, the Air Force can expect to get its hands on this new hardware sooner rather than later. General Holmes has talked of airbases currently operating the F-15C/D being able to “transition to the new EX platform in a matter of months versus years.” Boeing, for its part, has said that pilots and mechanics should be able to convert to the new aircraft in “a matter of days as opposed to years.” F-15EX coming in for a landing after a successful first test flight., Viking Aero Images Viking Aero Images Viking Aero Images Before any of the new Eagles arrive on the front line, however, the jet will have to be rigorously tested at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, which will receive the first eight examples, including the first two in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021, which began on January 1, 2021. The remaining six aircraft are scheduled to arrive in the 2023 Fiscal Year. Thereafter, the Air National Guard’s formal F-15C/D training unit, the 173rd Fighter Wing based at Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon, is scheduled to receive the new type, followed by a first operational unit, the 123rd Fighter Squadron, the “Redhawks,” of the 142nd Fighter Wing, based in Portland, Oregon. This is scheduled to occur in 2023, under plans that you can read more about here . Beyond that, the Massachusettes, Louisana, and California based F-15C/Ds could all potentially transition to the new airframe as well, but the F-35A remains another option for these units. F-15C of the 123rd Fighter Squadron, the “Redhawks,” of the 142nd Fighter Wing, based in Portland, Oregon., Tyler Rogoway As to what the F-15EX will bring to the Air Force, compared to the older F-15C/Ds, the main difference is under the skin. The Open Mission Systems (OMS) architecture will allow the rapid insertion of the latest aircraft technologies. The F-15EX will also have fly-by-wire flight controls, a new electronic warfare system, advanced cockpit systems — including the new low-profile HUD that was developed for the F-15QA for Qatar , as well as the latest mission systems and software capabilities available for legacy F-15s. You can read more about the F-15EX and its capabilities in this past War Zone story. Beyond replacing the F-15C/D, the role of which, according to the Air Force is to “gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield,” the new F-15EX promises to offer a range of new, potentially transformative capabilities. These could include serving as a “weapon truck” carrying much larger weapons loads than fifth-generation types, as well as physically bigger munitions, such as large hypersonic weapons now in development but unable to be accommodated inside a fifth-generation fighter weapons bay. As we mentioned earlier, this kind of versatility could yet open the door to the F-15EX eventually replacing the F-15E Strike Eagle, as well as the F-15C/D. This option, which The War Zone has discussed in the past, would not be without controversy, though, since it could further threaten the Air Force’s longstanding plans to procure 1,763 F-35A airframes. It is noteworthy, however, that the F-15EX will be delivered with a lot of equipment in common with the upgraded F-15E, including the Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, the new Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II, and the EPAWSS self-protection system . U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle., U.S. AIR FORCES CENTRAL COMMAND/PUBLIC DOMAIN Outside the United States, Boeing has already offered the F-15EX for export, targeting an Indian Air Force requirement for new fighters , although in that country the aircraft will face competition from multiple other options, not least Boeing’s own F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is also in the running and which could potentially knock out the F-15EX. Whatever path the F-15EX takes once in service with the U.S. Air Force, and potentially with other nations too, the fact that the service will soon start to receive yet another iteration of the venerable Eagle goes to show just how much potential was inherent in that very first F-15A, which took to the skies nearly half a century ago. With the new F-15EXs having a whopping 20,000-hour airframe life, they are likely to serve for well over half a century.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on May 27, 2021",Air Force Says KC-46 Is A “Lemon” That It’s Trying To Make Lemonade Out Of,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has described its bedeviled KC-46A Pegasus tanker as a “lemon,” amid ongoing problems that prevent it from performing its primary aerial refueling mission on a day-to-day basis. Now the Air Force is trying to find other ways to make use of these aircraft, of which it has already received 42 examples located at four operating bases. With deliveries set to continue at a rate of two aircraft per month, the service is now looking to put the Pegasus to work by fast-tracking at least some of the aircraft already delivered into “limited operations,” but probably not involving its core mission set of aerial refueling. Nevertheless, the move could enable the Pegasus to at least provide some utility during real-world operations as the Air Force counts down to the declaration of full operational capability, which won’t happen until late 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. A KC-46A Pegasus arrives at Travis Air Force Base, California, in March 2017., U.S. Air Force/Louis Briscese “As I look over the 10 years, I have to say… right now where we’re at in the program is we’re making lemonade out of lemons,” General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the head of Air Mobility Command, told members of the press, as reported by the Defense One website. The embarrassing setbacks that have become an all-too-familiar aspect of the next-generation tanker program were also highlighted yesterday in an unusually candid tweet from the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), which admitted that problems with the tanker put “America’s ability to effectively execute day-to-day operations and war plans at risk.” A receiver’s view of the KC-46A, including the troublesome Remote Vision System that’s located forward of the centerline refueling housing., USTRANSCOM Amid a catalog of problems that have beset the KC-46, the aircraft’s fundamental ability to transfer fuel to other aircraft has still not been perfected, a full 10 years after Boeing first received an Air Force contract to build 179 of what was then known as the NewGen Tanker to partially replace the service’s roughly 400 Cold War-era KC-135 Stratotankers. So far, 94 of the planned KC-46s have been ordered. The Air Force took delivery of its first KC-46A in January 2019, years behind schedule . In the meantime, the Air Force test community continues to iron out problems with the refueling system and increase the number of receiver aircraft cleared to work with the tanker. To date, the KC-46 has been qualified to refuel 10 aircraft — with some restrictions — and General Van Ovost said that another five new types will be added in the coming months. Among the aircraft that the KC-46 has refueled are the F/A-18 Super Hornets of the U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels , supporting the aerobatic team for the first time during its flyover of the Army-Navy football game at West Point, New York, last December. Other Navy aircraft, too, have been topped up during their own long-range deployments . In these instances, the Pegasus has made use of its centerline hose-and-drogue that has been working effectively. https://youtube.com/watch?v=5NeDith0YuI Authorization for a new “limited operational capability” is now under study, General Van Ovost confirmed, although she did not explain what types of missions this might encompass. In the past, the Air Force has said it would not use these tankers for day-to-day refueling missions, even in many non-combat roles, until the Remote Vision System (RVS) that the KC-46’s boom operators use when linking up with receiving aircraft, is fixed. Work in this critical area is still ongoing. Overall, the RVS is a fundamental part of the KC-46A’s ability to operate as a tanker. Unlike previous Air Force refueling aircraft, where the boom operator was actually situated in the rear of the aircraft and could directly see the relationship between the boom and the receiving aircraft, on the new KC-46A the same personnel sit in the aircraft’s main cabin . General Van Ovost said that work on the RVS isn’t expected to be complete until “late 2023.” Of course, when the RVS fix is finalized, it will still take time to integrate it into all the existing aircraft as well as to train the personnel to use it. All of this will combine to push back the timeline for when the KC-46s will actually be viable tankers for full-spectrum combat operations. The persistent difficulties the KC-46 is having in its ability to master aerial refueling suggest that the formal move to a limited operational capability will still see the Pegasus flying more, but in non-tanking missions. As well as being configured to refuel American, allied, and coalition military aircraft, the KC-46A has always been designed to carry passengers and cargo, as well as patients in an aeromedical role . More recently, the Pegasus has also been tested as a command and control platform hosting the Advanced Battle Management System, or ABMS, which you can read more about here and here . All these mission options have already been flown in at least an evaluation capacity, and could potentially be expanded into more regular operations, too. A 22nd Air Refueling Wing KC-46A refuels a C-17 Globemaster III over the Persian Gulf, November 2019, during the first Pegasus refueling mission in the U.S. Central Command area of operations., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Daniel Snider While using the KC-46 in other roles would be a step forward for the aircraft, it does little to reduce the strain on the Air Force’s other tanker fleets, especially as the service looks to retire its older KC-135Rs and KC-10A Extenders . The first examples of the latter are already being sent to the boneyard. While Van Ovost said she hopes that work to resolve the aforementioned issues with the RVS can be accelerated, other problems are still coming to light, as well. These include two different faults recently identified in the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit, although these seem to have been relatively quickly addressed, at least partially. There is also the fact that it requires more force for the boom on the Pegasus to connect with a receiving aircraft than with previous Air Force tankers and there have been a host of other problems, some of which have been serious enough to be classed as Category I issues: those that would prevent the aircraft from performing one or more primary missions. Items affected by Category I issues have included the cargo locks on the cabin floor in the aircraft, a problem that has now been resolved, as well as a fuel system that leaks excessively . The wing-mounted aerial refueling pods, which will allow the KC-46 to top up three probe-equipped aircraft simultaneously, have also suffered from delays, with Boeing delivering the first nine sets of hose-and-drogue pods almost three years later than originally planned. An aeromedical evacuation technician looks for equipment in an inflight kit during a mission to test the capabilities of the KC-46A during its first aeromedical evacuation, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, July 2020., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Nilsa Garcia Quality control has also been a persistent issue with the KC-46. Last March, a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing revealed that the delivery of a Pegasus to the New Hampshire Air National Guard had been halted due to an electrical issue. Boeing previously also had to suspend deliveries of the tankers on multiple occasions due to the repeated discovery of foreign object debris in completed aircraft. While work continues to address the outstanding shortcomings, the Air Force and Boeing have agreed to proceed with the deliveries of the aircraft, with the Chicago-headquartered planemaker having said it will fix the remaining deficiencies, while the Air Force’s top leadership reserves the right to withhold full payment for the planes — up to $1.5 billion in total if the service docks the company for each of the 52 aircraft in the first batch of planes — until it sees real progress. So far, Boeing has lost more than $5 billion due to delays and shortfalls in the program, which exceeds the value of the initial contract. Declaration of limited operational capability might then come as good news to operators of the KC-46, but the message sent by a tanker that’s not able to perform in its primary role will likely only add weight to the argument for hiring private contractors to provide aerial refueling services to the Air Force. It may also be a cause for concern for the KC-46’s first export customer, Japan, which exercised an option for its third and fourth examples, through the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) process, last October. Japan’s first KC-46 is scheduled for delivery in 2021. Israel, meanwhile, has received U.S. State Department approval for the potential sale of eight KC-46s, as it seeks to select a replacement for its aging Boeing 707-based tankers. The first KC-46A for Japan is rolled out at the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington., Boeing In the meantime, it will be left to the service’s previous-generation tankers to take up the slack. The fact that senior U.S. military officials have warned that retiring veteran KC-135Rs and KC-10As could create a dangerous capability gap shows just critical the tanker mission is, and how far off the KC-46 is from being capable of fully performing its main mission set.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 13, 2020",Navy Looking At America And Ford Class Derivatives In New Light Aircraft Carrier Studies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is once again conducting studies into what it might want out of a potential future class of light aircraft carriers , or CVLs. The service says it has already been looking at designs based on the aviation-focused America class amphibious assault ships and a “light” derivative of the new Ford class supercarriers, among others. Navy Rear Admiral Jason Lloyd offered the update on the Navy’s light carrier initiative during an online talk that the American Society of Naval Engineers put on last week, which USNI News was first to report on . Lloyd is Naval Sea Systems Command’s (NAVSEA) Deputy Commander for Ship Design, Integration and, Engineering, or SEA-05. The Navy resurrected the basic idea of acquiring a CVL of some kind, which has come and gone numerous times over the years, as part of a questionably ambitious overarching force structure plan it unveiled last year. You can read more about that proposal, known as Battle Force 2045, in these previous War Zone pieces . The supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford ., USN “Just because a decision was made 10 years ago does not necessarily mean that decision is the right decision now,” Lloyd said of the decision to once again look into a CVL. “When you’re looking at littoral warfare or you’re looking at great power competition, those are two different adversaries, and the weapons that you need to fight those adversaries might be very different.” It’s not entirely clear when the Navy actively began exploring CVL possibilities again. The service had said it was eying light carriers again in March 2020, only to reveal that it had shelved that effort two months later. Lloyd also said that the Navy had been looking at other designs beyond those based in part on the America and Ford class hullforms. “We’ve looked at various different options and done cost studies on all those options. There are also capabilities studies on all those options,” he explained. Of course, it’s not necessarily surprising that the service has been looking at whether it might able to leverage its two most recent aviation-focused ships in any way in designing a new CVL. Doing so could help reduce the time it takes to finalize a light carrier derivative of either ship and help keep costs low by making use of existing construction processes and supply chains. The amphibious assault ship USS America , at the rear, sails together with the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt ., USN There has already been discussion about using the America class design as a potential starting place for a CVL, including here at The War Zone , and it presents certain immediate benefits for such a conversion. The USS America , along with its sister ship USS Tripoli , are categorized as amphibious assault ships, but lack well-decks traditionally found on such vessels, which are used to launch and recover hovercrafts and other types of landing craft. This has made the design heavily-aviation focused from the outset. The third America class ship, the future USS Bougainville , is the first example of a distinct subclass that will have a well-deck added. The Navy, together with the U.S. Marine Corps, has already been experimenting with the nearly 46,000-ton-displacement America , as well as older Wasp class amphibious assault ships, in the so-called “ Lightning Carrier ” role featuring aviation components with larger than usual numbers of F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . You can read more about this concept in these previous War Zone stories . USS America with 13 F-35Bs on its deck during a deployment in 2019 meant to, in part, explore the “Lightning Carrier” concept., USN At the same time, the Americas , which do not have catapults or arresting gear in their present guise, are still limited carrying to short takeoff and vertical landing fixed-wing aircraft designs, such as the F-35B, as well as helicopters and tiltrotors . They lack an angled deck configuration that would allow for simultaneous launch and recovery of traditional fixed-wing types, which would limit sortie generation capacity. Carey Filling, head of the Surface Ship Design and Systems Engineering Directorate within NAVSEA’s SEA-05 office, who has also been involved in the light carrier studies and was on the same panel as Rear Admiral Lloyd at the American Society of Naval Engineers event, brought up the fact that a conventionally-powered CVL based on the USS America would also not have the range of nuclear-powered supercarriers, such as the Ford . Traditional carriers, compared to boxier amphibious assault ships, typically can reach higher speeds, as well. These seem to be among the reasons why the Navy has also been looking at a “light” version of the 100,000-ton-displacement Ford . “I will say that we certainly learned that it is hard to beat the sortie rate of the Ford . The Ford is optimized for its ability to deliver aircraft and ordnance off the ship at a high rate, so it’s hard to match that,” Filling explained. “I think the other thing to think about is the range of a nuclear carrier, its ability to move somewhere quickly and its speed, is hard to match.” At the same time, Rear Admiral Lloyd acknowledged that more recent developments in aircraft design, especially in the development of unmanned types , including those capable of vertical takeoff and landing , could produce very different assessments of what a future CVL might actually look like. Historically, aircraft carriers, including the Navy’s own new Ford class, have designed around an air wing that is, by far, predominantly equipped with manned aircraft. The fixed-wing components of those air wings have generally utilized designs that take off and land like normal planes. A recent US Navy vision of what a typical carrier air wing will look like in 2030, with manned aircraft still vastly outnumbering unmanned platforms., USN Crafting the air wing for a future CVL around a significantly greater proportion of smaller, unmanned designs, including ones that might not need a large amount of deck space to take off, land, or otherwise move about, would have significant impacts on the rest of the ship. More than a decade ago now, Lockheed Martin presented a concept for a stealthy, unmanned, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, known as the Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Advanced Reconnaissance Insertion Organic Unmanned System, or VARIOUS , which was intended to be optimized for shipboard operations and that could be configured to perform a number of different roles. An artist’s conception of the VARIOUS drone., Lockheed Martin There have been a number of other relatively large vertical takeoff and landing-capable drone concepts that have come and gone since then, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) and XV-24A LightningStrike programs. More recently the Marine Corps was exploring similarly unmanned aircraft, including Bell’s V-247 Vigilant tiltrotor drone, as part of its now-stalled Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System Expeditionary program, or MUX . An artist’s conception of Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) drone., DARPA Concept art showing armed XV-24A LightningStrike drones escorting MV-22 Osprey tiltrotors., DARPA An artist’s conception of a V-247 Vigilant tiltrotor drone firing a Hellfire missile., Bell A future CVL could also be built around advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) that take off and land conventionally. There are already separate discussions about what additional roles the Navy’s future MQ-25A Stingray carrier-based drones might perform as time goes on. These unmanned aircraft will be primarily tasked with aerial refueling, at least to begin with, but the design as it exists now has a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability, as well. Of course, none of this precludes the Navy from investigating more traditional aircraft carrier designs that are just smaller than its existing supercarriers, including the Ford and its future sister ships, as well as the older Nimitz class types . The War Zone has explored in detail in the past how smaller carrier designs could offer significant benefits in operational flexibility, as well as lower operating and maintenance costs, all while providing additional naval aviation capacity. The latter point seems especially important as of late given the significant strains being placed on the service’s existing carrier fleets, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . “An aircraft carrier in World War II is not the same as a Nimitz class carrier; there have been a lot of lessons learned over the years such as being able to do simultaneous launch and recovery, such as being able to safely maneuver aircraft once they’ve landed and still do simultaneous launch. So there’s a lot to an aircraft carrier flight deck that has been lessons learned over the years,” Rear Admiral Lloyd said. “So to go to a CVL light that we talked about has some tradeoffs. We say that it could be significantly less expensive, and it can be, it could be less expensive, but there are tradeoffs to that. So we have to go figure out what it’s going to be.” It’s important to note that there’s also no guarantee that the Navy will ultimately pursue a CVL as a result of these new studies. The service’s overall Battle Force 2045 plan, which has not yet been formally approved, is now in at least a certain amount of bureaucratic limbo due to the change in Administrations from President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden. Biden and his new national security team, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, have already been taking fresh looks at various major defense and security issues that they inherited. At least for the time being, the Navy is continuing to explore a future fleet that could include a new class of light aircraft carriers.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021",The Navy Finally Speaks Up About Its Bizarre “UFO Patent” Experiments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After reporting on the bizarre saga of the Navy’s “UFO” patents by Dr. Salvatore Pais for over a year and a half, The War Zone has finally gotten an on-the-record comment from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, or NAWCAD, about the scientist’s seemingly out-of-this-world work and the service’s equally strange outright support of it. As we reported in our last piece , the science and technology branches of the Naval Aviation Enterprise and NAWCAD took the theories of Dr. Pais seriously enough not just to vouch for them at the highest levels to patent examiners, asserting Chinese advances in similar areas of research and that they were ‘operable’ in nature , but to also subsequently invest a significant amount of money and time into researching the so-called “Pais Effect.” This is a theoretical concept for generating high-intensity electromagnetic fields that could supposedly lead to hypothetical breakthroughs in power generation and advanced propulsion . Specifically, the Navy has now responded to inquiries related to the new documentation we uncovered in our most recent report that shows hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on Pais’s High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG) experiments, along with other details related to it. An overview of Pais’s high-energy electromagnetic field generator concept., DON via FOIA Timothy Boulay, Communications Director at NAWCAD, confirmed several points to The War Zone by email: – The High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator testing occurred from October 2016 through September 2019; – The cost was $508,000 over the course of three years. Around ninety percent of the total – $462,000 – was for salaries, while the rest was used for equipment, test preparation, testing and assessment. – When NAWCAD concluded testing in September 2019, the “Pais Effect” could not be proven. – No further research has been conducted, and the project has not transitioned to any other government or civilian organization. While we greatly appreciate the response to our queries, it remains unclear why NAWCAD was unwilling to speak with us until now if they knew all along these experiments resulted in what appears to be a scientific dead-end that resulted in no verification of any of Pais’s theories. In addition to the statements above, Boulay added the following about the inventor of the Navy’s “UFO patents”: The latest on Dr. Pais: you might remember that he left NAWCAD in June 2019 and moved to the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs organization. I found that he transferred to the U.S. Air Force this month. We are still working with NAWCAD to determine where Pais was transferred within the research organizations of the USAF. Pais’s first move from NAWCAD to Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) office was somewhat interesting given that one of Pais’s most eyebrow-raising patents was for a “ hybrid aerospace-underwater craft .” SSP oversees the development and sustainment of the Navy’s nuclear-armed submarine-launched ballistic missiles . Pais’s hybrid-underwater-aerospace craft concept., USPTO This statement from NAWCAD also raises a few questions about why these experiments were funded and supported so extensively by high-ranking scientists within the organization in the first place. Despite every physicist we have spoken to over the better part of two years asserting that the “Pais Effect” has no scientific basis in reality and the patents related to it were filled with pseudo-scientific jargon, NAWCAD confirmed they were interested enough in the patents to spend more than a half-million dollars over three years developing experiments and equipment to test Pais’ theories. Despite the fact that NAWCAD says the experiments ended in September 2019 without proving the “Pais Effect,” the inventor asserted to The War Zone in a November 18, 2019 email that his work “culminates in the enablement of the Pais Effect” and that “as far as the doubting SMEs [Subject Matter Experts] are concerned, my work shall be proven correct one fine day…” So, as it sits now, the Navy has finally chimed in that its latest little adventure into weird science has ended, at least as far as the seagoing service is concerned. Yet the bizarre secrecy surrounding this entire endeavor that has occurred after the Navy filed the patents publicly remains remarkably odd. Not until we actually got the images, data, and slides about the program of record that attempted to prove Pais’ theories did they chime in to confirm its demise. We may never know why this was the case, although some will claim this was a misadventure in scientific research and fiscal misappropriation, to begin with. This has been a wild ride, and we can’t say for sure if it’s come to an end just yet. But regardless, this is where it sits for the time being.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 26, 2021",Flood Of Chinese Aircraft South Of Taiwan Continues Days After Mock Attack Runs On U.S. Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense says that eight Chinese aircraft, including fighter jets , maritime patrol, and surveillance types, have flown into the southwestern corner of its Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ, in the last two days. There has been a significant uptick in Chinese military aviation activity in this general area of the northern end of the South China Sea in the past two weeks or so. This includes reported mock attack runs on the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , which entered the region, along with elements of its carrier strike group, last week. During the day on Jan. 31, 2021, two People’s Liberation Army (PLA) J-11 fighter jets , Chinese clones of the Russian Su-27 Flanker , along with a pair of domestically-designed J-10s , entered the southwestern end of the ADIZ, according to the Taiwanese Ministry of Defense . A variant of the four-engine turboprop Y-8 configured for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions also flew a separate sortie in the same general region on that day, though the presence of these aircraft in the area is much more common. An F/A-18E Super Hornet comes in to land on the deck of the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , which recently entered the South China Sea., USN Then, overnight, two more J-11s conducted another patrol in this same corner of the ADIZ. Today, Feb. 1, a maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) variant of the Y-8 conducted yet another flight into the area. “Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issues, and air defense missile systems deployed to monitor the activity,” Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense said in each case. Interestingly, it also said that an unspecified U.S. military ISR aircraft, along with two aerial refueling tankers, had also been operating somewhere within the ADIZ on Feb. 1 and another American ISR aircraft had been inside the zone on Jan. 31, all with the apparent consent of the Taiwanese military. The Jan. 31 notice appears to be the first time ever Taiwanese authorities have specifically noted the presence of American military aircraft inside the ADIZ. U.S. and Taiwanese military forces regularly engage with each other , including during training exercises on the island , but do so, generally, in a discreet manner, with few, if any public acknowledgments from either side. There has been a marked shift toward more public discussions about this cooperation in recent years, as former President Donald Trump’s Administration sought to expand the U.S. government’s relationship with authorities in Taipei. The regime in Beijing sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and has repeatedly threatened military action should officials there declare full independence from the mainland. The United States officially has a “one China” policy that does not recognize Taiwan as independent, but reserves the right to engage with officials there separately, as well as support the island’s military, until its final status is formally resolved. This recent flurry of Chinese military aircraft sorties into this particular part of the South China Sea follows a notable uptick in such activity that first became apparent in the latter half of January. As already noted, Y-8 patrols are relatively routine in this general region, which is of great strategic significance. It is where the South China Sea meets the bottom end of the Taiwan Strait , as well as the Philippine Sea and the broader Western Pacific, by way of the Bashi Channel . As a result, it is a major maritime thoroughfare for naval vessels, including Chinese submarines , such as their ballistic missile boats , as well as commercial ships. The airspace above is also regularly transited by military and commercial aircraft. A variant of the Chinese Y-8 configured for anti-submarine warfare and general maritime patrol missions., Taiwan Ministry of Defense However, the PLA has significantly stepped up flights by other combat aircraft, including fighter jets and bombers, in recent weeks. On Jan. 23 and 24, two particularly large armadas of Chinese aircraft had flooded into the region. The grouping on Jan. 23 included 8 H-6Ks and four J-16s, as well as a Y-8 maritime patrol variant. The H-6K is a variant of the H-6 bomber, itself derived from the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger , which is optimized for carrying cruise missiles, including anti-ship types. The J-16s , which also have the ability to carry anti-ship cruise missiles, are Chinese-made derivatives of the Russian Su-30 Flanker fighter jet. A Chinese H-6K carrying an anti-ship cruise missile under its wing., Taiwan Ministry of Defense This was followed by another burst of Chinese military aircraft sorties on Jan. 24, which saw 15 more PLA aircraft fly in the same area. These included six J-10s, four J-16s, and two of China’s Russian-supplied Su-30s, as well as two maritime patrol Y-8s and a single ISR variant of that aircraft. These sorties were directly in response to the USS Theodore Roosevelt , and its associated carrier strike group, sailing through the Bashi Channel into the South China Sea . In addition to simply being a show of force, at least some of the Chinese aircraft reportedly conducted mock attack runs on the carrier, though they also stayed at least 250 nautical miles away from the ship at all times, according to the British newspaper the Financial Times . That story said that individuals familiar with the incident had heard radio chatter of the Chinese pilots going through the procedures involved in releasing anti-ship cruise missiles. The U.S. military did not confirm or deny that these provocative maneuvers had taken place, but did say there was never any actual threat to the American warships. USS Theodore Roosevelt heading toward the South China Sea on Jan. 15, 2021., USN “The PLA activities highlighted here, are the latest in a string of aggressive and destabilizing actions,” Navy Captain Mike Kafka, a spokesperson for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), which oversees all U.S. military activity in the Pacific, also told the Financial Times . “These actions reflect a continued PLA attempt to use its military as a tool to intimidate or coerce those operating in international waters and airspace, to include their neighbors and those with competing territorial claims.” The last year or so has seen other spikes in Chinese military aviation and naval activities, as well as those of the United States and Taiwan , among others , in the same general region, which the War Zone has been following closely . This latest surge came after China held its own large maritime maneuvers in the region, which included the participation of the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s aircraft carrier Shandong , also known as the Type 002, the country’s first domestically produced flattop , as well as its first Type 075 amphibious assault ship . The Chinese government subsequently released video footage from those drills that included a clip of PLAN personnel addressing a notional “enemy” in English, telling them that “You are surrounded. Surrender!” This was seen as a clear signal aimed at the U.S. military. It’s also worth noting that, in addition to being a strategic waterway, this particular part of the South China Sea is also home to Pratas Island, part of the Dongsha Islands chain. Pratas is under Taiwanese control and would be one flashpoint during any future conflict between Taipei and Beijing. Some recent Chinese maritime exercises in the region have reportedly been focused on simulating amphibious operations to seize Pratas. Chinese combat aircraft, including combat jets and bombers, would also be a key part of any larger operation to take control of Taiwan itself. In any such campaign, PLA planes would focus their initial attention on “important command and control centers, early-warning radars , airstrips , and air defense batteries ,” according to a 2017 book, The Chinese Invasion Threat : Taiwan’s Defense and American Strategy in Asia , from Ian Easton, which cited official Chinese military documents the author had obtained. Easton, a China expert at the Project 2049 Institute think tank, said that key government buildings , including Taiwan’s Presidential Office Building, and underground facilities would also be struck and that Taiwanese nuclear power reactors could also be hit to blackout the island. Forces at sea and on the ground, would of course also be involved and the PLA’s largest ground training center, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , has a huge mock urban area with buildings that mimic the Presidential Office Building and other structures in Taipei. Chinese troops conduct a mock assault on a building at the Zhurihe Combined Tactics Training Base that is clearly meant to represent the Presidential Office Building in Taipei during an exercise., Chinese State Media Of course, the South China Sea is, as a whole, hotly disputed, as well, with the regime in Beijing having expansive claims to virtually the entire body of water, something almost all of the countries in the region dispute. The United States and other countries around the world have also rejected the Chinese government’s position, as have numerous international organizations. At the same time, the PLA has steadily worked to increase its presence in the South China Sea, as well as its ability to project power in and around the region. This primarily includes work to expand the size and capabilities of a constellation of man-made island outposts , many of which are now have garrisons of ground-based anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles. This anti-access and area denial posture, which you can read about more in these past War Zone pieces , is bolstered by Chinese aircraft and ships, including those operating from these island bases. Just last year, a picture emerged showing an H-6J, another H-6 cruise missile carrier variant that the People’s Liberation Army Navy operates, on Woody Island , a Chinese island outpost in the northern South China Sea, for the first time. People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) H-6Ks have at least performed touch-and-gos from that island’s airfield in the past, as well. All of this further underscores the Chinese military’s broader efforts to increase its ability to distribute long-range strike capabilities throughout the region. The U.S. Navy’s top intelligence officer recently made dismissive comments about China’s growing anti-ship missile capabilities. This includes the steady development of very-long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles , which the PLA reportedly demonstrated can hit moving ship-sized targets in the South China Sea during an exercise last year “I hope they just keep pouring money into that type of thing,” Navy Vice Admiral Jeffrey Trussler, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, said last week. “That may not be how we win the next war.” At the same time, as the War Zone has stressed , these threats are real, despite any countermeasures and new tactics, techniques, and procedures that the U.S. Navy has available now or in the process of developing. These challenges extend well beyond the South China Sea, too, to other strategic bodies of water around China, many of which are home to their own territorial disputes between the government in Beijing and neighboring states. It’s also important to point out that this latest flurry of Chinese military aviation activity started just days after President Joe Biden’s inauguration . As already noted the previous Trump Administration had very publicly worked to expand the U.S. government’s engagement with Taiwan and had approved a number of very significant arms deals for the Taiwanese military, including the sale of new Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighter jets, which officials in Beijing had previously said was a “red line” issue for them. An F-16A from Taiwan’s Air Force, also known as the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF), flies alongside a Chinese H-6 bomber during an intercept. Taiwan’s F-16A/B fleet is in desperate need of replacement and the country is now set to get new advanced Block 70 F-16C/D jets., ROCAF In the latter stages of his presidency, Trump and his Administration had taken a very hard line against the Chinese government in general, with Washington and Beijing sparring over a host of political and economic issues , not to mention the matter of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , over the past four years. It would not be surprising for Chinese officials to seek to put pressure on the new Biden Administration through all available means, including military shows of force in contested areas, such as the South China Sea. For its part, the Biden Administration appears to be set to take a relatively similar stance toward the Chinese government, at least in the near term. The U.S. State Department has said that Biden’s Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is interested in expanding U.S. cooperation with friendly nations in the Pacific through a grouping known as The Quad that also includes India, Australia, and Japan. An expanded bloc could provide an important additional tool for containing Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, and beyond, as well as a more united front to challenge China’s positions on the South China Sea and similar disputes. The PLA’s recent aerial activity in the northern end of the South China Sea makes clear that the Chinese government is equally keen to show its resolve to continue challenging the ability of the U.S. military, as well as that of Taiwan, along with other American allies and partners in the region, to operate unfettered in the Western Pacific.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Su-24 Fencer combat jet flew low over the destroyer USS Donald Cook , while missile-toting Su-30SM Flanker multirole fighters and mobile coastal defense missile systems undertook high-profile drills, in the latest series of encounters between the U.S. Navy and the Russian military in the Black Sea. All this comes amid what is reportedly the largest U.S. Navy deployment to the region in years, involving two Arleigh Burke class destroyers — the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) and the USS Porter (DDG-78) — as well as a replenishment tanker to support them. The incident involving the Su-24 and the USS Donald Cook took place in international waters yesterday, January 31, 2021, according to the U.S. Navy, whose 6th Fleet posted a video on Twitter. A Russian Navy Su-24M Fencer strike aircraft takes off from an airbase in Crimea., Russian Ministry of Defense It was not immediately clear whether the Su-24 that overflew the USS Donald Cook was a Su-24M strike aircraft — which can be armed with anti-ship missiles and other guided munitions — or an unarmed Su-24MR reconnaissance variant, which are regularly used to keep tabs on other countries’ naval assets in the Black Sea and elsewhere . The latest incident is not the first time that Russian aircraft have buzzed an American destroyer in the Black Sea in recent years. For example, the same thing happened to the USS Ross in May 2015. On that occasion , Russian media said the warship was forced to leave Russian waters, while the U.S. Navy published a video of the encounter, which again involved a low pass by a Russian Navy Su-24. In the intervening years since the USS Ross incident, USS Donald Cook has also been on the receiving end of a low-level fly-by performed by a Russian Su-24. In 2016 the destroyer was in the Baltic Sea when Russian Fencers made multiple simulated attack runs on the ship, flying maneuvers described as “extremely aggressive.” The U.S. Navy has so far issued no formal public complaint about the latest low-level fly-by, although the behavior of Russian military aircraft in the region has been criticized in the past. Last August, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet performed a potentially dangerous maneuver in front of a U.S. Air Force B-52H bomber flying over the Black Sea. Earlier last year, the U.S. accused Russian fighters of multiple unsafe intercepts of a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft over the eastern Mediterranean. For its part, Moscow has also lodged complaints about U.S. military activity close to its borders. The “buzzing” of the USS Donald Cook came a day after a rumored simulated attack on the destroyer USS Porter by no fewer than six Russian jets, although this has not been confirmed by either the U.S. Navy or Russia. On this occasion, it is alleged that Su-24Ms, together with Su-30SM Flanker and Su-34 Fullback strike aircraft, plus Su-27 Flanker escort fighters, took part in complex maneuvers over the Black Sea, flying from bases in Crimea and in southern Russia. Meanwhile, on January 27, the Russian Ministry of Defense posted a video showing Russian Navy Su-30SMs, Su-24Ms, and Su-24MRs taking part in maneuvers over the Black Sea. The defense ministry said the exercise scenario involved “detecting and disabling a simulated enemy warship carrying a sabotage team on board.” Unusually, some of the Su-30SMs participating were armed with Kh-31 air-to-surface missiles, known to NATO as AS-17 Krypton, which are available in anti-ship and anti-radiation versions, but which are rarely observed in frontline Russian service. The anti-ship Kh-31A version has a maximum range of 31 miles and its ramjet powerplant accelerates it to a speed of Mach 3.5 at high altitude or Mach 1.8 at sea level. This weapon’s impressive performance has seen it being used in the past by the U.S. Navy, which acquired a version as a high-speed target, a saga you can read more about here . Interesting stills from today's ""Sluzhu Rossii"" episode: Two #BlackSea Fleet Naval Aviation Su-30SMs (Blue ""41""&""47"") from 43rd Independent Naval Attack Aviation Regiment (Saki) with 2 Kh-31 AShMs each. Footage of Kh-31 in frontline service is quite rare. https://t.co/hS21XSTZW6 pic.twitter.com/FZZx7x9ejB — Guy Plopsky (@GuyPlopsky) January 31, 2021 The Russian Ministry of Defense video ended with footage of one of the Black Sea Fleet’s 3K60 Bal coastal defense missile batteries forward-deployed somewhere in Crimea. Designated SSC-6 Sennight by NATO, the Bal is a subsonic missile, broadly similar to the American Harpoon, and has a range of 75 miles. Each Bal launch vehicle can carry eight missiles, and a pair of launch vehicles can deliver a 16-missile volley against their target. A Black Sea Fleet Bal coastal defense missile system on the move in Crimea., Russian Ministry of Defense It seems very probable that the video of the exercise was intended to reinforce the fact that the presence of the Black Sea Fleet ensures that the region is home to one of the largest concentrations of anti-ship missile capabilities in the world. Should they be called upon, air-launched, surface-launched, and coastal defense missiles could transform nearly the whole of the confined Black Sea into a super anti-ship missile engagement zone at short notice. In fact, this kind of threat was explicitly referred to by the U.S. Navy in a release about the entry of the USS Porter into the Black Sea, which described the “ultimate goal” of these latest operations being “to refine joint air defense procedures to better defend U.S. Navy ships.” The latest U.S. Navy maneuvers in the Black Sea commenced on January 23, when the USS Donald Cook began its northbound transit from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea, before being joined by the USS Porter that entered the Black Sea on January 28. This is, according to the Breaking Defense website, the largest U.S. Navy presence in the Black Sea in three years. Notable in light of the potential missile threat is the fact that both the destroyers have been equipped with RAM point-defense systems , primarily intended for use against anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as their Phalanx CIWS , for operations in very high-threat areas. The USS Porter transits to the Black Sea on January 28, 2021. Porter, forward-deployed to Rota, Spain, is on its ninth patrol in the U.S. Sixth Fleet area of operations. , U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Damon Grosvenor USS Donald Cook had previously entered the Black Sea on November 23, 2020, when it was escorted by the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

Kaiser class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Laramie (T-AO 203), which conducted an underway replenishment (UNREP) with the Donald Cook on January 29. This is a vital capability that ensures warships can remain on station for extended periods without having to go into port, an aspect that is all the more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Taking fuel at sea is the most concrete way for us to sustain independent operations,” said Commander Matt Curnen, commanding officer of Donald Cook . “While the execution of this underway replenishment was business as usual for the crew, the greater implications for U. S. Navy operations in the Black Sea were anything but usual. It’s a new operational model in a new year.” The Henry J. Kaiser class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Laramie , right, and the destroyer USS Donald Cook , execute an underway replenishment in the Black Sea, January 29., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Will Hardy According to the U.S. Navy, the three vessels are “conducting multi-domain operations,” with other assets available in the region including a U.S. Navy P-8A from Patrol Squadron 46 (VP-46) based at Sigonella, Italy, and a NATO E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) flying from Geilenkirchen Air Base, Germany. One of the stated aims of the U.S. Navy’s current Black Sea activities is to “strengthen interoperability” with Georgia and Ukraine, in addition to NATO partners on the Black Sea. Of course, both Georgia and Ukraine both have tense relations with Russia and routinely conduct military exercises with their American counterparts. These kinds of maneuvers have only increased in scale and regularity since the Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, followed by Russia’s support of separatists in Ukraine’s eastern provinces. Among the most high-profile of these exercises is the Sea Breeze series , conducted with the Ukrainian Navy, and which normally sees a spike in U.S. Navy assets deployed in the region. A much smaller joint U.S. Navy and Ukrainian Navy exercise also took place on January 30 and involved the USS Porter and USNS Laramie together with three Ukrainian Navy vessels: the Gurza-M class armored gunboats Kostopol and Nikopol , and the Island class patrol boat Starobilsk . A Ukrainian Navy Mi-14 Haze helicopter also took part. A Ukrainian Navy Mi-14 Haze helicopter on maneuvers with the USS Porter and the USNS Laramie in the Black Sea, January 30. , U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Damon Grosvenor In a statement , the U.S. Navy provided more details about the specific exercise scenario: The exercises provided the U.S. and Ukrainian Naval Forces the opportunity to practice tactical maneuvering while operating with a High-Value Unit, the USNS Laramie . The ships were able to practice coordinated small boat attack responses and surface warfare exercises while watch-standers onboard Porter received small-caliber arms training. The U.S. Navy said that it “routinely operates in the Black Sea to reassure NATO allies and partners and ensure security and stability in the region.” These operations are governed by the 1936 Montreux convention that limits the number of foreign naval vessels that can enter the Black Sea via the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits and dictates how long these vessels can remain there. Under the convention , countries without a Black Sea border cannot keep vessels there for more than 21 days at a time, or even sail warships above a certain tonnage in or out at all. “The Black Sea is a critical waterway for maritime commerce and stability in Europe and combined operations in the Black Sea will strengthen interoperability between NATO partners and allies, including Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Romania,” the U.S. Navy added. However, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko described the ongoing maneuvers as “a disruption of regional security,” in a quote provided to the state-run TASS news agency. Russia’s TASS news agency confirmed that the USS Donald Cook was being tracked by the Russian Navy’s Black Sea Fleet, citing Russia’s National Defense Control Center. “The Russian Foreign Ministry has reiterated that the military presence of warships belonging to the states not bordering the Black Sea could not help facilitate stability in the region,” the agency reported. “NATO’s decision to increase the number of stationing days of their military ship groups, the attempt to undermine the regime established by the Montreux convention… All this increases the potential for hostilities in the region,” Deputy Foreign Minister Grushko told TASS . For the Kremlin, the wider strategic implications of the Black Sea region are something that The War Zone has discussed in the past . However, since Moscow forcefully annexed Crimea, the Black Sea has become ever more important. For example, the Su-30SMs and Su-24Ms seen in the aforementioned Russian Ministry of Defense video are based at Saki in Crimea, which hosts the 43rd Independent Naval Attack Aviation Regiment that has single squadrons of each type. Russia, of course, is keenly aware that three of the countries bordering the Black Sea are NATO members — Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey — all of which were explicitly referenced in the U.S. Navy’s statement about the USS Donald Cook incident on January 31. The enhanced presence in the Black Sea also signals U.S. intent in the region and continues the kind of approach pursued under the previous Trump administration. Last year, for example, U.S. Air Force B-1B Bones bombers flew to and from the Black Sea region to practices procedures for employing the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile , or LRASM, during a training mission the implications of which you can read more about here . Last September, meanwhile, B-52s operating from the United Kingdom flew into Ukrainian airspace in what was another clear signal to Moscow. The two B-1B bombers involved in the May 29, 2020, Bomber Task Force Mission fly over the Black Sea region flanked by a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker, in the foreground, and a MiG-29 Fulcrum, in the background., UKRAINIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENS E This continuation of policy was also demonstrated by President Biden during a recent high-profile phone call with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, when the U.S. leader “reaffirmed the United States’ firm support for Ukraine’s sovereignty,” according to a White House summary . Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Russian aggression in Ukraine was among the key points that Biden wanted to discuss with the Russian leader. Overall, the U.S. Navy deployment in the region makes clear that the new Biden administration has an eye on Moscow’s activities in the Black Sea — and beyond — and that these aims are in line with those of NATO. As the USS Porter entered the Black Sea, NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said that it was “strengthening support for Georgia and Ukraine, including with coast guard training and the sharing of information.” “In response to Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its ongoing military build-up in the Black Sea, the Alliance has increased its defensive presence in the region and remains strongly committed to Black Sea security,” Lungescu added. The NATO presence in the region also includes six Spanish Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets stationed for the first time at Mihail Kogălniceanu airbase on Romania’s Black Sea coast. These are flying patrols alongside the Romanian Air Force and will monitor Russian military aircraft operating over the Black Sea. With high stakes on both sides, it wouldn’t be at all surprising if the current U.S. Navy operations in the Black Sea continue to trigger shows of force from the Russian military in the weeks to come.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 23, 2021","Boeing Can Now Offer The F-15EX To India, But Does Buying It Really Make Sense?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has been given the green light to formally offer its F-15EX fighter jet to India. While that country is seeking to revamp its air arm following various abortive or stalled efforts that have so far failed to truly address the Indian Air Force’s fighter shortfall, but that’s not to say that the mighty Eagle is necessarily the right fit. While Boeing had previously eyed India as a potential F-15 customer, as The War Zone discussed last summer , the marketing license approval from the U.S. government does now mean that a potential sale has become a much more realistic proposition. Ankur Kanaglekar, the India Fighters Lead at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, revealed the company had received the marketing license and said that there had already been talks with the Indian government about the F-15EX while speaking with reporters today. Kanaglekar’s remarks come ahead of the biennial Aero India tradeshow, which opens next week at the Indian Air Force’s Yelahanka Air Force Station outside of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru. Boeing concept art showing the F-15EX in U.S. Air Force service., Boeing “Now that we have the marketing license it allows us to talk to the Indian Air Force directly about the capability of the fighter,” Kanaglekar said, according to Reuters . The Boeing executive added that the company expects further discussions about the F-15EX with Indian officials to take place during the course of Aero India. Described by Boeing as the most advanced version of the F-15 ever built, the F-15EX was tailored for the U.S. Air Force, as a variant of the F-15 Advanced Eagle family, which you can read about in more detail in these past War Zone pieces . The service ultimately plans to buy at least 144 of these aircraft, primarily to replace existing aging F-15C/D Eagles . As the latest iteration of the Advanced Eagle family, the F-15EX is also being increasingly promoted as an export product too, with Boeing concentrating on new potential deals with Israel, which has placed a request for information for up to 25 new Advanced F-15s , and which is eyeing upgrades for 25 of its existing F-15I aircraft , and India, where there is an outstanding requirement for 114 new fighter jets. It’s here that Boeing has identified a possible sales opportunity for its F-15EX variant, pitching its top-of-the-line fighter to what would be an entirely new Eagle customer. Currently, there is a great diversity of aircraft in the running for a future Indian fighter order. Above all, this reflects the different, sometimes confusing paths that this procurement has taken, evolving from the collapsed Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) competition for 126 aircraft, via a plan to purchase single-engine fighter jets that was then opened up to include twin-engine designs . Amid all this, India’s plan to co-produce new-generation Su-57 stealthy fighter jets with Russia under the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft program, or FGFA, dramatically fell through , amid well-publicized Indian concerns about the viability of that project. In April 2018 it was reported that the Indian Air Force had put the FGFA program on indefinite hold, scuppering the chances of it fielding an Indian-optimized Su-57 derivative., RUSSIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT Amid all this disruption, the IAF has long been seeking a new fighter to both modernize its existing fleet, which is still dominated by older Russian-designed jets, and to expand its overall size in an effort to keep pace not only with the Pakistan Air Force, with which the IAF clashed in early 2019 , but also China’s rapidly expanding and increasingly advanced air force. New Delhi has, of course, already purchased a new-generation fighter in the shape of the Dassault Rafale, 36 of which are currently being delivered . The Rafale total, however, falls well short of the kinds of numbers of fighters the IAF would ideally like to acquire and the current Rafale procurement is seen as an interim solution. As well as the F-15EX, other potential candidates in a relatively open field could include more Rafales, or even Boeing’s own F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , in a land-based role. The Eurofighter Typhoon , which previously lost out to the Rafale in the Indian MMRCA competition, could also return, as could the Russian-made MiG-35 Fulcrum and Su-35 Flanker , both of which are much-modernized derivatives of aircraft that are already in IAF service, the MiG-29 , and Su-30MKI . Additional contenders include single-engine types such as the Lockheed Martin F-16, which the manufacturer has also offered in an Indian-specific F-21 configuration , or the Saab Gripen . Lockheed Martin rebranded its latest advanced F-16 offering for India as the F-21., Lockheed Martin Outside of the IAF fighter equation, Boeing has been very active elsewhere in India. As well as offering the F-15EX, the company has continued work demonstrating its F/A-18E/F from a ground-based “ski jump” ramp , as it pitches this jet to meet an Indian Navy requirement for a new carrier-based multi-role fighter . Having Air Force and Navy units flying the same aircraft, or similar variants with a high commonality between airframe components and mission systems, could help reduce fleet management issues, as well as logistical and other sustainment costs substantially. Boeing already has recorded significant previous success selling its products to the Indian military, including P-8I maritime patrol aircraft for the Indian Navy, as well as AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) heavy-lift helicopters for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The AH-64E is also being built in India by Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited, with the first examples for the Indian Army to be completed this year. Aside from Boeing’s success elsewhere in the Indian market, and with so many different fighters in the mix, observers might well ask whether the F-15EX is the right choice for India. The capabilities of the Advanced Eagle are without question, and The War Zone has explored them in depth in previous articles here and here . On the other hand, the F-15EX is also an expensive option when it comes to buying in bulk, which is a key consideration as the IAF seeks to boost its number of frontline fighter squadrons to 42. That number itself is arguably increasingly arbitrary since it speaks to quantity rather than quality. “The government decided on 42 squadrons of contemporary fighters in the 1980s,” Angad Singh, a long-time Indian defense observer told The War Zone . “Pakistan and China have only marched ahead since then, and the IAF’s force structure is anything but contemporary. We’re not spending enough to sustain the current mix of 30 squadrons, and in the future, we are surely going to need over 42.” An Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison loaded with R-73 and R-77 missiles. As well as expanding the overall fighter fleet, aging types like the Bison need replacement. , AEROPRINTS/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS The 114-aircraft Indian requirement has an estimated program cost of around $15 billion, which compares starkly to the approximately $12 billion that was the reported value of Qatar’s contract to buy just 36 F-15QAs, via the U.S. military’s Foreign Military Sales program, in 2017, although this included significant quantities of ancillary equipment and weapons. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force is projected to purchase a minimum of 144 F-15EX jets and an associated indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract has a ceiling of $22.89 billion to cover a maximum of 200 new Eagles. Of course, the final cost of an Indian F-15EX deal would depend not only on aircraft numbers but associated equipment and support services and would also need to factor in potential offsets for local industry, depending on its level of involvement. One of the first new Boeing F-15EX jets under construction for the U.S. Air Force. , U.S. Air Force Speaking to The War Zone last summer, Prat Kumar, Boeing’s Vice President and Program Manager for the F-15 also seemed to express doubts that the jet was exactly right for India, remarking that he was not sure if it was “in the sweet spot” for the requirement. Perhaps, Boeing felt that its F/A-18E/F was a more likely solution for the IAF, especially if the same type were to be selected by the Indian Navy too. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Boeing will drop one of either the Super Hornet or the F-15EX as the Indian requirement develops. Above all, the F-15EX for India might just be the right aircraft at the wrong time. Indian defense spending is currently in the doldrums, with the big-ticket programs more often than not the most at threat. “Big import programs are always first on the chopping block,” Angad Singh told The War Zone . “As much as the IAF would like a contemporary western aircraft to be produced in India, the government is instead likely to prioritize top-up purchases of existing types and more examples of the indigenous Tejas lightweight fighter.” A pair of Tejas Light Combat Aircraft in formation. Progress on signing off on orders for the Tejas has been slow and there remain question marks over its capabilities and growth potential., Indian Air Force Aside from the high-profile, stopgap Rafale buy, new equipment for the IAF has comprised piecemeal purchases of second-hand MiG-29s and attrition-replacement Su-30MKIs from Russia, while the focus instead moves to efforts to secure orders for the Tejas, a program that has suffered more than its fair share of delays and other setbacks. Then there is the question of the Indian government’s requirements for technology transfer and industrial cooperation. This has been a stumbling block in the past and was at the root of the failure of the MMRCA program in 2015. For India, any future fighter purchase will also have to demonstrate that it contributes to the domestic defense-industrial capacity. Here, too, even apparently attractive offerings, such as Lockheed Martin’s arrangement with Indian industrial consortium Tata, which promised to set up an Indian F-16 production line and allow it to build additional aircraft for export, but which, so far, has not been enough to secure any orders. Officials from Lockheed Martin and Tata Advanced Systems Limited sign an agreement affirming their intent to co-produce the F-16 Block 70 in India, in 2017., Lockheed Martin Another potential hurdle to an Indian F-15EX purchase is a doctrinal one. While the IAF has previously settled on the heavyweight Su-30MKI as the backbone of its fighter fleet, its experience with the big Russian jet has not been an entirely happy one. While there have been technical issues and other problems with the Flanker, the IAF has traditionally operated smaller fighters, which have generally proven easier to maintain as well as better able to operate from more austere airbases with a reduced requirement for supporting infrastructure. This, too, may count against the F-15. US Air Force F-15 pilots prepare to fly sorties with the Indian Air Force at Gwalior Air Force Station, India, during a Cope India exercise in 2004., National Archives In the meantime, the lack of clarity in terms of what the IAF wants and what the Indian government can afford is not going to help solve an urgent need for more fighters. After all, as long ago as 2001 , when there were still 39.5 IAF fighter squadrons, the service had identified a requirement for 126 modern fighters but aspirations to buy this number perished with the demise of the MMRCA effort and there has been little concrete progress since then. In the intervening years, the current IAF fighter inventory has only gotten older, and squadron numbers have diminished as various types have been retired wholesale . New Delhi needs to find a solution sooner rather than later but, in this case, at least, the F-15EX might not be the answer.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 19, 2020",The Navy Has Begun To Hunt For Its MH-60 Seahawk Helicopter And Fire Scout Drone Replacements,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it’s starting to work out how to replace its existing fleet of MH-60R/S Seahawk helicopters and MQ-8B/C Fire Scout rotary-wing drones. The effort is part of the larger Future Vertical Lift program, a U.S. Army-led initiative that aims to acquire replacements for that service’s various helicopter fleets, as well as others across the U.S. military, that are set to start entering service in the 2030s. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) posted a request for information (RFI) for an Analysis of Alternatives for what it is calling the Future Vertical Lift-Maritime Strike (FVL-MS) program on the U.S. government’s beta.SAM.gov contracting website. At this early stage, the Navy is emphasizing that it is looking for formal proposals from industry, but information that is needed “to support efforts to identify cost-effective alternatives to fill capability gaps in the MH-60R/S and MQ-8C as they begin to reach their end of service in the 2030s.” These new aircraft are expected to reach initial operating capability in the mid-2030s. An MQ-8B and an MH-60R share the flight deck of a U.S. Navy warship., USN While the Navy document is clear that successors for the MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters are covered under FVL-MS, it is less clear which variants of the Fire Scout unmanned aerial vehicle the service is looking to replace at the same time. At different points, the RFI refers to the MQ-8B/C, just the MQ-8C, and also the generic MQ-8 designation. Which one is most accurate could make a significant difference, since the MQ-8B is a completely different design from the larger, more capable MQ-8C , the latter of which is derived from the commercial Bell 407 airframe and entered service much more recently. Regardless, since the MH-60R/S and MQ-8B/C fleets represent the vast majority of the Navy’s current rotary-wing fleet, manned and unmanned, anything that replaces them will need to be able to perform a wide array of mission sets. The Navy lists the missions required of the future FVL-MS platform, in no particular order, as follows: Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISR&T) Surface Warfare (SUW) Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Mine Counter Measures (MCM) Air Warfare (AW) Electronic Warfare (EW) Search and Rescue (SAR) Command and Control SOF Support An MH-60R fires a Hellfire missile during a training sortie. , U.S. Navy In addition, the Navy provides certain other functional requirements that will be studied in the various responses. These are: Embark Aviation and Air Capable Ships Conduct Logistics Conduct Patient Movement Signature Control The last of these categories, “Signature Control,” refers to efforts to reduce the aircraft’s radar, infrared, acoustic, and other signatures for operations in more contested airspace. An MQ-8C at Naval Base Ventura County at Point Mugu, California., U.S. Navy Once the Navy receives responses to the RFI, it will examine the alternatives for their contributions across this full range of mission areas. The service will also assess how the proposed solutions will meet the challenges posed by the increasingly sophisticated adversaries that they are likely to encounter. Without a doubt, it will be a challenge to meet these diverse mission profiles with a single airframe, with the Navy’s contracting notice itself remarking that the “warfighting capability provided, whether deployed as Carrier Air Wing squadrons embarked on aircraft carriers under the leadership of carrier air wing commanders or as expeditionary squadrons embarked on LHAs / LHDs , surface combatants and logistics vessels, is broad and unparalleled in naval warfare.” At the same time, there is no specific wording in the RFI, responses to which are due no later than April 13 of this year, that says the Navy intends to acquire a single type to meet all of its demands. The overarching FVL program has already produced diverse sets of requirements with the aim of replacing various other helicopters. Headed up by the Army, the effort has so far yielded the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program, which should provide a high-speed, long-range replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk series of helicopters, and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), a project that is looking to fill the gap left by the early retirement of the service’s OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopters. The winner of the FARA competition is set to eventually supplant the nearly half of the service’s AH-64 Apaches that presently serve in the armed reconnaissance role. Variants of either of the two candidates for the FLRAA program, the Bell V-280 Valor advanced tilt-rotor and the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Defiant X advanced compound helicopter, could potentially meet some of the Navy’s FVL-MS requirements. As possible UH-60 replacements, these designs could well be adapted to serve as successors to the Navy’s MH-60R/Ss. Bell V-280 Valor., Jay Miller The latest concept for the proposed Defiant X., Boeing-Lockheed Martin Bell, for its part, has already provided an idea of what a navalized V-280 could look like, with an artist’s impression, seen below, of the tilt-rotor operating from a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship. This was meant to portray a Marine Corps-specific FLRAA variant that is able to operate from ships in maritime environments and that could perform troop and cargo-carrying missions, as well as to conduct airstrikes and other armed operations. This immediately aligns with a number of the FVL-MS mission sets. Bell That same artwork also features Bell’s V-247 Vigilant, an unmanned tilt-rotor design the company had proposed for U.S. Marine Corps’ now-stalled MUX project. The V-247 has a modular design that could make it appealing to the Navy, as well. The Vigilant, which you can read more about here , could be one potential replacement for the MQ-8B/C under the FVL-MS program. Bell showed a full-size model of its V-247 Vigilant to the public for the first time at the Modern Day Marine Expo at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia in 2018. , Bell That being said, despite the superficial similarities in replacing the MH-60R/S and the Army’s UH-60 series, it is worth remembering that the FVL program had previously separated replacements for these helicopters into different categories. As originally laid out, the Navy’s current FVL-MS program fell under the FVL’s Capability Set 2 bracket, which envisaged an aircraft smaller than Capability Set 3. Capability Set 3 has since evolved into the FLRAA program and the Capability Set terminology has since fallen out of use entirely in discussions about FVL. All of this may have, at least in part, reflected the fact that a successor for the Army Black Hawks might easily end up being too large to be readily adapted to operate from all the types of ships expected of the Navy aircraft. In addition, while the requirement to replace the MH-60R/S could still lead to an airframe that’s essentially a maritime version of the Army’s eventual FLRAA design, the need to supersede the MQ-8 drone suggests a different mission profile altogether. The fact the Fire Scout is unmanned would seem to demand the FVL-MS be an optionally-manned platform, if not include separate manned and unmanned components, entirely. It’s also worth remembering that when the Marine Corps drew up its FLRAA requirements , they were markedly different from those specified by the Army, including a cruising speed of 275 knots, or more than 310 miles per hour, and a top speed of 305 knots, or over 350 miles an hour, to match the performance of the Marine’s existing MV-22 Ospreys. The Army specifications for FLRAA included a top speed of 250 knots, or more than 285 miles per hour, and potentially up to 280 knots, or more than 320 miles per hour. The maximum speed of the UH-60M Black Hawk, by contrast, is just 200 miles per hour. With these differing requirements in mind, it could be that a Marine Corps-optimized FLRAA would be a better fit for the Navy, too. The view from the cockpit of an MH-60S as it conducts maneuvers with the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt ., U.S. Navy All this also speaks to the continuing debate about the value of joint-service programs, especially with regards to aviation, and the struggle to find a platform that can meet such diverse requirements. Already, it seems, the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy have very different and potentially incompatible ideas about what they want from the FVL program. Time will tell whether the Army’s FLRAA will provide a starting point for the Navy’s FVL-MS, or indeed U.S. Marine Corps vertical-lift requirements, but if the naval program is anything like as productive as the Army equivalent, then it may well yield some potentially game-changing results.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 8, 2021",F-117s Cleared To Refuel From All KC-135s As “Retired” Stealth Jets Expand Operations,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC) has issued a formal order that all KC-135 Stratotankers are now cleared to execute aerial refueling operations with F-117 Nighthawks . The order is quite the ‘back to the future’ directive as the F-117 was first cleared for aerial refueling operations in the mid-1980s and has been officially retired for 13 years now, although this really isn’t the case for a number of the remaining ‘Black Jets.’ This new unclassified order, which is titled “Air Refueling Operations Approval for KC-135 and F-117 Aircraft,” states, in part: “HQ AMC/A3V FCIF 21-01-01. This FCIF is approved for release by Maj Gen Joel. D Jackson and applies to all KC-135 units. Retain until rescinded… KC-135s are approved to conduct air refueling operations with the F-117. With no current Standard Related Documents (SRD) guidance available, previous air refueling procedures and the existing F-117 TCA are to this FCIF… Block 45 equipped KC-135s will not refuel with the autopilot engaged… KC-135 crews will review the attached documents prior to flying operations and be familiar with all general information, notes, cautions, and warnings applicable to air refueling F-117s…” A section of F-117s, including the flag scheme jet, fly off a KC-135R’s wing., USAF It is signed by Air Force Major General Joel D. Jackson, the Director of Operations, Strategic Deterrence, and Nuclear Integration, at Headquarters, Air Mobility Command, and has been confirmed as authentic by multiple sources. The now-approved Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), which appears to be dated January 1, 2021, came from Air Mobility Command’s Directorate of Operations, Aircrew Standardization, and Evaluation, or A3V. This serves as additional evidence that the F-117’s post-retirement operations are becoming more widespread and far less reclusive in nature. The F-117s, some of which have remained flying for the vast majority of the type’s official retirement, at least to a limited degree, have drastically expanded their operational footprint in recent years and are now actively acting in the operational test and development support role and as stealthy dissimilar aggressors. Once bound to their original home at the remote Tonopah Test Range Airport (TTR) , the F-117s have ventured increasingly further from it to higher-profile locations, especially in recent months. Now they are even forward deploying to operational airbases in order to support things like carrier strike group work-ups . The F-117s have also even been calling on Nellis Air Force Base in broad daylight as their use as stealth aggressors have broadened , with the type even playing a major role in recent Red Flag international air combat exercises. After the type’s formal retirement, the super-shy pocket force of F-117s was relegated to tanking from a small fleet of test tankers based out of Edwards Air Force Base and KC-10 tankers from Travis Air Force Base that support clandestine flight testing regularly, going by the callsign Sierra 99 . In more recent years, KC-135s that go by the callsign Sierra 98 have also taken up this mission, which usually occurs over or near the expansive and desolate Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) . Making it so any KC-135 can refuel the F-117s will allow them to more easily be integrated into large force employment (LFE) exercises and major training cycles. It also means they will be able to more easily travel much farther from home. As such, it is possible we could see an east coast detachment of F-117s in the not so distant future in order to support an exercise or training evolution with their stealthy characteristics. The F-117 and KC-135 have been tied at the hip since not long after the type’s first flight in 1983. Here two 4450th Tactical Group F-117As refueling from KC-135 tanker and an A-7D chase plane Nevada. Note the aircraft in the foreground with the grey/black paint, this is the first F-117, 780. This photo dates from about 1984, USAF Acting in a stealthy aggressor role , they will help bridge the gap until the services stand up low-observable aggressor forces, whether that be with 5th generation F-35s, which will be arriving to take up this role at Nellis in the near future , or stealthy unmanned aircraft . Regardless, it is absolutely amazing that after 13 years of officially being in mothballs, the Nighthawk force, which amounts to around 45 jets in total , most of which remain partially disassembled in storage at Tonopah, is now significantly expanding its operations. With Red Flag underway right now at Nellis, we may see the F-117s pop up once again towards the end of the big exercise. And this time they can suckle from a standard KC-135R, like the rest of the aggressor force.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 26, 2021",Navy Considers Axing Conformal Fuel Tanks From Its Block III Super Hornet Upgrade Plan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is considering removing conformal fuel tanks , or CFTs, from the Block III upgrade package for its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets after discovering various issues with them during testing. Deciding not to pursue these tanks, which are designed to extend the Super Hornet’s range even without it having to carry drop tanks in place of other underwing stores, could have significant ramifications for the service’s future tactical aviation plans. It could also impact the export prospects for these jets, as well. Aviation Week was the first to report the potentially serious problems with the CFTs on Jan. 28, 2021. Boeing has been flight testing Super Hornets with the tanks as part of the Block III upgrade program since at least 2019. The company had previously experimented with adding CFTs to the aircraft, in cooperation with Northrop Grumman , as part of a proposed Advanced Super Hornet upgrade package , which it publicly unveiled in 2008. Boeing’s Advanced Super Hornet Demonstrator, fitted with conformal fuel tanks., Boeing The Navy told Aviation Week that unspecified “technical, structural, and sustainment” problems had arisen in tests of the CFTs as part of the Block III upgrade effort. The service added that the issues had emerged during testing in a “carrier environment.” While we don’t know what the exact issues are, the Navy’s disclosure that there is a specific link between them and the operation of CFT-equipped jets from its aircraft carriers could suggest the problems have to do, at least in part, with how the upgraded aircraft handle the stresses of catapult launches and arrested recoveries. At the same time, the tanks were designed to handle the strains of high-g aerial maneuvers. Another possibility might be that the tanks have been found to block access to key sections of the aircraft when they are installed, requiring their removal to perform certain routine maintenance and other tasks, adding costly time and effort to those processes. It’s also interesting to note that the section on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet in the latest annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, makes no mention of the conformal fuel tanks, at all. “The Boeing Block III Super Hornet’s advanced capabilities provide the Navy with multiple options for increasing an air wing’s combat effectiveness,” was all Boeing would say in a statement to The War Zone in response to queries about the issues the Navy has uncovered with the CFTs. “Together with the Navy, Boeing will ensure that the Block III remains the most versatile tactical aircraft in the fleet.” The addition of the tanks is just one of the planned Block III upgrades. The full package, which you can find out more about in this previous War Zone piece , also includes new coatings to help reduce the radar signature of the aircraft, new mission computers and data links, and highly customizable wide-area multi-function displays in each cockpit, including the rear ones on two-seat F/A-18Fs. The Navy is also in the process of adding improved satellite communications (SATCOM) systems and the ability to use an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor installed in a modified drop tank, the latter of which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , to its Super Hornets through separate programs. A broad overview of the Navy’s Block III upgrade program for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet., Boeing However, the CFTs are a particularly significant part of the upgrade plan. Two of the aerodynamic CFTs, each of which can hold up to 515 gallons of fuel, are designed to be installed on top of the center “barrel” section of the F/A-18E/F’s fuselage, fitted one on each side of the aircraft’s central spine. At least in principle, this provides significant benefits in range and performance over draggy drop tanks, which can only hold 480 gallons of fuel each. Jets with CFTs can also carry additional stores on underwing pylons that otherwise would have to be set aside to carry the drop tanks. In the past, Boeing has said, by way of example, that a Super Hornet carrying two AIM-9X Sidewinders , two AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), and two 2,000-pound-class precision-guided bombs would have a combat radius of 594 nautical miles with only the fuel in its internal tanks, plus a drop tank on its centerline pylon. With CFTs, a jet with the same loadout would have a combat radius of 714 nautical miles. The CFTs would also help make up for the loss of fuel in the new IRST-equipped centerline drop tanks . Those tanks can only carry 330 gallons of fuel, instead of 480 gallons. An F/A-18E/F with one of these drop tanks, as well as six AIM-120s and two AIM-9Xs, would have a combat radius of around 509 nautical miles, according to Boeing. With CFTs, that would be extended out to 611 nautical miles. An F/A-18F Super Hornet carrying an IRST-equipped drop tank on its centerline pylon., Lockheed Martin The Navy has touted this added range, and the additional stores capacity when operating out to those distances, as an important way to expand the overall capabilities of its carrier air wings. At the same time, it has described the benefits that the CFTs offer, together with the extra range future MQ-25A Stingray tanker drones will also provide, as a critical way to help reduce the vulnerability of its aircraft carriers. Extending the reach of these jets, as well as other aircraft in the carrier air wing, such as the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter , means that flattops can launch them while staying further away from ever-growing anti-access and area denial threats, including advanced anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , especially in any potential future high-end conflict against a near-peer adversary, such as Russia or China . If the Navy now determines that the CFTs are more trouble than they’re worth, its future Block III F/A-18E/Fs will be stuck with the same range and stores capacity limitations as its existing Super Hornets. The aforementioned MQ-25As could help mitigate this, but these drones alone would inherently offer more limited range-extension benefits than they could in combination with CFT-equipped Super Hornets. Those unmanned aircraft will also be heavily in demand to support future carrier air wings’ F-35C Joint Strike Fighters, which cannot, at least at present , carry external drop tanks, at all. Any such external tank would negatively impact the radar-evading qualities of the F-35s to some degree, as well, making it unlikely that these jets would carry them on missions where they would need to be in their most stealthy configuration. The CFTs have also been seen as a feature that could be ported over to the Navy’s EA-18G Growler as part of a Block II upgrade program for those electronic warfare aircraft. These aircraft would also greatly benefit from added range, something that also translates to longer time on station, while simultaneously freeing up underwing pylon space. The EA-18Gs already have to lug around extra fuel, along with large jamming pods , to perform their missions. With the Navy already looking to stop buying new Super Hornets , eliminating the CFTs from the Block III upgrade program could place more emphasis on its efforts to acquire new manned and unmanned carrier-based combat aircraft . The service is still very much in the process of figuring out what exactly its future carrier air wings might look like as it progresses with its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which you can read about more in this previous War Zone piece and should not to be confused with the Air Force’s effort of the same name. A briefing slide showing the Navy’s projected carrier air wing as of 2030, which includes Block III Super Hornets, Block II Growlers, and MQ-25A drones, among other aircraft., USN The Navy cutting the CFTs could have impacts on Boeing’s efforts to pitch Super Hornets with some or all of the Block III features to foreign countries, as well. The tanks are a notable component of the offers the company has submitted in competitions to supply jets to the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Indian Navy , among others. If the problems uncovered so far do turn out to be limited to operations from catapult-equipped carriers, this might be less of an issue. The Indian Navy, for instance, only has one carrier in service, at present, and another under construction, both of which feature ski jumps , rather than catapults. Canada plans to operate whatever new fighter jets it ends up buying from bases on land, as does Germany, which recently decided to acquire F/A-18E/Fs as a partial replacement for its aging Panavia Tornado combat jets . An artist’s conception of an F/A-18E Super Hornet for the Royal Canadian Air Force fitted with conformal fuel tanks., Boeing Artwork depicting an F/A-18F Super Hornet with conformal fuel tanks for the Indian Navy., Boeing It is important to stress that the Navy has not yet made a final decision on how it will proceed, or not, with adding CFTs to its Super Hornet fleet as part of the Block III program. Still, that the service is considering axing the tanks from the planned slate of upgrades at all is a significant development that signals there are real challenges preventing the full potential benefits they offer from being realized.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 16, 2020",The Russian Navy Has Gotten Its First New Electrically-Powered Torpedo Since The Cold War,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An advanced electrically-powered torpedo has entered service with the Russian Navy, marking the first time the service has introduced a new weapon of this type since the Soviet era. Electric designs are typically easier to make, simpler to maintain, and less risky to handle than those that use a chemically-powered propulsion system, and also offer certain performance benefits. Boris Obnosov, general director of Russia’s Tactical Missiles Corporation (KTRV), which produces a wide variety of ordnance, including missiles , bombs, and naval weapons, confirmed in a recent interview that the introduction of the new torpedo took place sometime last year. The name and most other details of the new torpedo have not yet been disclosed, however. “In 2020, we completed state tests of the first Russian [as opposed to Soviet] electric torpedo,” Obnosov told Russia’s Military-Industrial Courier newspaper . “In the USSR, they were produced, but with less high-performance characteristics. Today, the first series-production examples of new electric torpedoes have already entered service with the Russian Navy.” Russian Navy torpedoes stowed on their racks aboard a submarine. , Marina Lystseva/TASS Obnosov added that the new weapon was considered “significantly superior to Western models in terms of noiselessness, range, immersion depth and target detection range by the homing system,” but offered no specific details about its capabilities. Last August, it was reported that KTRV had received the go-ahead to launch serial production of a new type of torpedo, although at this point it was not announced that it was an electric torpedo. Although Obnosov didn’t reveal any more information about the new torpedo beyond its propulsion type, it is possible that he was referring to the TE-2, a KTRV product developed by the Gidropribor design house that is described by the corporation as a “multipurpose electric remotely controlled homing torpedo.” The company says this weapon is intended to destroy both submarines and large surface vessels, as well as “stationary surface targets,” which could include port infrastructure. The TE-2 can be launched from standard 21-inch caliber torpedo tubes on submarines, as well as surface ships. It has a length of around 27 feet when configured for submarine launch and weighs around 5,400 pounds, including its 550-pound high-explosive warhead that’s detonated by an active proximity electromagnetic fuze. The manufacturer claims it has a maximum range of 15.5 miles and a top speed of 45 knots. A TE-2 torpedo., Rosoboronexport While versions of the TE-2 can be fired from surface ships and submarines, KTRV says that only the latter can employ variants of the weapon that feature wire guidance. Wire-guided torpedos can change their attack geometry or even shut down entirely if directed by the fire-control operator. This method also offers a better chance of defeating countermeasures, such as decoys and jammers , since the operator can call upon the submarine’s sonar data instead of the torpedo’s lower-fidelity onboard sonar data. You can read more about all of this in-depth in this previous War Zone story . Another possibility is that Obnosov was talking about the UET-1, another multipurpose electric torpedo, and apparently a rival to the TE-2, which is also manufactured by KTRV. Very little is known about this weapon other than that it was designed by the Dagdiesel enterprise in Dagestan on the Caspian Sea. The UET-1 is described as a replacement for the Soviet-era USET-80 , another electric torpedo that first entered service in 1980 and that is now considered obsolete. Two other Cold War-era torpedoes on display in Kaliningrad: the 400-millimeter caliber SET-40 (nearest camera) and the 533-millimeter/21-inch caliber SET-65., Zenwort/Wikimedia Commons In 2018, it was reported that the Russian Navy had signed a contract to buy a total of 73 UET-1 torpedoes between 2019 and 2023, valued at 7.2 billion roubles, around $110 million at the then-current exchange rate. A year later, the Submarine Matters blog cited an unnamed Russian submarine expert who claimed the TE-2 had not been ordered by the Russian Navy and that work on the UET-1 was being prioritized instead. That timeline would also be broadly in keeping with Obnosov’s announcement of service entry in 2020. The same blog also provides some of the few details of the UET-1 torpedo’s specifications that are available. These include a maximum range of 31 miles and a maximum speed of 50 knots, which suggests its performance outstrips that of the TE-2. It’s not clear what kind of guidance options are available for the UET-1. Russia notably already fields torpedoes with advanced wake-homing capabilities , which zero in on their targets by detecting differences in water density from their wake. This makes it largely immune to existing acoustic decoys and electronic warfare jammers. Whatever the exact torpedo type that Russia has now adopted is, any new electrically-powered weapon would offer certain benefits over “thermal” designs that use some kind of chemically-powered propulsion system. Electric torpedoes are far safer to handle, as well as being generally easier to produce. Maintenance is also more straightforward. For example, KTRV says the TE-2 can be stored for up to 18 months on a shelf or in an empty tube or six months in a tube that’s periodically flooded with water. The practice of flooding and emptying a torpedo tube on a Russian submarine is something you can see in action here , while the complex process of loading and then firing a torpedo from a submarine has also been looked at in detail by The War Zone in the past. The added safety benefits could be particularly of interest to the Russian Navy, which has experienced some high-profile torpedo-related accidents in the past involving chemically-powered torpedoes. The most deadly of these was the loss of the Oscar class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea in August 2000. On that occasion, the failure of one of the submarine’s thermal torpedoes triggered an explosion that led to 118 deaths. The sail of the submarine Kursk has been preserved as a memorial in Murmansk., Christopher Michel/Wikimedia Commons There are other advantages to electric torpedoes, too, as retired U.S. Navy submarine sonarman Aaron Amick explained in a previous War Zone story on this subject: They also have some capabilities thermal torpedoes do not. These high-torque, permanent magnet electric motor torpedoes ramp up to speed in under a second. They go from sitting in a torpedo tube to 50 knots in a near-instant because they don’t have the mechanical lag and inertia thermal torpedoes must overcome during start-up. Furthermore, electric torpedoes are often modular designs, allowing batteries to be connected in series to give certain versions of a particular weapon more range, while fewer batteries can produce lighter and more agile, but shorter-legged variants. However, it is not clear that the new Russian weapon has this option. Traditionally, electric torpedoes have been quieter than their thermal counterparts, too. However, that advantage has narrowed over the years and many modern thermal torpedoes now have features that significantly reduce their acoustic signature. General Lieutenant Anatoly Gulyaev, the Chief of the Main Department for Armaments of the Russian Armed Forces, visits the Dagdizel plant to sign a contract for the UET-1., Russian Ministry of Defense KTRV’s Obnosov did not say how widely the new torpedo has been fielded so far, but one would expect examples of the Russian Navy’s newest submarines to have been given priority to receive the new weapons. Among the submarines with 21-inch caliber torpedo tubes that could accommodate the new weapons are the Borei class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine , Yasen class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines , and the Lada class diesel-electric attack submarine . Russian Navy submarine Sankt Peterburg , the first, and so far the only member of the Lada class to enter service., Radziun/Wikimedia Commons Russian surface combatants also traditionally have torpedo tubes fitted, and the Admiral Grigorovich class frigate would be one possible candidate for the new weapon. However, smaller Russian warships now being built, such as the Steregushchiy class corvette , are increasingly opting for 330-millimeter caliber torpedo tubes. These are notably capable of launching the smaller Paket-NK torpedoes , which are innovative dual-use weapons suitable for defeating both submarines and enemy torpedoes. In recent years, Russia’s efforts to develop new-generation naval weapons for its submarines and surface combatants have focused on more capable cruise missiles , including hypersonic weapons , as well as air defense systems . However, torpedoes, in general, remain very potent weapons for use against submarines and surface targets, especially when fired by advanced submarines designed to be difficult to detect, to begin with, including nuclear types , as well as non-nuclear boats with ultra-quiet air-independent diesel-electric propulsion systems. No matter what, a new electrically-powered torpedo to replace aging Soviet-era types that remain in service can only be a boon for the Russian Navy’s submarine and surface fleets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2020",Top Navy Intel Officer Hopes China Will Keep Dumping Money Into Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s top intelligence officer has said the service is watching closely as China expands its anti-ship missile capabilities , particularly in and around the disputed South China Sea , to include the ongoing development of long-range anti-ship ballistic missiles . At the same time, he said he “hopes” that China’s People’s Liberation Army will continue to invest significant resources into these efforts, hinting that the U.S. Navy already has extensive measures to counter these threats already in use now or in development. Navy Vice Admiral Jeffrey Trussler, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare, made his remarks about China’s anti-ship missile arsenal during an online event put on by the non-profit Intelligence and National Security Alliance on Jan. 27, 2021. His comments come just over two months after a report that the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had successfully struck a moving target ship near the Paracel Island chain in the South China Sea with at least one ballistic missile fired from the Chinese mainland during an exercise earlier last year. The Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and other ships train in the Pacific in 2020., USN Following that report, Navy Admiral Philip Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), speaking at the 2020 Halifax International Security Forum, another virtual event, confirmed that Chinese forces had fired a ballistic missile at a moving target during the August 2020 exercise in the South China Sea. However, he would not say whether or not the test was successful. If it was, that would mean the Chinese are the first to have actually demonstrated a long-range anti-ship ballistic missile capability, which could have significant ramifications for the U.S. military, as well as those of other countries, when it comes to maritime operations in that region and elsewhere in the Pacific. Vice Admiral Trussler, in his remarks yesterday, made clear that the Navy is paying close attention to China’s development of the DF-21D and DF-26B anti-ship ballistic missiles, but declined, when asked, to say whether or not the U.S. Intelligence Community believes that the PLARF has “fully fielded” the DF-21D, specifically. “I’m not going to get [into] much more detail of what we know and don’t know about it.” The DF-21D and DF-26B are variants of the DF-21 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that are understood to have maneuvering reentry vehicles able to hit large ships, such as aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. The DF-21D has a range of at least 932 miles, while DF-26-series missiles can reach targets out to 2,500 miles, according to the Pentagon . If these missiles are indeed viable anti-ship weapons, they would give the PLA a way to carry out very-long range strikes on enemy fleets from well within the relative safety of the Chinese mainland. https://youtube.com/watch?v=hqU76dINtqQ A map with rings representing the approximate ranges of various Chinese conventional strike weapons including the DF-21D, referred to here as the “CSS-5 ASBM,” and the DF-26. The map also includes a ring to reflect the range of H-6J bombers armed with anti-ship cruise missiles., DOD The PLA is also steadily growing its arsenal of ground-launched anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as surface and air-launched types, to include supersonic and potentially hypersonic designs . “They’re pouring a lot of money in the ability to basically rim their coast in the South China Sea with anti-ship missile capability,” Vice Admiral Trussler said. “It’s a destabilizing effort in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, all those areas,” he continued. “When you see that – those are troubling developments. They’re probably aimed and specifically developed towards the United States Navy.” The aircraft carriers USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan , together with elements of their respective Carrier Strikes Groups, sail in the South China Sea in 2020., USN It’s no secret that the U.S. Navy, among others around the world, are increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of their ships to advanced anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles. Similarly, the PLA is well aware of all of this and, as Trussler notes, has made these capabilities a cornerstone of its efforts to establish dense, layered anti-access and area denial bubbles around its territory, particularly in areas where it has expansive and widely disputed territorial claims, such as in the South China Sea . It also seems clear the Chinese military sees the U.S. military as its chief competitor in the Pacific. Earlier this month, elements of the PLA’s Southern Theater Command held a drill in the South China Sea, subsequently releasing video footage showing members of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) telling a notional “enemy” in English that “You are surrounded. Surrender!” “Those PLAN intentions. So opaque. So tough to read,” a subsequent Tweet from the official account of the Navy’s Office of the Chief of Information, or CHINFO, the service’s top public affairs office, read. However, not only did Vice Admiral Trussler seem less concerned about PLA anti-ship missile capabilities than one would expect, he made clear he was happy with them continuing to pour time and resources into those efforts. “I hope they just keep pouring money into that type of thing,” he said. “That may not be how we win the next war.” The clear indication here is that Trussler is aware of countermeasures, whether they be certain systems or tactics, techniques, and procedures, that are either available now or in development. The Vice Admiral did not offer any specific details about what the Navy is doing to go along with these remarks. In December, the Navy, together with the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, did release a new, overarching naval strategy , which focused heavily on future distributed concepts of operation that could make the movements of maritime forces less predictable and make it harder for opponents to spot and then effectively engage them. The document defined, in broad terms, Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) as follows: “An operations concept that leverages the principles of distribution, integration, and maneuver to mass overwhelming combat power and effects at the time and place of our choosing. This integration of distributed platforms, weapons, systems, and sensors via low probability of intercept and detection networks, improves our battlespace awareness while complicating the enemy’s own scouting efforts. Applying combat power through maneuver within and across all domains allows our forces to exploit uncertainty and achieve surprise.” When it comes to ships, the Navy is increasingly looking at a future fleet with larger numbers of smaller ships , including both manned, as well as and unmanned types capable of performing a variety of different missions , to further support distributed operations concepts . These developments are being driven, in part, by a dramatic reorganization of the Marine Corps’ force structure that is also ongoing and that places a significant emphasis on getting away from a reliance on relatively large, traditional amphibious warfare ships . Two unmanned ships the Navy, together with the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office, have been testing in recent years as part of a program known as Ghost Fleet Overlord., USN We also know that, by 2019, warships assigned to the Navy’s 7th Fleet, which is based in Japan, were fitted with the AN/SLQ-59 Transportable Electronic Warfare Modules (TEWM). TEWM is described as a “counter-terminal threat defensive system,” indicating that it is designed to help defeat incoming anti-ship missiles, or other threats, such as swarms of small drones, in the final phase of their attack on a ship. Based on the information available, The War Zone previously assessed that the AN/SLQ-59 was most likely acquired in response to growing cruise missile threats, and Chinese developments, in particular, given its fielding first on ships forward-deployed in Japan. AN/SLQ-59 Transportable Electronic Warfare Module installation on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur. , USN The Navy has also been hard at work developing an entire networked electronic warfare “ecosystem,” as part of its shadowy Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors program, or NEMESIS. The goal here has been to craft a ‘system of systems’ comprising of various manned and unmanned ships, as well as submarines and aircraft, equipped with electronic warfare systems that can work together cooperatively. One of the key uses of these capabilities would be to generate signals that mimic real fleets of ships and aircraft to distract and confuse opponents, making it difficult for them to effectively spot and target real Navy assets. These networked electronic warfare platforms could also employ other kinds of electronic warfare tactics across a broad area to protect against various kinds of threats. You can read more about NEMSIS in detail in this past War Zone feature . A briefing slide offering an extremely broad overview of the NEMESIS program., USN A highly adaptive and deeply networked electronic warfare ecosystem could be particularly useful against long-range anti-ship missile strikes, especially using ballistic missiles, which would require targeting information from offboard platforms and the ability to send updated information to the weapon during the mid-course stage of flight. It remains unclear how the Chinese are cueing missiles, such as the DF-21D and DF-26B, against maritime targets. However, China’s own warships and maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft , as well as increasingly capable high-altitude, long-endurance drones , tethered aerostats , ground-based radars and other sensors , and space-based systems could all help in spotting and tracking enemy fleets. It’s worth noting that the Navy employs a number of anti-missile decoy systems already to protect ships from cruise missile attacks, too. This is all in addition to kinetic close-in defenses, such as the 20mm Vulcan cannon-armed Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) and the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM), as well as more traditional surface-to-air missiles , all of which can help knock down incoming cruise missiles. When it comes to ballistic missiles, as well as emerging hypersonics weapons, another area of great interest to the Chinese military , these present significantly different challenges from cruise missiles for defenders at sea, as well as on land, as you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone piece . The Navy does have Arleigh Burke class destroyers outfitted specifically for ballistic missile defense , including the ability to launch the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor , which is designed to knock down ballistic missiles during the mid-course portion of their flight. Those ships are also slated to get interceptors designed to bring down hypersonic weapons in the future as part of the Regional Glide Phase Weapon System (RGPWS) program. Right now, though, there’s no guarantee that ships tasked with missile defense will be in an optimal position relative to an incoming strike involving ballistic missiles with maneuvering reentry vehicles, let alone ones tipped with hypersonic boost-glide vehicles . Even if they are, they may well be overwhelmed by the total number of incoming threats. A barrage of low-flying high-supersonic or hypersonic cruise missiles could similarly threaten to overwhelm close-in defenses on individual ships. The Navy, which has been looking to stop deploying Arleigh Burkes on dedicated missile defense missions , could seek to make more widespread use of the SM-3 Block IIA in the future. Those destroyers and other ships could gain additional missile defense capabilities as the improved Block IB variant of the SM-6 missile begins to enter service. Existing Block I and IA versions of the SM-6 already have the ability to intercept ballistic missiles during the terminal phase of their flight, as well as engage various other aerial and surface threats. The SM-6, in particular, potentially provides a potent defense against anti-ship ballistic missiles, especially those that break through mid-course traditional ballistic missile defenses, if mid-course ballistic missile defense assets are available at all. There’s the possibility that Vice Admiral Trussler is aware of other developments in the classified realm that could further mitigate some or all of these threats, as well. Beyond that, there’s no discounting that his public comments, which are certain to be scrutinized by the PLA itself, are a form of misinformation designed to prompt concerns within the Chinese military that its priorities may be, in some way, seriously off base. Whatever the case, the threat posed by China’s anti-ship missile arsenal, which continues to grow in capability, including with the development of new anti-ship ballistic missiles, is real. At the same time, while the Navy obviously knows this, the service seems to be strongly hinting that it feels it making very good progress on getting around these challenges, or at least wants to make the Chinese think so.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 27, 2021","First Contractor-Owned F-16 Aggressors Include MiG Killers, Veteran Of Iraqi Reactor Raid (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New details have come to light about the initial four ex-Israeli Air Force F-16s heading to North America to join Top Aces. This company is the first private contractor offering red air adversary support to get its hands on a fourth-generation fighter, which you can read more about in The War Zone â€™s initial report on these aircraft. We now know that, during their previous combat careers in Israel, three of these jets brought down Syrian MiGs during the conflict in Lebanon in the early 1980s, and one of them also took part in the long-range daytime bombing raid on Iraqâ€™s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. Itâ€™s long been known that the Israeli Air Forceâ€™s (IAF) fleet of F-16A/B Netz fighter jets, originally delivered in the early 1980s and retired in 2016 , saw considerable operational use . A new photo of the first four aircraft headed for Top Acesâ€™ operation in Mesa, Arizona, confirms that they include three F-16As with serial numbers 129/78-0322, 220/78-0327, and 250/78-0346, as well as a single two-seat F-16B, carrying the serial 017/78-0362. With this information, it is possible to get a good sense of their combat history. An F-16 is loaded onto the Antonov Airlines An-124 at Ben Gurion Airport., Israeli Ministry of Defense Photos that emerged yesterday had shown the F-16s with their wings and tail surfaces removed, waiting to be loaded onto a Ukrainian-registered An-124 cargo aircraft for transport to the United States, but without the serial numbers visible. The An-124 departed Ben Gurion Airport, outside Tel Aviv, yesterday and then landed in Iceland for an overnight stop. Online flight-tracking information indicates that its final destination is Phoenix, Arizona, where the aircraft should arrive today. So, letâ€™s now examine more closely what we know about the backgrounds of these particular jets. F-16A Netz 129 This Block 5 single-seater, which also received the U.S. Air Force serial number 78-0322 and has the General Dynamics construction number 6V-15, was originally allocated to an Iranian order, codenamed Peace Zebra, which was canceled after the revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979. It was then rolled into the Peace Marble I order of 1978, which was the first Israeli F-16 acquisition and covered 75 aircraft. Delivered to the IAF in 1980, Netz 129 was assigned to 117 Squadron. The jet took part in the attack on the French-made Osiris-class nuclear reactor in Iraq, also known as Osirak, on June 7 the following year, also known as Operation Opera. According to F-16.net , the jet was flown by Hagai Katz and was the fourth of the eight F-16s involved to drop its bombs.Â During the mission, each of the jets was loaded with two 2,000-pound-class Mk 84 bombs with delay fuses, and the strike package was escorted by six F-15As. Against great odds, the mission was a huge success. If the reactor had not been destroyed, it could have helped provide a clear pathway to Iraq becoming the first nuclear-armed Arab nation in the Middle East. The images in the tweet below show Netz 129 as it appeared immediately before Operation Opera, and again as it was loaded onboard the An-124 for transport yesterday.Â ×¢× ×›×œ ×”×›×‘×•×“ ×œ×¨×‘×™×¢×™×™×ª ×”××˜×•×¡×™×, ×”×¦×™×•×¥ ×”×–×” ××•×§×“×© ×œ""× ×¥"" ××¡×¤×¨ 129, ×©×™×¦× ×‘- 7 ×‘×™×•× ×™ 1981 ×‘××‘× ×” ""××–××œ"" ×œ×ª×§×™×¤×ª ×”×›×•×¨ ×”×’×¨×¢×™× ×™ ×‘×¢×™×¨××§ ×‘××¡×’×¨×ª ××‘×¦×¢ ""××•×¤×¨×”"". ×›××Ÿ ×‘×¦×™×œ×•× ×”×™×¡×˜×•×¨×™ ×××‘×¦×¢ ×”×ª×§×™×¤×” ×•×œ×™×“×• ×ª××•× ×•×ª ××”×¢××¡×ª×• ×¢×œ ×”×× ×˜×•× ×•×‘ ××ª××•×œ pic.twitter.com/8XKG12AHdy — ××™×ª×™ ×‘×œ×•×× ×˜×œ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡± Itay Blumental (@ItayBlumental) January 28, 2021 During its IAF career, Netz 129 also received the individual name Hanit , while markings were applied to the nose to commemorate the Osirak strike, as well as half of a Syrian Air Force roundel, denoting the shared destruction of an enemy aircraft. This incident apparently took place on June 9, 1982, when the jet was being flown by future astronaut Eytan Stibbe. Both Stibbe, and Eliezer Shakedi, in another Netz, each used an AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile to down a Syrian Arab Air Force MiG-23 Flogger combat jet during the intense air war over Lebanon.

This Netz is not known to have seen any combat service, reflecting the fact that these early-model two-seaters were used almost exclusively for training.Â This Block 5, and others, was upgraded once in service to bring them to a common Block 10 standard. Overall, the Netz fleet was further modernized, too, and the aircraft reportedly are now broadly equivalent in terms of capability to an F-16 Block 15 OCU jet, but still retained the original head-up display.

It remains to be seen what other combat records are associated with the remaining jets that Top Aces has now acquired. In fact, the exact number of jets that the company is getting remains unclear, although it has been cleared to buy as many as 29. Some of those jets could provide the Canadian contractor with its own flying movie stars, too â€” it was Israeli Netz jets that helped introduce the world to the F-16, in the 1986 air combat yarn Iron Eagle .

This left five helicopters, which was not enough to carry on with a mission that required 120 men to ultimately arrive safely in Tehran to affect the rescue. Delta Force commander U.S. Army Colonel Charlie Beckwith, in charge of the mission’s ground element, called for the abort. The message was transmitted all the way up to the chain of command to the White House, where President Jimmy Carter deferred to the judgment of the men on the ground. The mission was over. The hostages were not going to be rescued, at least not during the remaining days of April 1980.

In the darkness and the swirling sand, his only point of reference was an Air Force Combat Controller standing forward and to the right of the Sea Stallion. To avoid getting lashed with blowing sand, the Combat Controller backed away. Without any other positioning references, this was perceived by Schaefer as though his helicopter was drifting backward. It was not. Schaefer corrected for the perceived drift by applying forward stick and crashed into one of the parked EC-130E Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center ( ABCCC ) aircraft, which had brought fuel for the helicopters so they could press on to Tehran to accomplish their rescue mission. Both the Sea Stallion and Combat Talon were engulfed in a fireball, leading to pandemonium at Desert One .

Eight Americans were killed, the RH-53D and the EC-130E it had collided with were destroyed, and the remaining five helicopters were abandoned in the Iranian desert. The events that occurred at Desert One in the early morning of April 25, 1980, became a moment that would live in infamy. Forty years later, a burning question lingers: what if? What if the mission had not been canceled? What if the three helicopters had not suffered mechanical failures on the way? Could they have made it all the way to Tehran and successfully rescued the hostages? Maybe. And that’s a big maybe . A dark hour In response to the abhorrent act in Iran, our Nation has never been aroused and unified so greatly in peacetime. Our position is clear. The United States will not yield to blackmail. – President Jimmy Carter, State of the Union, January 23, 1980 On November 4, 1979, Iranian protesters and terrorists seized the American embassy, kicking off an excruciating ordeal that ended 444 days later on January 20, 1981. It was arguably the first shot fired in a now four-decade-long shadow war between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, which, in 1979, had recently overthrown the last vestiges of its imperial, monarchical past and established one of the world’s largest – and most violent – theocracies, in the unstable and war-ridden Middle East. This enduring U.S-Iran conflict looms large in the present day, as recent tensions threaten to engulf the region in war. But the United States and Iran have seldom come closer to war than they did in 1980. Since the Desert One debacle, U.S. troops have not set foot on Iran territory—at least that we know of—and both sides have only exchanged direct fire on a few occasions, waging the fight from the shadows or via proxies instead. Holding 52 Americans hostage, all of them diplomats or military personnel, certainly upped the ante in a way unrivaled until recent events such as the January 3, 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani and the subsequent ballistic missile attack on an Iraqi base that hosted U.S. troops. Finally, the Iran hostage crisis came at a time when the United States was least geared for a major conflict in the Middle East. The economy was in stagnation, energy prices were high, the U.S. military had left Vietnam only four years prior, and there were questions about America’s ability to effectively address the Soviet threat. It was a low point of sorts for the country and the sight of burned-out aircraft and charred bodies in the Iranian desert with nothing to show for it was an unpleasant wake-up call. Operation Eagle Claw could have delivered a huge victory for the nation at a time when it desperately needed one. Instead, Americans were subjected to a shocking, demoralizing loss. An aerial view of Desert One the morning after the hostage rescue attempt., via SOCOM “The guts to try” The mission had to be considered high risk because people and equipment were called upon to perform at the upper limits of human capacity and equipment capability. There was little margin to compensate for mistakes or plain bad luck. – The Holloway Report (IV. Conclusions) In the end, however, the hostages all returned home alive, a fact that serves as a point of contemplation about the crisis in retrospect. But, for now, imagine a counterfactual in which the helicopter never collided with the parked plane. Better yet, imagine a scenario where all eight helicopters made it to Desert One , refueled, and, ultimately, the men of Operation Eagle Claw made it to Tehran and were in position to affect a rescue of the hostages. How successful could they expect to be? Even the most state-of-the-art in counterfactual analysis cannot determine whether the mission would have succeeded had it continued, let alone how close the rescue team would have come to success. There are simply too many gambles and unknown variables to consider for even the most astute analyst or historian to convincingly argue the exact outcome of Eagle Claw had it not failed at Desert One . It is, however, worth examining the facts of the mission to describe and assess what the men of Eagle Claw would have had to accomplish in order to succeed. Doing so not only allows observers to decide for themselves how likely the mission was to have been a success, but it also creates a sense of appreciation for the sorts of odds the men were up against. President Jimmy Carter, alongside Vice President Walter Mondale, bows his head in prayer during a special service for the hostages at the National Cathedral in late-1979., AP / Ira Schwarz “ The Holloway Report ,” an official post-incident investigation chaired by retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Holloway III, zeroed in on the events at Desert One , citing a wide range of issues contributing to the mission’s abrupt end there. The number of helicopters sent on the mission, quite likely, remains the most contentious factor of all. The Holloway Report’s judgment on the matter was as follows: Planning was adequate except for the number of backup helicopters and provisions for weather contingencies. A larger helicopter force and better provisions for weather penetration would have increased the probability of mission success . The investigation board qualified its remarks later in the report, however, stating: It is too simplistic to suggest that adding more helicopters would have reduced the likelihood of the mission aborting due to mechanical failure. The problematic advantages of an increased helicopter force must be balanced against the increased threat posed to [operational security] throughout the continuum of training, deployment, and execution and the reduced contingency fuel reserve at Desert One. In retrospect, it appears that on balance an increase in the helicopter force was warranted; however, such an increase could not itself guarantee success. While there is no way to know whether additional helicopters would have assured success, there is no question that any discussion of the mission going any further than Desert One begins and ends on that point. Colonel Beckwith had assessed a minimum of six choppers were required for the mission to continue, otherwise, he would need to leave men and equipment behind and attempt a high-risk rescue understaffed and under-resourced. By a margin of one helicopter, the mission was aborted. History is often determined by the slimmest of margins and the proverbial coin toss, but this did not make the disappointment any easier to swallow. President Carter latched onto the narrative, remarking in 2015, “I wish I had sent one more helicopter to get the hostages, and we would have rescued them and I would have been reelected.” The Eagle Claw after-action report drew roughly the same conclusion: had it been known there existed even a “remote” possibility that three helicopters would suffer failure in a relatively short period of time, the task force responsible for planning the mission would have called for at least 10 helicopters to be deployed on the mission to mitigate this risk. But, again, the success or failure of the mission came down to more than just the number of helicopters. Predicting mechanical failure is an imperfect science and the lack of reliable meteorological forecasts inside Iran were wild cards the mission had no choice but to roll the dice on. Furthermore, any additional helicopters would have been vulnerable to these same factors. Two Navy RH-53D helicopters are brought up to the Nimitz ’s flight deck via elevator, April 1980., USN It is a wide-open question as to how many more helicopters could have and should have been sent on the mission; consider instead the possibility that Eagle Claw had everything it needed at Desert One to press onward. After all, the minimum six helicopters required to continue with the mission had made it that far and, at least in the mind of U.S. Air Force Colonel James Kyle, two of the three helos were aborted unnecessarily. Colonel Kyle served as the mission’s air element commander and was the on-scene commander at Desert One . In his 1994 account of the incident, Kyle delivers his verdict on why the mission failed: It is my firm belief that the Joint Task Force never had less than seven flyable RH-53s that entire night. What’s more, some highly experienced helicopter pilots have told me that all eight helicopters should have made it to the [hide site] with the five in the best shape completing the mission. The first helo to abort was Bluebeard 6 , after the Blade Inspection Method (BIM) warning lights came on. Approximately 150 miles inside Iran, the RH-53D landed immediately to inspect the rotor blades, which were hollow and filled with nitrogen gas. A loss of gas would trigger the BIM warning, an indication of a crack in the rotors, thereby jeopardizing the aircraft and its crew. Bluebeard 8 landed alongside Bluebeard 6 . The crew of the latter determined the helo was no longer safe to fly, transferring equipment, classified material, and themselves to 8 , then forging ahead to Desert One , minus one chopper. Kyle is not so sure 6 needed to be abandoned, however. “Sikorsky had run extensive tests on RH-53D rotor blades removed for BIM warnings and found all still demonstrated structural integrity,” he explained. “Moreover, Sikorsky performed a blade failure fatigue analysis and found that at reduced weights and airspeeds, rotor blades with cracked spars would retain structural integrity for up to seventy-nine hours.” Bluebeard 6 should have flown on, no question, in the mind of Kyle. He finds it difficult to fault the decision by its Marine pilots, however – the RH-53D was a Navy asset. The CH-53s the Marines were familiar with had recently endured crashes associated with BIM warnings, so it was difficult to regard the same warning aboard the RH-53Ds as anything other than a call to stop flying. By the same token, Kyle believes the helicopter would have continued the mission had its pilots been more familiar with the operating limits of Navy variant H-53. US Marines disembark from a CH-53D Sea Stallion during an exercise in 1981., USMC It is the abort of Bluebeard 5 Kyle finds inexcusable. At 167 miles and 25 minutes from Desert One , the Sea Stallion turned back for its base at sea, the nuclear-powered supercarrier USS Nimitz sailing in the Gulf of Oman. The mission had run into severe unexpected sandstorms, or haboobs , that meteorologists failed to forecast. Visibility deteriorated, making it difficult for the helicopters to maintain formation. The temperature inside the uncomfortably warm aircraft cabin rose dramatically to a dreadful 100 degrees. It was also inside the haboob that Bluebeard 2 ’s second-stage hydraulic system failed, setting up the fateful decision at the landing zone to abort the mission. The video below shows an especially severe haboob in Tehran in 2014, giving a sense of how serious they can potentially be. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rjNH8ga3HcU The crew of Bluebeard 5 , like those in the other helicopters, had distanced themselves from the other aircraft to avoid a collision and the pilots were suffering from disorientation and vertigo. While increasing altitude to get above the sandstorm was an option, it was ruled out due to fears of detection by Iranian radar. After losing sight of 7 , the pilots determined they were lost and, after weighing the risks, decided to return to Nimitz . Kyle believes the pilot essentially lost his nerve, failing to consider his options thoroughly, and looked for a reason to turn around rather than push on. Questioning his decision-making, Kyle wonders, “…after turning around, the [ Bluebeard 5 ] crew broke radio silence to notify the Nimitz that they were returning. If that warranted breaking radio silence, why not do it to obtain information that could prevent the abort?” Simply put, if the Bluebird 5 crew were willing to jeopardize operational security by broadcasting over the radio, better to do so to find a way to fly on, instead of risking the rest of the force for little gain other than to essentially abandon the mission. “There were three other choppers out in front of him,” continued Kyle, “And those crews did not know the weather conditions at Desert-I [sic] either. Yet they had the guts to keep going, and they made it. No. 5 should have too!” Bluebeard 2 , the third and decisive abort, does not escape Kyle’s criticisms either. Citing conversations with numerous pilots, including the one that flew the problematic helicopter to Desert One in 1980, he concludes “this helicopter could have been flown on just one hydraulic system, observing certain precautions.” Furthermore, Kyle quoted the grounded helo’s pilot, B.J. McGuire, as wanting to press on, but being overruled by his superior, Marine Lieutenant Colonel Edward Seiffert. Both Kyle and McGuire were on the same page regarding the gravity and urgency of the mission. From Desert One to Delta Force’s insertion point was two-plus hours of flying; it was close enough to risk flying on. If 2 was truly unairworthy, it could have been abandoned after offloading its Delta Force operators or flown just a bit further to the helicopter hide-site and abandoned there. The number of choppers was important as far as getting to the hide-sites; as will be seen later, less than six operational helos would not necessarily result in mission failure. From a risk assessment standpoint, Kyle seems to believe the rewards clearly outweighed the risk. A decision table offering commanders options and continue/abort criteria under specific scenarios., DOD Left unanswered, however, is what would have come of the occupants of that chopper had it failed en route to the hide-sites. The other aircraft could not accommodate them, and a rescue mission so far inland would have been extremely risky if not impossible to attempt. In fact, a search-and-rescue (SAR) mission was planned using the then-new HH-53H Pave Low helicopters flown by Air Force personnel, but any SAR attempt would not have taken place for at least 30 hours after the Eagle Claw began, since these forces would not be pre-deployed in-theater for operational security reasons. Furthermore, there was no telling, given potential changes in the tactical, operational, or even strategic picture, whether such a mission would be possible 30 hours after U.S. troops entered Iran. That left escape and evasion the only alternative, and a highly unfavorable one at that. Kyle insists the situation called for such risks to be taken, describing the mission as akin to the “Super Bowl” and saying that all the stops should have been pulled to make it happen. More importantly, Kyle believes that the mission was more than likely to be successful, had they carried on. “All that was lacking was the guts to try!” he cites as the missing ingredient. But, like many of the mission’s elements, the decision to fly on in the face of blinding sandstorms and a failed hydraulic system were tricky gambles. Colonel Beckwith and the mission’s other planners had staked the mission’s success on 93 members of Delta Force, a 13-man team composed of Army Special Forces soldiers, a.k.a. “Green Berets,” 12 drivers and Farsi linguists, and two former Iranian military officers participating as advisers – a total of 120 men – all making it to the embassy with all their equipment. The amount of weight toted by each man (270 pounds, bodyweight included) was a critical aspect of the decision to begin the mission with eight helicopters and proceed with a minimum of six. Weight is, after all, a limiting factor in flight. Each additional pound aboard must be compensated with fuel, adding still more weight to the aircraft, but there is also a limit to how much fuel, and gross weight overall, that can ultimately be carried. Members of Delta Force board a cargo plane in Wadi Kena, Egypt, to fly to Masirah, Oman., Public Domain Had the six helicopters forged on and Bluebeard 2 broke down en route, the mission would have needed to be canceled or Colonel Beckwith would have had to make the decision to execute the mission with less than 120 people, something he and the rest of the mission’s command team had not intended to do. Finally, the broken-down helicopter and its occupants would be truly stranded. It would be impossible to cram 120 men aboard five helicopters without disposing of millions of dollars’ worth of valuable military equipment, assuming they could even accommodate the extra bodies aboard the helicopters at all. Those folks would then become liabilities to the mission and, as mentioned previously, there was no guarantee a rescue mission could or would be mounted, let alone in a timely fashion. In retrospect, Colonel Kyle’s judgment might be valid, but so was Colonel Beckwith’s judgment in the heat of the moment. It simply is not feasible to plan for a mission requiring 120 personnel and their equipment making it all the way to the embassy, only to take a chance on a helicopter that has suffered a flight control system failure in an austere environment hundreds of miles from safety. With each helicopter ferrying over 5,000 pounds of men and equipment, their systems would be taxed to their limits, so moving forward under these conditions with a faulty aircraft seems severely reckless. There was no assurance, other than “the guts to try,” as Kyle insists, to breed any kind of confidence in such a leap of faith. Such analysis is bold, to say the least, but the act of pressing on could very well have led to an even bigger and more convoluted hostage crisis, or far worse. This was a belief related post-mission by Colonel Beckwith to the late Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski was President Carter’s National Security Adviser and an avid proponent of a rescue attempt. As Carter weighed whether to abort or continue the mission, Brzezinski had considered recommending that the rescue force continue despite the failure of three of the helicopters. When asked by Brzezinski what would have happened had they pushed on with only five helicopters, Beckwith simply replied, “I wouldn’t be here today to tell you about it. It would have been a disaster.” To which Brzezinski answered, “That’s good enough for me.” Joint Task Force commander US Army Major General James Vaught, left, poses with Delta Force commander Colonel Charlie Beckwith, right, on the eve of Operation Eagle Claw., Public Domain All without getting caught The force had concentrated on contingency and “what if” drills for months.

Locations and paths approximate., Google Earth/Edward Chang Using the decision to abort in the desert as an inflection point, we can more accurately assess the chances of success in rescuing the hostages from Tehran. Given that decision came down to the flyability of one helicopter, we can proceed with the premise that, given a bit more industriousness and some luck, at least six helicopters could have continued with the mission and that Colonel Kyle’s judgment was correct – the flight control system would hold all the way to the mission’s next waypoint. But all the “guts” in the world would not have diminished the magnitude of the challenges that lay ahead for Eagle Claw. The mission was already running almost two hours behind schedule, due to the late arrival of the helicopters at Desert One . In a few hours, it would be daylight, drawing the risk of detection and possibly forcing an abort. The rescue force needed to get to its next staging point, fast. After Desert One , the plan called for the following: Fly two-and-a-half to three hours to an insertion point where the rescue team, composed of Delta Force operators, drivers, and interpreters, would be dropped off approximately 70 miles southeast of Tehran, hopefully, an hour before sunrise. The RH-53Ds would fly to a hiding site of their own 15 miles to the north, where they planned to spend the daylight hours tucked away in the hills near the city of Garmsar. The rescuers would be met by a team led by Richard Meadows, who would lead them five miles to a remote wadi that would be used as their hiding spot for the day. Meadows, a former Special Forces officer, had been called out of retirement to be secretly inserted, along with others, into Iran to gather intelligence for the operation and prepare transportation and hide sites for the rescue force. Their contributions would not only have made it easier to insert such a massive force so stealthily into Tehran, but their reconnaissance of the embassy grounds gave the mission a level of certainty it would have otherwise lacked. The rescue team would hide and rest throughout the day. In the evening, two of Meadows’ men would bring back to the hide-site a Datsun pick-up truck and a Volkswagen bus. One vehicle would take Colonel Beckwith to Tehran for a reconnaissance mission of the embassy to gather last-minute intelligence. The other would transport six designated drivers and six translators to pick up six covered Mercedes trucks that would transport the rescue team to the embassy. All of this would need to take place within a span of less than 24 hours, and without getting caught. It was this second phase of the operation that the risks taken became less calculated and more up to raw chance. In his comprehensive account of the hostage crisis from 2006, author Mark Bowden rattles off a list of “what-if” pitfalls that lay every step of the way. Examples included questions like, “What if the force was stumbled upon in its mountain hiding place outside Tehran on the mission’s second day, or stopped and attacked on its way into the city on that night?” Colonel Beckwith, as related in his memoir , had been concerned about the security of the hide-site. Meadows, who had staked out the location, assured him it was remote enough that secrecy was assured, assuming the helicopters took the prescribed course. There was, of course, no guarantee of this. At Desert One , the force had encountered a fuel truck and a bus driving along a nearby road upon landing. An Army Ranger, part of a contingent tasked with securing the area, attempted to destroy the truck with a shoulder-fired missile, but the driver survived and was picked up by another vehicle and escaped. The bus, meanwhile, was stopped with 45 occupants onboard. Beckwith, however, states that chance encounters were factored into the planning and the troops were ready for anything that happened. Therefore, these sorts of incidents were no reason on their own to abort the mission. Beckwith would later appear to have been justified in making such bets – no indications surfaced on the Iranian side that the truck that had escaped with two occupants ever reported their shocking desert encounter to the authorities. Colonel Kyle later estimated that “the clandestine nature of the mission could have been preserved for forty hours – sufficient time to complete the mission.” Delta Force, equipment in tow, waiting on the tarmac in Egypt before flying to Oman., Public Domain Still, at Desert One , the team had the luxury of turning around. Any further and it would have been exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to leave the country the way they had come, given the distances involved and the lack of a refueling point as they had on the way in. As a result, beyond Desert One was a point-of-no-return of sorts, If they were caught from there on, escape and evasion was the only option, something the Delta Force operators were exceptionally good at, albeit undesirable. The rescue team was prepared to do whatever it took to leave the country, with or without the hostages. The operators carried thousands of dollars in cash in Iranian currency, fake passports stamped with fake visas, documents providing key words and phrases in Farsi, had memorized escape routes, and were able and willing to steal or hot-wire cars and drive and shoot their way hundreds of miles out of the country to either Turkey or Afghanistan, the latter of which had recently been invaded by the Soviet Union. Hopefully, air support would be available from the carriers Nimitz and Coral Sea stationed in the Gulf of Oman or the AC-130 Spectre gunships attached to the operation; if not, the soldiers were not about to surrender or roll over and die just because the mission was compromised. At Joint Task Force headquarters in Wadi Kena, Egypt, communications would be monitored to detect any signs that the mission had been compromised, such as an increase in security at the embassy. This was also where the presence of Richard Meadows and his team inside Iran would have proven invaluable. They provided the operation the closest thing it had to real-time, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) of the target. Bringing Beckwith to survey the embassy prior to the assault would also confirm some key details and allow the Delta commander to more accurately assess the level of opposition they could expect. An aid to assist mission participants in saying useful words and key phrases in Farsi., DOD Satellite communications, or SATCOM, would be the primary means of communications throughout the operation, due to the distances involved, the remoteness of the situations the rescue team would encounter, and to provide a secure means of communications. SATCOM does have its drawbacks, such as requiring favorable environmental and geographic conditions to achieve a good connection. As real-life experience both en route to and at Desert One revealed, however, SATCOM proved problematic and it is likely it would have continued to be problematic throughout the mission as the team snuck deeper into Iran. Unreliable long-distance communications meant they would find it difficult to coordinate the operation with the other players involved and keep their chain-of-command in the loop. This potential lack of communication was a problem difficult to mitigate and could have upended the mission entirely, even if everything else went off without a hitch. Delta Force had little recourse but to hope conditions were favorable during the entirety of the one-day, two-night operation to facilitate SATCOM utilization. Extensively prepared as the mission was, a certain amount of luck was necessary to overcome each hurdle. Just reaching the hide-sites and remaining hidden throughout the day required vigilance and good fortune. The Eagle Claw team would have expended much of its allotment of the latter by this point. In our alternative history of the raid that never was, the sun was now setting on Iran on April 25, 1980, with Tehran and the embassy looming on the horizon. Could they actually pull this improbable mission off, or was their luck about to run out? Delta Force troopers. The one on the left is sporting AN/PVS-5 second-generation night-vision goggles., Public Domain Into the lion’s den The conferees were fully knowledgeable of the challenges ahead and the importance of the mission to the hostages and the United States. These were sobering thoughts but the group judged that their plan was feasible. They had been ready for several weeks but they were more ready than ever before. Their confidence was high. – Eagle Claw After-Action Report (Overall Assessment) Assuming Col. Beckwith was satisfied with the situation at the embassy, he would return to Delta Force’s hide-site at around 8:00 that night. By this time, the six trucks intended to carry the rescue team would have arrived, with the men and their equipment loaded aboard and hidden behind construction material and false walls installed inside the covered truck beds. At 8:30, the force, now composed of 120 men (down from 132 at Desert One , where aircrews and additional personnel primarily tasked to the refueling operation had been present), would depart the hide-site and motor up the road for the 70-mile drive northwest to Tehran. From here on out, the margin for error would narrow dramatically. There were two checkpoints along the route, located near the cities of Eyvanekey and Sherifabad. Hopefully, the Farsi-speaking translators would be able to convince the two guards at each site to allow them to pass without piquing suspicion. As before, however, the team was ready for anything – should the guards attempt to search the trucks, they would be seized, restrained, and carried along as cargo for the remainder of the ride or until they could be safely released without compromising the mission. Close-up of Night Two of the operation. Blue represents the path taken by the helicopters from the hide-site, to the embassy, then to the airfield at Manzariyeh. Green shows the general path taken by the rescue team to drive to the embassy. Locations and paths approximate., Google Earth/Edward Chang Though hardly ideal, getting past the checkpoints was not judged to be a particularly difficult part of the mission. The in-country clandestine agents who had spent months setting up the infrastructure and resources necessary for Eagle Claw’s success had driven along the road connecting Tehran and Desert Two numerous times and had apparently concluded these were obstacles the team could easily navigate. Furthermore, the reconnaissance mission Meadows and Beckwith would have gone on earlier in the evening ran the same route. If the checkpoints really were a problem, it would likely be known long before the rest of the force left their hide-site for Tehran. Once they got past the checkpoints, and Tehran drew closer, Beckwith would decide upon the specific route the vehicles would take to get to the embassy, depending on what the reconnaissance mission earlier in the evening had revealed. While sticking together was certainly preferable, the team was ready to split up to avoid drawing attention or take different routes to the embassy to avoid any obstacles that might have been spotted previously. Finally, the Volkswagen bus would now be transporting the 13-man team of Green Berets to the Foreign Ministry building, where three of the American hostages were being held away from the embassy. They would take an entirely different route from the others and were largely on their own for the duration of the rescue. The Green Berets were part of a Special Forces detachment assigned to the Berlin Brigade stationed in the American Sector of the divided German city. Meanwhile, a flurry of air activity would have already kicked off elsewhere in the region: From mission headquarters in Wadi Kena, a company-sized force of U.S. Army Rangers would take off aboard four MC-130E Combat Talons . They were tasked with landing at Manzariyeh Air Base, approximately 60 miles south of Tehran, and securing it as an extraction location. Four AC-130 Spectre gunships would depart Wadi Kena shortly after the Rangers left. The gunships would constitute Eagle Claw’s air support for most of the rescue portion. One was tasked with providing close air support (CAS) near the embassy, one would suppress Iranian Air Force activities at Mehrabad Air Base in Tehran, and a third would provide air support for the Rangers at Manzariyeh after it was seized. The fourth AC-130 would be a back-up. Two C-141 Starlifter cargo planes would leave Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, with plans to land at Manzariyeh 10 minutes after the airfield’s seizure. One Starlifter was configured as a medevac platform, while the other was configured with seats like that aboard airliners. The C-141s would be responsible for flying the rescue team and the hostages out of the country.

Air Force Major Lyn McIntosh, fourth from right, was one of the eight individuals who perished in the accident at Desert One ., USAF For the embassy assault, Delta Force had been partitioned into Red, Blue, and White elements. Their responsibilities were as follows: Red: Consisting of 40 troops, would secure the western part of the embassy compound, rescuing the hostages and neutralizing the guards located in an area that included the consulate, staff cottages, office buildings, and motor pool. Blue: Consisting of 40 troops, would secure the eastern part of the compound, which included the Deputy Chief of Mission’s residence, Ambassador’s house, and the chancery, which was the “main” building of the compound. White: Consisting of 13 troops, would secure Roosevelt Avenue to the east of the compound and the insertion point for the team. They would cover the withdrawal of the Red and Blue teams and the hostages as they moved to Amjadieh Stadium (currently known as Shahid Shiroudi Stadium ) slightly to the north and across the street from the embassy for extraction. During the rescue, White would cover the northern part of Roosevelt Ave. with an M60 machine gun and cover the south with an HK 21 machine gun. ‘A’ Squadron, Delta Force poses in front of an American flag, April 1980., DOD Timing was essential, but there was some flexibility built into the plan. To deal with any unforeseen events, obstacles, or changes to the tactical situation at the embassy, the plan permitted Colonel Beckwith to delay the assault for up to 40 minutes to reassess and wait for more favorable conditions to develop. Neither the seizure of Manzariyeh Air Base nor the arrival of the Spectre gunships would occur without Beckwith’s order. Assuming the rescue took place on-schedule, between 11:00 p.m. and midnight, a group of Delta operators would drive down Roosevelt Ave., east of the embassy compound, in the Datsun pick-up truck and, using silenced .22-caliber pistols, neutralize two guard posts and the guards walking along the street. Afterward, the trucks would arrive with the rest of the team. Using ladders, the troops would climb over the nine-foot wall surrounding the compound and drop into an area covered in trees. Red and Blue teams would get into position and await the signal to begin the assault. That signal constituted an explosion – the wall over which Delta Force climbed along Roosevelt would be blown open to create a convenient exit from the compound. After the explosion, the assault would commence and anyone inside the compound carrying a gun and not part of the rescue team would be killed as the hostages were rescued.

Hopefully, they would all start up after being shut down for almost an entire day. Once more, the helicopters would prove a decisive factor in the mission’s success. Any mechanical issues would pose potentially grave risks from this point forward, since mission success depended on the helicopters being operational from lift-off at the hide-site to landing at the stadium to extract Delta Force and the hostages to Manzariyeh for final extraction and any additional trips necessary between there and the embassy. Once the final delivery to Manzariyeh was made, the helicopters would be abandoned and destroyed, and the crews would depart aboard MC-130s. Rangers, including some riding in M151 jeeps and others on motorcycles, disembark from a C-130 during training for Operation Eagle Claw., US Army The mission plan underscores the importance of at least six helicopters remaining operational the entire mission. In theory, the operation could get away with just four for the rescue phase – one for carrying the hostages, one as a back-up for the first, and the last two for extracting Delta Force. However, as Beckwith states, this was predicated on the risk of one or two helicopters being downed at the stadium. If necessary, one or more helicopters could make multiple trips between the stadium and Manzariyeh – as was done at Desert One , fuel would be brought to the airfield, making the multiple trips possible, though the refueling evolutions would certainly consume precious time. In such a scenario where the hostages and the rescuers could not depart the stadium together, Delta would form a defensive perimeter around the stadium and, with some help from above, would hold out until their extraction aircraft finally arrived. Having helicopters shuttle back and forth from Manzariyeh and the stadium was undesirable, however. “We fervently hope we won’t have to do this. The risks are obvious,” U.S. Army Major General James Vaught, commander of the entire Joint Task Force assembled for the hostage rescue attempt, was quoted as saying by Colonel Beckwith in his memoir. Easy to forget was the 13-man team tasked with rescuing the hostages at the Foreign Ministry. Unlike the embassy force, the Green Berets were largely on their own, but, thankfully, they needed to secure just three hostages and had a good fix on their location. However, the Green Berets would need to be extracted via helicopter separately. Again, any less than six helicopters would jeopardize the lives of the rescuers and hostages immensely, since one helicopter would have to be available to stop at the Foreign Ministry to pick up the 13 soldiers and three hostages. Furthermore, if they ran into trouble at the Foreign Ministry, they would not have nearly 100 other soldiers to rely on for support. Again, assistance from the AC-130s would be vital here.

The street running perpendicular just east of the embassy compound was Roosevelt Ave., Google Earth/Edward Chang If, for any reason, extraction was not possible, then, as stated before, the entire force was prepared to escape and evade. If all went well, the rescuers and the hostages would be brought to Manzariyeh, where the Rangers hopefully would not have endured a nightmare of their own to secure. The rescuers and the hostages would be loaded aboard the C-141s and would be first to leave. The Rangers and the helicopter crews would leave aboard the MC-130s. The AC-130s and any other U.S. aircraft would follow suit and leave Iranian airspace and return to base. Hopefully, everyone would go home alive. Help from above The review group concludes that the concept of a small, clandestine operation was sound. A larger, overt attempt would probably have resulted in the death of the hostages before they could be reached. It offered the best chance of getting the hostages out alive and the least danger of starting a war with Iran. – The Holloway Report (IV. Conclusions) One of the sticking points of the operation, unresolved until just prior to Eagle Claw’s commencement, was the matter of air support. Without it, there was a low likelihood of the mission’s success. But sending U.S. warplanes into the skies of Iran was no simple matter. The country still had formidable defenses built up from the days of the Shah. The circumstances of the operation also meant the threat had to be met “as is” – there would be no air campaign intended to soften up Iranian defenses prior to the rescue. The Carter administration was understandably concerned with civilian casualties, but, without some big guns overhead to assist, even an elite contingent of warriors like Delta Force would not hold out for long in the face of fierce resistance. After all, they were neither equipped nor intended to sustain large engagements. Had the mission advanced far enough to affect the rescue, the AC-130s would be critical to success, holding off any hostile units attempting to interfere with the operation. It was hoped that their 105mm howitzers, 40mm Bofors cannons , and 20mm Vulcan cannons could handle any hostile forces that Delta could not handle and the AC-130’s presence would help ensure they and the hostages could not get pinned down with enemy fire. AC-130 Spectre gunship as seen through night-vision goggles., USAF “There was never any intention just to arbitrarily shell Teheran [sic],” said Beckwith. A predetermined alphanumeric grid system had been established to more clearly delineate targeting zones in case the AC-130s needed to deliver fire support, entirely on-demand. Consistent with President Carter’s directive to avoid as much collateral damage as possible, the gunships would neither “engage at will” nor fire directly at crowds unless specifically requested by those on the ground. It was hoped that merely firing near the crowds would generate a visual impact of spectacular firepower, which would dissuade hostiles from interfering with the operation, and that raining fire directly down on Iranian heads would prove unnecessary. Once the rescue team and the hostages moved to the stadium for extraction, the AC-130 would continue to provide air cover. In theory, attackers could be held off for quite some time with their assistance. The AC-130 responsible for targeting Mehrabad would focus on two American-built McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II fighters known to be on ready-alert. Again, the gunship would not fire at will; it would destroy the F-4s only if they appeared to be taxiing for take-off. Doing so would buy time for the mission and reduce the possibility of an air-to-air threat presenting itself during the operation. If needed, this Spectre gunship could move north towards the embassy and assist the other in covering Delta Force. Other targets designated for potential strikes, according to Colonel Kyle, included a ground-control radar north of Mehrabad used for controlling and vectoring Iran fighters, along with transport and tanker aircraft at the same air base. Finally, the gunship at Manziryeh would be the Rangers’ only heavy artillery as they captured the airfield. Once their work was done, the AC-130 could also proceed to Tehran and assist in the embassy rescue if needed. That left the matter of tactical air support provided by fast jets (TACAIR). During Eagle Claw planning sessions, Colonel Beckwith had been told he could count on fighter aircraft in the event something went wrong, with a caveat – due to the distances involved, TACAIR would take at least an hour to arrive on-scene. Declassified report discussing tactical air (TACAIR) support for the mission by warplanes from the USS Nimitz ., DOD “An hour to get on station was one hell of a long time,” Beckwith remarked in his memoir. “That was a hard bone to swallow.” In 1980, the U.S. military lacked the robust infrastructure in the Middle East necessary to host air assets in significant quantity. Therefore, TACAIR for Eagle Claw would be entirely aircraft carrier-borne, roaring off the flight decks of Nimitz and Coral Sea in the Gulf of Oman. Of the two, Nimitz possessed the more modern air wing and was tasked with providing the lion’s share of TACAIR during the mission. It was assigned two squadrons of the Grumman F-14A Tomcat fighter/interceptors, which had been in operational service for only six years at the time. The air wing was also equipped with one squadron of Grumman A-6E Intruder medium attack aircraft and two squadrons of LTV A-7E Corsair II light attack aircraft, both of which capable of flying close air support (CAS) missions. Coral Sea ‘s air wing also had A-6Es and A-7Es, as well as older F-4 Phantom IIs. An F-14A Tomcat of Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41), the “Black Aces,” assigned to the USS Nimitz , flying high above the Arabian Sea, 1980., Bill Lindner There was another problem. “There was also no TACAIR support tasked to follow us out of Manzariyeh,” recalled Beckwith. He had expressed his concerns to mission commander Major General James Vaught, fearing they would depart Manzariyeh, only to get shot down by an Iranian fighter. But, in the words of Beckwith, the problem never seemed to get resolved throughout the planning stages. Finally, President Carter settled the matter once and for all at a White House briefing on April 16. “There will be air cover from Manzariyeh all the way out of Iran,” Beckwith quoted the Commander-in-Chief as declaring. Ostensibly, carrier-based fighter aircraft would provide protection for the rescue team and hostages out of the country. It was a welcome relief for the special ops veteran. Flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz during its 1979-1980 deployment, which culminated in its participation in Operation Eagle Claw., USN While the hostage rescue mission was underway, it was planned to have two of Nimitz ’s F-14s, two A-6s, and a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker patrolling the North Persian Gulf. The F-14s were primarily tasked with protecting the tanker (and, later, escorting the transports out of Iran), while the A-6s were the designated CAS aircraft. Situation reports from the time indicate several airframes assigned to the Intruder squadron aboard Nimitz were equipped with the new Target Recognition and Attack Multisensor (TRAM) system, which provided the warplanes with, at the time, unprecedented night attack capability. The North Persian Gulf patrol station would be maintained throughout the operation with relief aircraft provided, as necessary. If Delta requested additional air support beyond what the AC-130s could provide, the A-6s would top-off their tanks and speed towards Tehran. According to the official mission after-action report, the Intruders would fly 375 nautical miles (431.5 miles) to Tehran, where they would remain on-station for up to two hours before returning to the Persian Gulf for fuel. It is difficult to say whether there was enough air support available to provide for all of Delta Force’s needs. Operational restrictions precluded the deployment of additional assets. Furthermore, American air-to-ground capabilities largely resembled that of the Vietnam War; a time when unguided munitions were predominant, and precision-strike had yet to become ubiquitous as it has become in the present day. Even while equipped with targeting aids such as low-light-level television (LLTV) and the TRAM system, the aircrews flying and operating the AC-130s and A-6s would rely almost entirely on Delta Force to provide them the proper verbal and visual guidance (such as smoke signals) necessary to provide accurate and timely air support. Likewise, the boots on the ground would rely on the training and experience of the aircrews to not only hit the target as they were supposed to, but to also avoid friendly fire. Still, not everything can be seen from the air, especially at night, and the mission’s outcome would ultimately come down to the performance of the men on the ground who had a seemingly insurmountable challenge to overcome. However, as will be seen in the next section, the rescue team did have some factors in their favor that would increase their chances of success. Declassified message suggesting ordnance loads for Navy F-14 Tomcats and A-6 Intruders supporting Eagle Claw., DOD Threat assessment The group believes it virtually impossible to precisely appraise the remaining part of the operation and to measure probability of success. During that portion of the mission, the inevitability of hostile reaction would have become a major factor. The dynamics inherent in a recovery of the type envisioned would have produced a level of complexity that makes the study of probabilities essentially a matter of conjecture. – Holloway Report (IV. Conclusions) One of the most intriguing questions regarding Operation Eagle Claw is the quantity and quality of resistance Delta Force would have encountered at the embassy. While it is easy to imagine a “ Black Hawk Down ” scenario, especially when picturing a virulently hostile city such as Tehran, the reality is that the Americans faced a more permissive environment than generally appreciated. According to the declassified Eagle Claw after-action report , the threat picture was summed up as follows: Intelligence regarding the status of the Iranian Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, and Pasdaran had not changed – if anything, conditions in the country had become more unstructured and chaotic and the capabilities of Iranian forces even less. Unless spotted directly by Pasdaran or a Gendarmerie post, the probability of getting to the [American Embassy] compound wall undetected was high. Iranians burn an effigy of Uncle Sam, representing America, with “CIA” printed on its right arm, in Tehran in 1979., AP Mission planners studied photographs and video footage from the nightly news of the embassy guards. In the eyes of Colonel Beckwith and his team, whether they were of the Pasdaran (Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard ) variety or the militant-type, the guards were amateurs, not professionals. They arrived at this conclusion by examining details such as how the guards handled their weapons and the types of weapons they toted. While many were armed with rifles, their arsenal appeared limited to small arms – no grenades were seen, for example. Equally important, the streets surrounding the embassy were busy during the day, indicating either an inability or unwillingness on the part of the guards to control crowds or command anyone else except themselves. This indicated that while the revolutionaries were certainly in charge at the embassy, they were not exactly in charge outside its walls, implying the Americans might not have to worry about an entire city turning against them, a la Mogadishu in October 1993. The Iranian people might not arrive en masse to aid the hostage-takers while the raid was underway. Or, the mob could show up and they would be as fearless and menacing as they appeared on television. This had been a major concern since the early days of the hostage crisis, when Major General Vaught expressed worry over the rescue team clashing with violent mobs, like the ones originally seen overrunning the embassy. This was a strong mitigating factor during the early stages of planning, one that could have prevented a mission from taking place. Intelligence reports from November and December 1979 indicated that local mobs could begin showing up at the embassy within 15 to 20 minutes of commencing the rescue, in addition to anywhere from 100 to 300 armed revolutionaries estimated to be capable of responding within the same timeframe. “Until we can find a way to get Delta into and out of the embassy without a massacre occurring in the streets, there will be no rescue attempt,” Colonel James Kyle recalled Major General Vaught as declaring. Declassified intelligence report detailing estimated response times of various hostile forces in Tehran., DOD By attacking in the dead of night, the threat of mobs swarming the rescue team was minimized. With adequate air support, it further decreased the likelihood a mob would get close enough to interfere with the rescue. In addition to attacking at night, doing so almost half a year after the embassy was initially seized, gave the rescuers a better chance of not only catching the guards in a vulnerable, less-focused state, but with a high degree of surprise. A daytime rescue was out of the question, but having a rescue take place so many months after the beginning of the crisis would inevitably create a sense of complacency or even fatigue in those guarding the hostages. It was reasonably expected that routines would be established by this point and the guards’ behavior would be more predictable, again lessening the risk of attempting a rescue. Finally, President Carter, who was running for re-election in 1980, was being roundly criticized in the media and by political opponents who felt he was gun-shy and unable to make the tough choice to launch a rescue attempt. This could have helped in making Eagle Claw a success, since it apparently convinced both Americans and Iranians that Carter would not dare send U.S. troops into the heart of Tehran. Declassified intelligence report detailing the disposition of hostiles at the embassy., DOD According to the after-action report, intelligence further indicated there were “up to 200 guards in the immediate area of the compound.” This seems to be a maximal estimate, however. According to Beckwith, their analysis told them to expect 70 to 125 potential hostiles on the compound. Between 20 to 25 guards were expected to be on duty while the rest were asleep, a seemingly reasonable expectation given the rescue would be taking place close to midnight. The building that intelligence indicated was housing the guards was to be covered with machine gunfire. Iranian reinforcements would have been mowed down as they exited their quarters to aid their comrades or pinned down inside. That left the on-duty guards as the greatest concern to Delta, but their mission would certainly be simpler with fewer armed hostiles to focus on. Finally, the after-action-report mentions: Perimeter security was at a low point just prior to mission launch. Several of the sandbag positions along the wall, for instance, were unoccupied and deteriorating. This critical bit of intelligence was likely gleaned through the observations of Richard Meadows and his team of secret agents inside Iran. These observations not only lend credence to the judgment that a sense of complacency and “crisis fatigue” had set in for the amateurish Iranian guards, but that the six-month delay in launching a rescue attempt could very well have paid off in terms of providing tactical advantages the elite warriors of Delta Force could easily exploit. This left the Iranian military, arguably the deadliest, yet the least-immediate threat to the Americans.  As the after-action report notes, the Iranian Revolution had thrown the nation’s military and security forces into disarray. The ranks of the military had been gutted, as the new government established under Ayatollah Khomeini sought to purge the leadership of anyone not on board with the revolution. As evidenced by the two former Iranian military officers advising Eagle Claw, the revolution had also led to defections among Iranian service members, not to mention executions of those who could not escape. Intelligence section of the Eagle Claw after-action report describing the level of opposition expected to be encountered during the mission., DOD Colonel Beckwith cited the presence of an armored cavalry unit stationed in Tehran as their greatest military threat. The Iranian Army, then and now, was armed with American-built M48 and M60 Patton and British-built Chieftain main battle tanks , along with Soviet-built BTR-60 wheeled armored personnel carriers and ZSU-23-4 “Shilka” anti-aircraft systems. The Shilkas worried Beckwith most. They posed a threat to both the helicopters and the men on the ground. Equipped with its own radar and four 23mm cannons, Delta and the hostages could be sitting ducks against such a weapon, to say nothing about shooting down the Sea Stallions as they arrived at the stadium. Elements of this armored cavalry unit were known to be stationed only blocks from the embassy. Analysis of various sources had led intelligence to conclude it would take 90 minutes for such a military formation to mobilize and respond to the situation at the embassy. Since the rescue was planned to take 45 minutes, there was plenty of time to secure the hostages and move to the stadium without needing to worry about an armored formation rolling down the street towards the embassy. Again, the AC-130s would prove instrumental in such a scenario, armed to deal with a threat such as armored vehicles. “The division leadership had been decimated by the Khomeini government,” Beckwith recounted. “When this fact was coupled with the unit’s known lack of spare parts and maintenance capability, the intel planners determined that it posed little threat to Delta.” Intelligence assessments at the time validate Beckwith’s analysis, with poor maintenance and low morale due to politicization of the military by the Revolutionary Guard being consistent problems across the services. If the element of surprise could be maintained and Delta Force did not run into serious problems at the embassy, then, with air support, the Iranian military could largely be a non-factor. The planners saw the National Police (known as the Shahrbani) as a more persistent threat than the military. Not only did they possess armored vehicles armed with .50-caliber machine guns or 76mm cannons, but they also exhibited greater loyalty to the new regime and the militants than the military. Intelligence was more limited regarding the police, so there was greater uncertainty regarding what to expect from them, other than that they would undoubtedly be the first responders to the situation at the embassy. Still, they were weaker than an armored force, so they presented a threat which Delta, with air support, could more easily manage. As for an air threat, there were the F-4 fighters at Mehrabad, the Shilkas, and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). But an AC-130 had Mehrabad covered and the F-4s would be blasted if they showed any signs of taking off. While Delta was worried about the prospect of confronting Shilkas, again, the delay in their mobilization and cover from the gunships considerably reduced that threat, and most of their anti-aircraft artillery were stored away. One last wrinkle – how would so many American military aircraft safely enter Iranian airspace, anyway? After all, even if the Iranian military as a whole were at a low state of readiness, they still retained some capacity to detect and defend against intruders. Electronic and signals intelligence gathered by U.S. forces in the region revealed a number of radars throughout the country were active, including the coastal installations, which could detect the C-130s and C-141s entering Iran east of the city of Abadan, close to the border with Iraq. Again, there was little choice but to take a chance, since no air campaign to neutralize Iranian air defenses could take place and the mission was nearly impossible without the involvement of the gunships and transports. If detected, a plan was put in place to transmit radio broadcasts in Farsi to confuse and distract the Iranians (who also flew C-130s) and buy time for the C-130s to get to where they needed to be. In an emergency, there were Navy F-14s, A-6s, and A-7s ready to assist. It was still a dangerous endeavor, however, and the aircrews of the C-130s and C-141s were taking a risk that would likely be considered unacceptable by military planners today. A KA-6D uses a buddy store to refuel an F-14A Tomcat with another F-14A flies alongside., USN Operation Eagle Claw also created the prospect of a seemingly inevitable clash between U.S. warplanes and that of Iran’s air force, made all the more intriguing by the fact the Islamic Republic operated many U.S.-built platforms and weapons, many of which had been delivered in the few years leading up to the revolution. The possibility that American F-14s and F-4s would encounter Iranian F-14s and F-4s might have been a fascinating match-up to contemplate for armchair warriors, but, for the pilots participating in the mission, it was yet another threat that would need to be addressed to ensure operational success. One measure taken was to paint special mission markings on the outer portion of the right wings of the aircraft from Nimitz and Coral Sea . Done primarily to help aircrews visually distinguish between U.S. and Iranian fighters from a distance, they also helped distinguish the aircraft by the squadron to which they were assigned. For example, Navy F-14s assigned to Fighter Squadron 41 (VF-41), the “Black Aces,” had a red marking in between black stripes, while Tomcats from its sister squadron VF-84, the “Jolly Rogers,” bore a yellow marking in between the black stripes. Furthermore, any aircraft deemed as needing to fly overland into Iran during the mission, primarily the fighter and attack planes, were similarly marked. A special black-red-black recognition marking is visible under the right wing of this F-14 assigned to VF-84., Bill Lindner An F-4 Phantom II fighter jet and an A-6E Intruder strike aircraft on the deck of USS Coral Sea . Both carry the black-red-black identification markings on their right wings., USN A-7Es on the deck of the USS Coral Sea wearing the black-red-black identification markings., USN Finally, Colonel Kyle described the SAM threat as “marginal” and “low-probability” since intelligence indicated the missiles were not loaded onto their launchers. Iran’s pre-revolution military did not have an extensive arsenal of SAMs beyond the American-built Hawks and British-built Rapiers . There were no man-portable air defense systems in their arsenal. Despite the likely probability that the Iranians would try to interfere with the extraction operation, intelligence also estimated the probability of enemy success as “extremely low,” so long as proper precautions, such as radio silence and low-altitude flying, were observed. With Iranian military response time calculated to be 90 minutes, it underscored the importance of quickly securing the hostages at the embassy. Known unknowns, unknown unknowns Rescue depended upon surprising the captors in the Embassy compound before the hostages could be harmed. If this surprise could not be achieved, the mission would fail – either canceled or aborted, with high probability of the hostages being removed or executed. – Holloway Report (IV. Conclusions) The success of Eagle Claw ultimately came down to two factors – preservation of the element of surprise and accurate, timely intelligence. Obviously, the mission would have been more difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish if the Iranians were aware the Americans were coming. Preserving the element of surprise, unfortunately, conflicted with the fact that a number of critical gambles would have to pay off along the way, so there would have also been a lot of hoping and praying that nobody in Iran would be alerted to Eagle Claw’s presence until the rescue actually commenced. There were, unquestionably, many locations where Delta Force could have been compromised – Desert One , the hide-sites, at the checkpoints on the way to Tehran, within Tehran itself, etc. Intelligence was another area in which the six-month delay between the embassy seizure and the rescue attempt worked to the rescue team’s benefit. Had an attempt been made earlier on in the crisis, Delta Force would have run into obstacles they would have not been able to prepare for. One of these were poles erected on the embassy grounds by the militants, ostensibly to obstruct any rescue attempt via helicopter. These poles were a big reason the stadium across the street was selected as the landing zone for the helicopters. If, however, it was determined on-scene that the poles could be removed, then a stadium landing would become unnecessary and the helicopters could land inside the embassy compound instead, making for easier extraction. Again, intelligence and planning permitted them to prepare for such a contingency. The U.S. Embassy in Tehran just days after its seizure., AP Another critical element of the rescue’s success was the location of the hostages within the compound. Consisting of several buildings, there was no concrete information on where exactly the hostages were. So much planning came down to educated guesses on that point. It appeared as though every single building might have to be searched for hostages. Then, on April 23, Delta Force caught a huge break. A cook, who had been working at the embassy throughout the crisis, had revealed to a CIA agent who just happened to sit next to him on a plane as he left the country, that most of the hostages were located in the chancery, including the exact rooms they were located in, along with the number of guards inside the chancery at night and where they were positioned. There were other hostages located in other buildings, but much fewer than anticipated. This information streamlined the assault plan considerably and the chancery would receive most of the attention at the outset, forcing Beckwith to make changes to the size of the assault elements. Still, it was all too good to be true, as Colonel Kyle noted. A cook, who had worked inside the embassy all this time, got on an airplane to fly home, and a CIA agent just happens to sit next to him, and he spills the beans? Something was not right. The mission commanders took advantage of the intelligence, but did so cautiously and were ready to shift gears if it all turned out to be a ruse. Years later, Steve Emerson, in his book Secret Warriors , explained that the cook story was, in fact, a ruse, but the information was not. It was obtained through a deep-cover CIA source in Iran who had gained access to the hostages. The cook story certainly makes sense in this context, as a cover to hide the fact the CIA did have assets deep within Iran, capable of gathering such valuable intelligence, at a time when it was widely-believed the U.S. had next to no sources on the ground. Furthermore, the information was consistent with what mission planners had surmised, minus the specifics. To this day, there exists little further detail regarding the information on the cook story aside from what mission participants and Steve Emerson described. It is worth noting, interestingly, that declassified documents related to the Iran hostage crisis suggest the U.S. either had sources on the ground or attempted to insert clandestine agents inside the country throughout 1980. If the information related in the cook story was true, it could very well have spelled success for the mission. A 45-minute rescue may have needed only 20 minutes to find and secure all the hostages. Finally, there was some concern as to how the hostages themselves would react to the rescue. It was feared some of the hostages, particularly the military service members, would attempt to overpower their guards and arm themselves with weapons. As mentioned earlier, however, Delta was planning on shooting anyone with a gun who did not arrive with the rescue team. It was very possible a hostage or two could be unintentionally killed in this fashion. It was a sobering thought, yet another coin-flip they would be forced to face, and the president accepted the risk. The guards were the most immediate threat to Delta and the hostages, and they had to be neutralized on the spot, without hesitation. No mercy would be shown. Every last Iranian on embassy grounds would be killed if that was what it took to ensure success. What could have been This rescue mission was the most difficult and challenging recorded in the annals of military operations. Few will fully appreciate the international, geophysical, astronomical, security and operation complexities associated with this operation. – Eagle Claw After-Action Report (Preface) Despite the rescue attempt’s real-life tragic end, the Carter administration never abandoned efforts at securing the release of the hostages. For its part, the military continued to develop additional rescue options under a new project code-name of Snowbird (the first and only rescue attempt was developed under Rice Bowl ). However, political, strategic, and operational changes that occurred in the wake of Desert One meant the window to rescue the hostages had likely passed once the April 24-25 mission ended in failure, making another rescue mission highly unlikely, unless the Iranians did something drastic like putting hostages on trial or killing them. President Jimmy Carter prepares to address the nation about the disaster at Desert One on April 25, 1980., AP This brings us to the question – was Operation Eagle Claw the proverbial Mission: Impossible— a task beyond the capabilities of even the world’s most powerful military? Or was it something within the realm of the feasible, just in need of luck and guile to achieve success? The answer will never be known, but the consequences of a successful mission would have been profound. Operation Eagle Claw has the feel of a Hollywood epic, one destined for a resounding and happy ending where the hostages and rescuers triumphantly return home and America receives a spiritual lift – if we can overcome this, we can overcome anything would have been the mantra of the moment. On that very high, the American people would enter the new decade having regained some of the optimism lost in the jungles of Vietnam. As the old rule of warfare goes, no plan ever survives first contact . It is hard to imagine the ball bouncing the way of the rescuers at every critical juncture of the mission. The haboobs and the mechanical failures aboard the helicopters, were all manifestations of Murphy’s law – what can go wrong, will go wrong. All the preparation in the world cannot reverse the likelihood that bad things can happen, since all military operations, even successful ones, constitute an exercise in risk management. But Eagle Claw needed so much to go right, with so little margin for error. Every step of the way was a gamble, however calculated, and the rescuers would just have to hope no deadly surprises lay in store for them. Even Delta Force commander Charlie Beckwith conceded, at the time, that the U.S. military “had neither the present resources nor the present capabilities” to pull the operation off. But, at least according to popular culture and the history books, it is precisely moments like these in which heroes are made. There exists a temptation to believe that the courage, ice-cold professionalism, phenomenal skill and training, and sheer willpower that are the hallmarks of an elite military unit such as Delta Force would have been enough to rescue those 52 hostages. Part of the mystique of special operations lies in the belief those who fight in the shadows possess some sort of “X-factor” that makes the impossible possible. Portrait of Delta Force, 1979. Jerry Boykin, who would later participate in the hunt for Pablo Escobar and serve as an Undersecretary of Defense, is top right. Eric Haney, who would later produce the popular CBS television show The Unit , is third row down, fourth from left., Public Domain Everyone involved understood the stakes and what they were fighting for. In terms of mission clarity, it was as simple and righteous as it gets: save our fellow countrymen and women and deliver them from the clutches of evil. They were not going into Iran to seize the oil or enact regime change and deliver democracy. They were going in to save people . Our people . The mission had been given considerable resources to facilitate success and every effort would be made to bring everyone home the same night the mission took place. President Carter, who has been roundly derided for his handling of the crisis, had largely left the operation to the military’s devices, trusting in their judgment and their skills, a fact that members of the rescue team, including Colonel Beckwith, have confirmed. “As far as I’m concerned, Colonel Beckwith has my approval to use whatever force he needs to save American lives,” Carter was quoted as saying. Yet all the force in the world may not have been enough. If Delta Force and the hostages had run into fierce resistance at the embassy, if they had been pinned down at the stadium, if a helicopter or two had been shot down, if the Green Berets at the Foreign Ministry ran into serious trouble, the entire complexion of the mission would have changed. The Carter administration would then face an even greater dilemma – does the U.S. unleash the full power of their military forces stationed in the region in an all-out effort to save the hostages and their rescuers? Or do they concede defeat, accept the humiliation, and try to negotiate the release of what is likely to be even more hostages? In textbook fashion, Eagle Claw was an ultimate high-risk, high-reward operation and it is difficult to imagine Americans not being killed. After all, many of history’s most successful hostage rescue operations saw both hostages and rescuers dying in the process. Even a relatively successful operation in Tehran could have amounted to a pyrrhic victory, in the end. On the other hand, if the hostages had been successfully rescued with minimal loss of life, it would have been a monumental military victory for the United States. Eagle Claw would come to possess a legend like that of other well-known long-distance hostage rescues, such as Israel’s Operation Entebbe in Uganda and the rescue of Lufthansa Flight 181 in Mogadishu, Somalia during the 1970s. Americans caught a further glimpse of what could have been less than two weeks later, as they witnessed the British Special Air Service (SAS) liberate, ironically enough, the Iranian embassy in London, from the clutches of Arab separatist militants. Like Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in the wake of the Japanese embassy rescue in 1997, President Carter’s political fortunes might have been reversed, possibly winning him re-election in November 1980 and denying Ronald Reagan the opportunity to become the transformational political figure he became. The Iran hostage crisis would not have become the lingering, open wound which it remains over 40 years later, clouding every interaction between Washington and Tehran. For better or for worse, the world would be a different place. Regardless, a successful Eagle Claw is fascinating to think about. The legacy of Eagle Claw The facts are that, in the conduct of this review, we have seen infinitely more to be proud of than to complain about. The American servicemen who participated in this mission—planner, crewman, or trooper—deserved to have a successful outcome. It was the ability, dedication, and enthusiasm of these people who made what everyone thought was an impossibility into what should have been a success. – Holloway Report (Forwarding Statement) The 40th anniversary of Operation Eagle Claw came and went with little fanfare. Though the memory of the Iran hostage crisis is seared in the minds of some and remains a topic of considerable controversy in certain circles, the rescue attempt has faded from the consciousness of the general public. For better or for worse, Eagle Claw possesses a different level of notoriety compared to, for example, the Black Hawk Down incident in Somalia in 1993. Perhaps this is due, in part, to the fact the Iran hostage crisis did have something of a happy ending. In 2004’s The Persian Puzzle , former CIA analyst and Middle East politico-military expert Kenneth Pollack put the crisis into perspective, stating the Carter administration’s strategy “ultimately ‘worked’ in the sense that all of the hostages came home alive. It is impossible to get around that fact.” Interior of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, present day., AP Any judgment of Eagle Claw must be rendered within this context. Political partisanship aside, any fair, objective appraisal of the mission must also acknowledge that not only did President Carter’s strategy deliver the desired results in the end, that strategy was, in the words of Pollack, “the only one that could have worked [emphasis original].” Unfortunately, it took 444 grueling, stressful days to reach the desired conclusion. The ordeal endured by the hostages was no trivial matter, either. These facts are not lost on observers like Pollack, who willingly concedes that it is certainly fair to ask if there was an alternative strategy that could have brought the hostages home sooner and permitted the U.S. to save some face on the international stage. But when faced with the choice between all 52 Americans returning home alive versus the loss of even a single hostage, talk of any alternative, particularly a more forceful response against Iran, loses momentum. Americans could have certainly done without the loss of eight troops in the Iranian desert and the accompanying demoralization and embarrassment that followed. However, even if Eagle Claw had succeeded, the Pentagon had still estimated the loss of 15 hostages and 30 soldiers. Given the risks the rescue mission entailed, the fact is, there was no further American loss of life associated with the crisis beyond April 25, 1980. To further argue the matter is to miss the point, which was to bring home the Americans held captive. When asked to reflect upon her ordeal in a CBS interview televised on April 25, 2020, Kathryn Koob summed it up aptly by saying, “It was fourteen-and-a-half months out of over 80 years. I had to let go.” Letting go, of course, is tough in any hardship or tragedy. For those who participated in Eagle Claw, there was a sense of disappointment and sadness that would linger for many years. But, it was an experience they did not face alone. For one, they had the backing of their Commander-in-Chief. Despite an attempt to apologize for the mission’s failure, President Carter refused to allow Colonel Beckwith nor Delta Force to shoulder the entire burden of the calamity. Beckwith quoted Carter as telling him, “I didn’t know we still had people like this, people who would sacrifice everything for their country. Colonel Beckwith, I am very proud of these men.” It was a story corroborated by the air component commander, Colonel James Kyle. “The President didn’t abandon the rescue team, nor did he point the finger of blame at anyone,” he recalled in his memoir years later. “He was showing the forces we would face the consequences together.” The manifestation of solidarity from the top down arguably helped those responsible for picking up the pieces do precisely that in the face of tremendous adversity. The hostages as they disembark a plane after being released. Kathryn Koob is in the middle., USAF Pick up the pieces, they did. From the ashes of Desert One rose a new era for special operations within the American military. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), along with its subordinate Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), was established in response to the perceived failures of Eagle Claw. For the first time in U.S. military history, special operations forces would be unified under a major command and be treated with the regard of a frontline, main-effort formation. Along with it would be incredible new advances in highly focused tactics and technologies that were specifically developed and procured to give special operators every advantage and to fill in glaring capability gaps, many of which were highlighted in the aftermath of Eagle Claw. Together, SOCOM and JSOC, for decades, have constituted the tip of the spear in the ongoing struggle against international terrorism. Equally significant was the long-overdue re-organization of the military command structure under the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. The Holloway Report had mentioned multiple issues concerning command-and-control and inter-service cooperation during Eagle Claw, serving as a final straw of sorts to simplify the way the military conducted business. Tragic as the outcome of Eagle Claw was, the release of all the hostages, combined with the transformation of the military in the wake of the disaster, ensured the sacrifices of the eight men who died at Desert One were not totally in vain. Furthermore, the mission’s premature tragic end, ironically, made it unnecessary to confront the exceeding dangers and uncertainties of the entire operation, perhaps sparing the hostages a worse fate, and certainly re-opening the door to a largely peaceful resolution to the crisis. Despite championing military action early in the crisis, even National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski later concluded, “It relieved public pressure for a large-scale military action against Iran, and thus permitted the resumption of our diplomatic efforts, reinforced by sanctions, to obtain the release of our people.” The disaster in the desert was costly in many ways, but, in retrospect, it might have been the price of ensuring all the hostages came home alive. Remember them not for how they died For the men we honor today, duty required both daring and quiet courage. They were willing to face the relentless desert and the angry mobs, if necessary, to free fellow Americans who can be accused of doing nothing more than their own duty in a hostile place. – President Jimmy Carter, Arlington National Cemetery, May 9, 1980 The eight men who lost their lives in the desert are buried at Arlington National Cemetery and elsewhere across America. On May 9, 1980, a memorial service was held at Arlington to eulogize the fallen and it was a moment never to be forgotten by those who were there. J.V.O. Weaver, an Air Force officer who participated in the mission, recalled how President Carter knelt and embraced two young boys who had lost a loved one at Desert One . “Tears were streaming down his cheeks,” Weaver told Airman Magazine in 2001. “Here’s the president of the United States, on his knees, crying, holding these boys. That burned right in there.” Colonel James Kyle reacted much the same, himself becoming overwhelmed with emotion, as he listened to the president pay tribute to the eight airmen who made the ultimate sacrifice. “It was an extremely moving ceremony,” Kyle remarked in his memoir. “I could not suppress the tears of grief any longer.” Together, they would all watch as military jets flew overhead in the missing man formation to memorialize the men who did not make it back. Like most events of great historical significance, such as the Kennedy assassination, 9/11, and the present-day COVID-19 epidemic, the Iran hostage crisis was endured by the nation as a whole. But, for the hostages and the servicemembers who participated in the rescue attempt, it was undeniably personal. The sacrifices of the eight men who perished, along with the efforts of all who took part in Operation Eagle Claw, hold deep meaning to the 52 hostages and their families despite its failure, a humbling and inspiring affirmation that there exists among us those willing to give everything for those whom they have never met, even at great risk to themselves. It is a legacy worth honoring – the bravery, courage, and selflessness exhibited on April 25, 1980, in the desert by those who embarked on a mission against all odds. Portraits of the fallen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The threat of losing major runway facilities throughout the Pacific Theater during even a limited conflict with a peer state competitor like China is becoming more urgent by the day for the U.S. military. The fact that even the sprawling Andersen Air Force Base on Guam is vulnerable to barrages of Chinese ballistic missiles , as well as other forms of attack, has pushed the Air Force to expand forward basing options on Wake Island and nearby Tinian Island . Now, Andersen’s jungle encircled Northwest Field airstrip, which, even after some improvements, remains quite austere, is going to see fighter jets come and go soon as part of the yearly multi-national Cope North airpower exercise that takes place primarily from Guam. Air Force Magazine’s Brian Everstine was the first to break the news that Andersen’s Northwest Field will host F-35s from Eielson Air Force Base and F-16s from Misawa Air Base. In the past, only C-130s and helicopters operated from the field, which has been lengthened recently, and did so infrequently. So, rapidly adapting it to accommodate far more fragile and infrastructure-dependent fighter aircraft is a huge and somewhat unprecedented task for the USAF. A September 2018 image shows the eastern runway extension at Northwest Field being reworked. , Google Earth Overall, the use of the austere airfield during Cope North will work to better hone what the Pentagon calls Agile Combat Employment tactics, in which deployments of various assets are far less predictable and more nimble in general, often leveraging small groups of aircraft operating from austere and other non-traditional locations . This concept of operations also increasingly leverages smaller ground support teams and includes building up austere bases to minimum operating requirements and then quickly moving on to another area so as to drastically complicate the enemy’s defensive and offensive plans. It also allows for greater survivability of the Agile Combat Employment package. There are some improvements being made to the 8,000-foot strip before the February exercise kicks off—namely the addition of an emergency arresting gear system . This is a critical piece of equipment for Air Force jets that experience emergencies and need help coming to a stop before running off the runway. They are not used to ‘trap’ Air Force jets as they can do with Marine and Navy fighters, including on short fields as an operational concept, but they can be used to shorten the landing roll of Air Force jets some operational instances. The USMC is looking to take more advantage of its carrier-capable F/A-18C/D and F-35C ‘s short-field capabilities for expeditionary operations. You can read all about this in this recent War Zone exclusive. An overview of the massive Andersen AFB and some of the ecological issues at play with the facility. , USAF Northwest Field is also home to a number of other assets and facilities, and some of them are quite high-security, including the THAAD missile battery that protects the island from low-volume ballistic missile barrages, as well as major satellite communications nodes. A couple of small support buildings have been built on the strip’s eastern end (seen in the banner satellite photo in this post, taken just days ago), but beyond that, there are no facilities there that are normally found at the bases these jets fly out of, including even basic hangars. For comparison, take a look at the F-35’s specially-built air combat fortress at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The strip is also encircled by extremely dense jungle that is patrolled by specialized jungle teams. As such, using it to execute some new basing tactics that leverage high-end air combat assets that are not at home in this type of environment is ambitious, to say the least. Northwest Field in the early 2000s, prior to rehabilitation. It is still quite austere though. , USAF This aspect of Cope North will see F-16C/D Vipers and F-35 Lightning IIs land, refuel, rearm, and fly out as if they were sustaining actual combat operations from the remote locale. This is challenging to do during high-tempo operations even at a fully outfitted base. Doing it at this remote airstrip, with no communications, motor pool, crash response forces, administration offices, life support shop, and so much more that goes into operating these advanced aircraft, will be far more so. Even getting fuel there, assuming they act as if it were a remote island base onto itself, will be a challenge. Expect to see MC-130 special operations aircraft refueling and providing rearming support for these jets on the ground as they have become more accustomed to doing as of late. Even wildlife can become a major operational issue that will have to be dealt with. An MC-130 acts as a forward arming and refueling point (FARP) for F-35As. These types of trials have accelerated in recent years and are now going to be put to the test in an integrated exercise. , USAF With all this in mind, the logistics of even attempting this drill is sure to provide a ton of lessons that can be used to refine what is becoming an increasingly necessary basing strategy. We will report on how this all works out when Cope North kicks off next month.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released images of an F-15E Strike Eagle carrying a live AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range cruise missile, or JASSM-ER . Strike Eagles are among the service’s most in-demand combat jets and are a leading delivery platform for the JASSM series of stealthy missiles. It is all be confirmed that F-15Es fired AGM-158s to level ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi’s compound in Syria following the raid that led to his death in 2019. The F-15E in the new pictures is assigned to the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron, part of the 57th Wing at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and launched the AGM-158B over the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico as part of a test on Jan. 7, 2021. Other active-duty personnel from the 57th Wing, as well as members of the Air Force Reserve’s 706th Fighter Squadron, which is associated with the wing, participated, as well. An F-15E Strike Eagle from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron loaded with an AGM-158B JASSM-ER during a recent test., USAF “From the operational test side that we do at Nellis, we had only seen it [JASSM] in training, we had never employed one off an operational test jet here,” Air Force Major Derek Anderson, the 706th Fighter Squadron’s Director of Operations, said after the test. “Even with this one sortie we will be able to provide valuable feedback to the software engineers of changes that we need to get incorporated.” Another view of the F-15E involved in the recent JASSM-ER test., USAF The Air Force did not specify what changes were made to the AGM-158B in this case, but said that the test was “intended to validate enhanced hardware and software that will improve the lethality of the F-15E and other delivery platforms.” The JASSM series is still relatively young, with the original AGM-158A variant entering service in 2009 and reaching initial operational capability on the F-15E in 2013. The extended-range AGM-158B variant arrived in 2014, but initially only on the B-1B bomber . Integration of this version on the Strike Eagle came later, with the aircraft only reaching full operational capability with this missile in 2018. B-2A and B-52H bombers and F-16C/D fighters can also carry these weapons. The U.S. Navy had originally planned to adopt these missiles, as well, but dropped out of the project. However, the JASSM has also been integrated onto the F/A-18 Hornet to satisfy requirements from foreign operators. A close up of the AGM-158B JASSM-ER under the F-15E Strike Eagle during the recent test., USAF To date, there are only two known instances of JASSMs being fired in anger, one of which, as already noted, was in the aftermath of the Baghdadi raid. Air Force B-1Bs also fired 19 of these missiles during the U.S.-led missile strikes on chemical weapon-related sites in Syria in 2018. Still, the JASSM family, which now includes a ship-killing derivative, the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), has steadily become one of the Air Force’s primary air-launched conventional stand-off weapons. In 2019, the service retired the AGM-86C/D Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM), the non-nuclear cousin of the AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), which only the B-52H had been able to carry. The service is now in the process of developing a JASSM variant, the “extreme range” AGM-158D JASSM-XR , which is expected to be able to hit targets more than 1,000 miles away. For comparison, the AGM-158B has a publicly stated range of at least 575 miles and the AGM-86C/D’s maximum range was said to be around 600 miles. Last year, the Air Force also conducted a series of tests around the possibility of giving B-1B bombers the ability to carry JASSMs , as well as other weapons , externally. With weapons like the JASSM family, including the future AGM-158D, the Air Force’s F-15Es, the first of which entered service in the late 1980s, look set to continue to be in-demand strike platforms for years to come. The service has also been adding other important upgrades to the Strike Eagles in recent years, including AN/APG-82 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and, now, new radar warning and electronic warfare suites. As it stands now, these aircraft remain heavily committed to supporting active conflicts in the Middle East, including ongoing operations in Iraq and Syria , flying primarily from Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan. Strike Eagles that deploy there now regularly sport very colorful nose art , something that has become something of a broader tradition for F-15Es, as well as F-15C/D Eagles , that get sent to bases across the region. You can find a video highlight reel of the 492nd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron’s deployment to Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in 2020 here . Nose art seen on an F-15E Strike Eagle assigned to the 492nd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron after returning from a deployment to Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan in 2020. The artwork features Marvel Comics supervillain Thanos, but rendered in a way that also references Turkish restaurateur and internet sensation Nusret Gökçe, better known by the nickname Salt Bae., USAF All told, as time goes on it seems likely that we will only be seeing more F-15Es carrying stealthy JASSM series missiles, abroad and at home.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 11, 2020",The United States Smuggled A Russian-Made Pantsir Air Defense System Out Of Libya: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military reportedly spirited a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense system out of Libya last year, after it was captured from forces aligned with rogue general Khalifa Haftar . The operation had the immediate ostensible aim of preventing the system from falling into the hands of any number of militant and terrorist groups in that country, but there would also be clear intelligence benefits from obtaining a largely intact example of this system, which Russia operates and has also exported widely. British newspaper The Times was first to report the covert mission, which it said took place in June 2020. A U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft is said to have flown to Zuwarah International Airport, situated to the west of Tripoli, to pick up the Pantsir-S1, which it then flew to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system that was captured from forces aligned with Khalifa Haftar at Al Watiya Air Base in May 2020. , via Twitter It’s not clear exactly what model of Pantsir-S1 was reportedly recovered. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) received a number of these systems by way of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which purchased a distinct version that uses German-made 8×8 MAN SX truck chassis. Pictures had also emerged last year reportedly showing examples of the standard Russian type, which uses an 8×8 KAMAZ-6560 truck chassis, and is also the primary export configuration, in service with the LNA. While the chassis are different, the core system is the same on both variants. The Pantsir-S1 includes a turret that can be loaded with up to six ready-to-fire 57E-series command-guided missiles and that also has two 30mm automatic cannons. Crews use the system’s integrated radar and long-range infrared tracking sensor to target aerial threats and the cannons can also be employed against ground targets. The missiles reportedly have a maximum range of around 20 miles and can hit targets at altitudes up to 50,000 feet, depending on the exact variant and the profile of the threat, but the system is primarily designed for low-altitude, close-in point defense. Namely, this includes swatting down cruise missiles, drones, tactical aircraft, and even air-to-ground munitions. The LNA, elements of which are seen in the video below, has its main hub in Tobruk in eastern Libya and enjoys the support of Russia , the UAE , Egypt , and others. It has been engaged in a civil conflict for years now with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). The main seat of the GNA, whose primary benefactor at present is Turkey , is in the internationally-recognized capital Tripoli, in the western portion of the country. There have been indications that shadowy mercenaries from the Russian private military company Wagner have been the ones operating all of these Pantsir-S1s. Wagner has strong links, if not direct connections to Russia’s Main Directorate military intelligence agency, also commonly known by the acronym GRU. Wagner mercenaries are also believed to be the ones piloting MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters and Su-24 Fencer combat jets that Russia sent to Libya to help bolster the LNA last year, which you can read more about in these past War Zone pieces . U.S. Africa Command also said in 2019 that an unspecified drone, possibly an MQ-9 Reaper , had been shot down near Tripoli by Russian-made air defenses that forces aligned with the LNA were operating at the time. The Times says that it is believed that that members of Wagner brought this unmanned aircraft down using a Pantsir-S1. The Times ‘ report did not say where exactly the Pantsir-S1 that was subsequently turned over to the U.S. military had been captured initially, but it said that GNA-aligned forces took possession of it “after an airbase was overrun in a counter-attack.” This would make it very possible, if not probable that the system in question was one of a number of UAE versions that were seized in good condition when the LNA was ejected from Al Watiya Air Base to the southwest of Tripoli in May 2020. At least eight Pantsir-S1s were reportedly destroyed or captured as Turkish-backed GNA forces routed the LNA and drove them eastward last year. https://youtube.com/watch?v=lp6KeIQ0XD0 https://youtube.com/watch?v=KcdcUqiDKB8 What may have happened to the Pantsir-S1 after it arrived at Ramstein is unclear. Using online flight tracking data, observers have determined what could very well be the C-17A that carried it there, which first left Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina for Ramstein just days after the GNA captured Al Watiya in May 2020. That aircraft subsequently made multiple trips to and from Libya, with at least one additional apparent stop in Turkey, in the first week of June. It then returned to Charleston on June 7, 2020. The immediate impetus for the U.S. military to remove the system from Libya was reportedly fears that it could fall into the wrong hands. Such fears certainly have merit. Various kinds of weapons, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), were smuggled out of Libya in the chaos that followed the ouster and killing of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Forces under the direction of GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha had already wrestled the Pantsir-S1 from the hands of Mohamed Bahroun, a GNA-aligned militia commander who also goes by the nomme du guerre “the Rat,” after Bahroun’s group initially captured it, according to The Times . It was then reportedly moved to a base hosting Turkish forces before being sent for pickup at Zuwarah. Bahroun has reported connections to arms smugglers and Islamist militant groups in Libya. Mohamed Bahroun, in the white shirt, seen taunting an LNA pilot, in the green flight suit, who was captured after bailing out of a MiG-23 combat jet near Tripoli in 2019., via almarsad.co At the same time, there would have been other ways to mitigate these concerns that would not have required recovering the Pantsir-S1, including destroying it, either on the ground or from the air. The potential intelligence value is more likely to have been the major driving factor for the U.S. military. “A Russian official said Moscow was aware the U.S. had removed the Pantsir system but suggested its capture would be of limited intelligence value, since the US would have the opportunity to study the same system in the UAE,” The Times added. “Export versions, such as the one captured in Libya, are supposedly stripped of a carefully guarded identification friend or foe database with the transponder codes for all Russian air force jets.” However, whatever the system’s capabilities, the UAE is unlikely to have ever allowed elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community that specialize in what is known as “ foreign materiel exploitation ,” or FME, to completely tear down any of its Pantsir-S1s. A full and meticulous examination of the system could still yield a wide array of valuable intelligence information. Even just examining the materials used to make certain components and the quality of their manufacture can provide useful insights into current Russian industrial capabilities. It’s not clear if the U.S. government has acquired any other Pantsir-S1s, which have been in service since 2012, from any other sources in the past. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pdmBBaTQ6q0 Having a largely complete and potentially functional Pantsir-S1 would also give the U.S. military a valuable example of a real-world threat system for use during testing, including when it comes to developing countermeasures. It could also help with the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures and would be a prized asset for use by the “opposing force,” or OPFOR, during major exercises , such as Red Flag and Black Flag . It’s true that the Pantsir has, at best, a mixed record, suffering particularly notable losses in Libya, as well as Syria, to Turkish , Turkish-backed, and Israeli forces . While some of this can be attributed to poor quality operators, major deficiencies with the first-generation Pantsir-S1s have also reportedly been discovered over the years, which has now led to the development of the improved Pantsir-SM and new surface-to-air missiles to go with it. Some of the system’s negative reputation is also based on superficial videos of them being struck by drones and other weapons. Without more complex anti-air tactics, any system is vulnerable to attack when it is left out in the open and offline for repairs, rearming and refueling, or due to personnel issues. Still, the Pantsir-S1 continues to enjoy significant success on the export market and presents a potential threat that U.S. forces are increasingly likely to encounter in future conflicts. https://youtube.com/watch?v=-2eErnb3Jpk With all this in mind, the U.S. government, among others , has long worked to acquire foreign threat representative systems, especially aircraft and air defense systems , on the open market and via other means for FME, testing, and training purposes. In one particularly famous example, U.S. special operations forces, including elements of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, snatched a Libyan Mi-25 Hind helicopter gunship from neighboring Chad in 1988. During the Cold War, the U.S. Air Force also set up an entire top-secret squadron, known as the Red Eagles , equipped with foreign jets that had been smuggled out of various countries or otherwise recovered, including some that had been partially destroyed, to test and train against. All told, no matter what might have ultimately happened to the Pantsir-S1 that the U.S. military reportedly picked up in Libya, it’s certain that intelligence analysts took all available opportunities to glean any additional information they could from it.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 24, 2021",The First Contractor-Operated F-16 Aggressor Jets Are Heading To North America,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first F-16 jet fighters to be flown by a private contractor offering red air adversary support are on their way to North America. It was confirmed today that a batch of the former Israeli Air Force jets was being transported from Israel to North America aboard a Ukrainian-registered An-124 cargo aircraft . Photos show at least three F-16s, with wings and tail surfaces removed, waiting to be loaded on the aircraft, with unconfirmed reports suggesting that four F-16s are being delivered. Once in North America, the fighters will join the Top Aces company, which will use them specifically to help fulfill the U.S. Air Force’s mammoth adversary air contract. As of January last year, Top Aces was reportedly still in the process of taking delivery of up to 29 single-seat F-16As from what was then an unknown source, with Jordan being identified at the time as one of the possible candidates. An F-16A Netz while still in Israeli Air Force service, at Nevatim Air Base., Gui Ashash/Israeli Air Force Then, last November, it was reported that Top Aces had chosen former Israeli F-16A/B jets — known in Hebrew as Netz — under a deal with the Israeli Ministry of Defense said to be worth around $100 million. Exactly how many jets are involved is unclear, but the company received approval to acquire up to 29, and in November 2019 the Top Aces confirmed it was seeking to acquire 12, although this could just be the first batch. Furthermore, those dozen jets were described as Block 15s, which are not a variant acquired by Israel, although the block number may also refer to the approximate standard to which the Israeli jets were upgraded while in service. Top Aces has long harbored an aspiration to acquire F-16s for red air use and, once they arrive in North America, the jets will be outfitted with open-architecture avionics making it possible to install different radar, sensors, electronic warfare pods, or other technologies as required. These modifications should ensure that the long-in-the-tooth F-16s are able to test pilots flying fifth-generation fighter jets like the F-22 and F-35. In regular use, the jets will be flown by the firm’s pilots comprising former Canadian, German, and U.S. military aviators, around 80 percent of whom are said to be graduates of the TOPGUN Fighter Weapons School . On its website, Top Aces provides the following information about the new addition to its inventory, which will join the subsonic Alpha Jet and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft already in use: As part of its future fleet, Top Aces intends to introduce the F-16 which is considered by many to be the most agile fighter aircraft of its generation. Its superior speed, acceleration, maneuverability, small visual and radar signature, and ability to integrate advanced sensors and threat systems have made it the aircraft of choice for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aggressor fleets since 1988. The Netz aircraft were originally delivered to Israel in the early 1980s and saw considerable combat action, including scoring the first air-to-air victory for the F-16, a Syrian helicopter downed with its cannon on April 28, 1981. The jets also executed the daring long-range daytime bombing raid on Saddam Hussein’s Osiris nuclear reactor near Baghdad on June 7, 1981. The last examples of the Netz in Israeli service were finally withdrawn in 2016 , a total of 40 then being put up for sale. The Israeli Air Force fleet now comprises the more advanced F-16C/D Barak as well as the F-16I Sufa that is optimized for long-range strike missions . A retired F-16A Netz now preserved as an instructional airframe at Hatzerim Air Base., Mor Tzidon/Israeli Air Force The background to the significant expansion of the Top Aces aggressor fleet is the U.S. Air Force’s red air adversary support program, in which the Canadian contractor was one of seven different companies hired to help U.S. military combat jet pilots train at various bases across the United States. This massive multi-billion dollar contract announced in October 2019 is the culmination of a major effort within the service that has been years in the making to increasingly rely on contractors to provide these services in order to improve flexibility for training requirements and to save money. The Air Combat Command contract is capped at no more than $6.4 billion, but it is unclear how much each company stands to make under their respective deals, which will cover work through 2024. Concept artwork from the company indicating how the contractor-operated F-16s might look., Top Aces Last summer, details emerged of the first five bases to receive the contract aggressor support, covering Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, although Top Aces was not among the initial round of contract awardees. In a tweet today, the Canadian company announced that its F-16s will be based at Mesa, Arizona, home to its F-16 Center of Excellence. Not only is this close to the company’s U.S. headquarters, but offers a useful central location, good weather, and access to local aerospace industry expertise. “The F-16 really is our growth platform for the future, especially for advanced adversary training,” Paul Bouchard, president and chief executive officer of Top Aces told Skies magazine in a November 2019 interview . “It is the most prolific adversary aircraft in the western world. It is the adversary aircraft of choice just because of its performance characteristics. It is a fourth-generation aircraft, so from an aircraft architecture standpoint, it can be equipped and configured in so many different ways… And it is also scalable given there were more than 4,000 F-16s built. It is still a production aircraft. It has a lot of existing support in terms of sustainment.” Although Top Aces is the first commercial red air enterprise to operate the F-16, the powerful and agile fighter has a proven track record in the role, serving with the U.S. Air Force and Navy , as well as fulfilling a similar role with Israel’s dedicated aggressor unit, 115 “Flying Dragon” Squadron, which you can see in action in the video below: While offering the potential to provide a potent red air capability, there remains a question about the overall state of these ex-Israeli airframes. It would be expected that Top Aces would select those airframes in the best condition, but the Netz fleet is still 40 years old and it saw considerable operational use. Providing the jets can be brought into service without too much difficulty, there is also the matter of what kinds of contracts these aircraft will fulfill. Regardless of their age, the F-16s are fourth-generation aircraft, the first of their kind to be offered by a red air contractor. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, has long called for more capable adversary aircraft , and in greater numbers, to adequately represent peer and near-peer threats, which would seem to open up a niche for the privately operated F-16s. On the other hand, this will have to be weighed up against the cost of operating such a relatively sophisticated asset. In the past, it is notable that the F-16 lost out to the F-5 in a multi-million-dollar U.S. Navy red air contract award. You can read all about how that deal played out here , but it is with recalling what The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway wrote at the time: The reality is that the F-5 is nothing near to an F-16 when it comes to many aspects of air combat capability. But for beyond-visual-range applications, aside from a larger radar aperture, an F-5 equipped with a modern radar offers one hell of a bang for the buck without losing all that much in terms of what the enemy looks like to the fleet aviator training against it. The F-5’s small size, both in terms of radar cross-section and especially its visual signature, also gives it something of an advantage over the F-16 for this specific mission set. But there is no doubt, the F-16 is a far superior platform that possesses a whole other level of kinematic performance over the F-5, especially in the within-visual-range fight. That being said, those facts just didn’t provide enough of an edge to make it worth paying over double the price for the same basic services. Of course, Top Aces isn’t the only one to have made plans to acquire additional combat jets in preparation to meet the requirements of the U.S. Air Force contract. Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC) and Draken have both purchased second-hand fleets of French-made Mirage F1s, while the latter company bought an additional number of ex-South African Cheetahs , a Mirage III derivative. TacAir bought a group of former Royal Jordanian Air Force F-5E Tiger II jets, which it then upgraded into its F-5AT Advanced Tiger configuration. Finally, Air USA is in the process of acquiring up to 46 soon-to-be-retired F/A-18A/B Hornets from the Royal Australian Air Force. While it has been a long time coming, Top Aces’ acquisition of as many as 29 F-16s puts it in a unique position within the contractor adversary community, although there are potentially more second-hand Vipers out there that could also find commercial buyers. As it is, Top Aces is set to be the first private aggressor force in North America to receive supersonic, fourth-generation fighters, and we will be sure to report on the next developments for the company’s new jets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 17, 2021",Army Eyes Unmanned Launcher Trucks Able To Fire Missiles Loaded With Swarming Munitions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is interested in the idea of a fleet of unmanned trucks carrying launchers based on the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System , or HIMARS, that would be capable of firing the now-in-development Precision Strike Missile , or PrSMs, and other future long-range surface-to-surface missiles. The service also wants to explore proposals for loading those PrSMs, and other missiles, with submunitions that can work together as a networked swarm. The Aviation and Missile Technology Consortium (AMTC) outlined the Army’s interest in these concepts in a call for white papers earlier this month . AMTC is a quasi-public entity that operates through the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Aviation and Missile Center with a focus on using smaller, non-traditional contracts to rapidly explore and even prototype novel aviation and missile technologies. A High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher fires a 227mm practice rocket. The Army is interested in an unmanned derivative of this system to fire various future longer-range missiles., US Army Of the 19 areas of interest that AMTC outlined in its January 2021 contracting notice, “Unmanned Launcher Prototypes for LRPF [ Long Range Precision Fires ] Missiles” and “Maneuvering Submunition Prototypes for LRPF Missiles” are particularly interesting. “The Government is seeking proposals for the development of an unmanned launcher prototype for Long Range Precision Fires missile systems to include larger missiles than the current MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM),” AMTC’s notice says. “Next generation launcher prototypes must be unmanned, highly mobile, C-130 transportable, cab-less, HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] chassis-based, and capable of supervised-autonomy and remote operation while being compatible with existing LRPF missiles.” It’s not clear what is meant here by “existing LRPF missiles.” At present, the only weapon the Army fields in this category is the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), a relatively small ballistic missile with a maximum range of around 190 miles. A HIMARS launcher fires an ATACMS missile., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin is now in the process of developing the PrSM for the Army, which was originally set to have a maximum range of around 310 miles. This reflected a range limit imposed by the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, between the United States and Russia, which collapsed in 2019. There are plans for a test later this year to demonstrate the ability of this weapon, which is presently scheduled to begin entering service in 2023, to hit targets at distances well beyond 310 miles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=uv8OVCcLlp4 The Army is also looking at future anti-ship derivative of the PrSM, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM), which would feature a multi-mode guidance system that would enable it to hit moving ships. The service is also looking to acquire land-based versions of the U.S. Navy’s Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile and SM-6 surface-to-air missile , the latter of which also has surface-to-surface capabilities , as part of its LRPF efforts. While ground-launched Tomahawks and SM-6s will require larger launchers, the PrSM is already intended to be fired from existing launcher vehicles designed to fire ATACMS, as well as shorter-range 227mm guided artillery rockets , including the M142 HIMARS that is the stated desired starting point for the proposed unmanned launcher vehicles for the Army. The M142 uses a 6×6 Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) truck chassis and has proven to be a capable design that has seen significant combat action with U.S. forces, including in Iraq, Syria , and Afghanistan . “The unmanned launcher must contain a lightweight turret capable of elevating and launching larger missiles while maintaining compatibility with legacy MFOM,” the AMTC contracting notice adds “Unmanned operation requires leader-follower autonomy, drive-by-wire, and remote launcher turret and fire control operation.” A semi-autonomous version of the M142 loaded with PrSMs could help expand the capabilities and flexibility of future Army missile units without the need for significant additional personnel. With the features AMTC has outlined, a relatively small team could potentially lead multiple launch units to a designated launch site, fire a volley of missiles, and then be more readily able to reposition to a new location, both to avoid counter attacks or get in range of new targets, if necessary. Unmanned launch vehicles could make it easier to rapidly distribute them across a broader area to reduce their vulnerability, to begin with. It’s interesting to note that the Marine Corps, which is in the midst of a major overhaul of its force structure , with particular emphasis on distributed operations and long-range ground-launched missile capabilities, is also exploring an unmanned land-based missile launcher as part of its Remotely Operated Ground Unit Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires) program. The proposed ROGUE Fires launch vehicle is based on the 4×4 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), making it smaller than what the Army is interested in, but it is still expected to use an actual launcher assembly derived from the one found on HIMARS. Semi-hidden in back of Oshkosh Defense booth at Modern Day Marine is first ever concept art of JLTV ROGUE Fires, emerging USMC tech study to place HIMARS on JLTV @ShephardNews pic.twitter.com/XrmSewA45o — Scott Gourley (@ScottGourley1) September 26, 2018 The AMTC notice makes clear that the Army is interested in PrSMs or other future long-range missiles it develops as part of its over-arching LRPF initiative being able to release groups of submunitions that can then work together as networked swarms. The submunitions could have the ability to operate as loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones , after being ejected from the larger missile, as well. “Modular payloads should be demonstrated to collaboratively detect, target, and strike high payoff targets that are moving, have moved, are poorly located, or are dispersed,” the call for white papers explains. “The concept must be a hardened deployable payload airframe and include a dispense [sic] mechanization compatible with long range fires delivery systems such as Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). The payloads must be autonomous and capable of collaboratively detecting, targeting, and striking and will need to be integrated into PrSM for a flight demonstration.” The obvious benefit here would be the ability to rapidly launch swarms of munitions deep into hostile territory where enemy forces are known to be, generally, but where their exact positions are unknown. The swarm could then rapidly search across a relatively broad area for those targets autonomously, engaging them as they are discovered. By this same mechanism, an area could potentially be denied to an enemy through the rapid deployment of precision-guided submunitions that could then loiter for some amount of time, waiting for potential threats to pop up. Swarms inherently have the ability to confuse and overwhelm enemy air defenses, as well. This could transform a PrSM or other missile loaded with swarming submunitions into a valuable ground-launched tool for suppressing or destroying enemy air defenses, missions commonly abbreviated as SEAD and DEAD. Certain submunitions might also be able to carry electronic warfare jammers , allowing the entire swarm to carry out a multi-faceted attack. The Army has already been exploring more broadly how artillery and missile systems on the ground could help clear a path for friendly aircraft in future operations, including using targeting information from aerial and other offboard platforms. Since at least 2018, the Army has actively investigating ways to deploy loitering munitions, potentially with swarming capabilities, at extended ranges, in general. This includes the Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile (SMAM) program, which the service has described as “an emerging precision loitering missile capable of engaging enemy tanks and other high-value targets out to 35 kilometers [~22 miles] or farther.” There is also the Missile Multiple Simultaneous Engagement Technologies (MSET) effort, “a suite of technologies providing the capability to rapidly defeat swarming and dispersed threats, providing simultaneous multiple launch, control and supervised autonomous terminal engagement of multiple missiles against various targets.” Both of these projects focused on individually-launched munitions, rather than submunitions that could go into a larger missile, though. An Army graphic showing notional Single Multi-Mission Attack Missiles (SMAM), which could be launched from vehicles, ships, or aircraft., US Army A graphic offering a brief overview of the Missile Multiple Simultaneous Engagement Technologies (MSET) project., US Army The Army is also in the process of developing a family of air-launched vehicles with swarming capabilities, to include possible loitering munitions, as part of its Air Launch Effects (ALE) program, which you can read more about in detail in this past War Zone piece . The service has also been experimenting with a concept involving a hypersonic missile capable of deploying loitering munitions at extended ranges, dubbed Vintage Racer , as well as exploring the idea of deploying swarms and other payloads via high-altitude balloons . Earlier this month, the Air Force also demonstrated a new air-launched swarming munition capability as part of its Golden Horde program . All of this, of course, follows on from years of work across the U.S. military on networked swarms of small drones, including tests by the Air Force and the Navy between 2014 and 2016 of air-launched Perdix miniature unmanned aircraft . All of this is part of an over-arching effort by the Army to develop tiers of longer-range strike capabilities that are heavily networked together and can rapidly prosecute a variety of targets across a broad area. This larger vision also includes work on new medium-range ballistic missiles , hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , superguns capable of engaging targets out to distances of 1,000 miles , and electromagnetic railguns . An “operational view” the US Army included in a briefing in 2018 showing how various future longer-range strike and more traditional artillery systems would operate together on the battlefield., US Army The Army is now eying adding unmanned launchers firing missiles loaded with swarms of submunitions to its planned mix of future advanced long-range weaponry.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 6, 2020",B-52s Return To The Middle East In Show Of Force As Biden Weighs Iran Policy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the first time since President Joe Biden took office, U.S. Air Force B-52H bombers have performed a ‘show of force’ mission over the Persian Gulf, reinforcing the fact the U.S. military remains on a heightened state of alert as regards Iran. The sortie, which took place yesterday, comes as the new U.S. administration works out how it will handle Iran after a months-long tense standoff with the previous Trump Administration, and it continues the long-range deterrence missions aimed at Tehran that started back in November. The two B-52s from the 2nd Bomb Wing departed Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, flew over Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, passed over the Persian Gulf near Qatar, then returned to Barksdale nonstop. The Pentagon has publically stated in the past that these types of missions are a means of deterring possible Iranian aggression, as well as signaling support to U.S. allies in the region. U.S. Air Force B-52Hs prepare to take off from Barksdale Air Force Base during the latest bomber task force mission over the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, January 26, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Jacob B. Wrightsman For parts of the sortie, the bombers were accompanied by fighter jets from the Royal Jordanian and Royal Saudi Air Forces, as well as by fighters from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz . That supercarrier had been set to begin making its way home last year, but the Pentagon subsequently sent it back to the Middle East amid threats from the regime in Tehran over the U.S. military’s killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani last year, including some directed specifically at then-President Donald Trump .

A B-52H assigned to the 5th Bomb Wing during a previous mission over the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, January 17, 2021., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Aaron Larue Guerrisky The last two such missions took place on January 8 and January 17 during a period in which there were acute fears that Iran might launch some kind of ‘revenge’ attack to mark the first anniversary of the U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020 that killed General Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Force. Threats against the United States, and former President Trump, have continued since then, including one only last week in which Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on social media a highly suggestive image of a drone targeting the former president on a golf course. Aside from the assassination of General Soleimani, relations between Iran and the United States have been severely strained ever since Trump’s 2018 decision to walk away from the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions . Since then, sanctions reimposed by Washington have had a significant effect on the Iranian economy and have in turn been used by the Iranian regime to attempt to mobilize hostility toward the United States. An Iranian underground Iranian ballistic missile facility was revealed for the first time last November., IMA MEDIA SCREENCAP However, Biden is in the process of recalibrating Washington’s approach to Tehran and has said that the United States could rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran resumes strict compliance. Iran, meanwhile, has called for Biden to “choose a better path” by returning to the 2015 nuclear deal but said it would refuse to cooperate with any further concessions that might be demanded of it. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that Biden “can begin by removing all sanctions imposed since Trump assumed office and seek to re-enter and abide by the 2015 nuclear deal without altering its painstakingly negotiated terms.” A @usairforce KC-10 Extender aircrew from the 908th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron conducts in-flight refueling to a B-52 Stratofortress over the @CENTCOM area of responsibility. @USAFCENT @US_Stratcom @AFGlobalStrike #TogetherWeDeliver @380AEW #NKAWTG pic.twitter.com/dB2bxZAFJ4 — USTRANSCOM (@US_TRANSCOM) January 24, 2021 It is worth noting that the Israeli government, for its part, which had cultivated close ties to Trump and was a prominent supporter of his policies toward Iran, is strongly opposed to the United States returning to the Iran deal. As a backdrop to this potential stumbling block are the repeated indications that Israel itself may be planning to launch some kind of strike against Iran , most likely directed at its nuclear facilities. Israeli policy toward Tehran has included recent strikes against Iranian-sponsored groups in Syria, as well as the apparent assassination of top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last November. This attack, which reportedly made use of a gun in either a remote-controlled or entirely automated mount on a pickup truck, is discussed in more detail here . In what may have been another show of force directed by Israel against Iran, imagery appeared on social media earlier this week showing Israeli Air Force F-35I stealth fighter jets over southern Lebanon and Beirut, where the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group maintains a significant presence. Reports in the Israeli media suggested that the mission was a deliberate signal to Hezbollah and in turn Iran, of Israel’s air superiority. בלבנון הצליחו לצלם מטוסי חמקן F-35I של חיל האוויר @IAFsite כשהם טסים בשמי המדינה. עד כמה שאני זוכר לפחות, זה פעם ראשונה שהם מצליחים לתעד חמקנים. מדובר בטיסות שגרתיות ועד היום תועדו שם מטוסים כמו F-15, F-16 וכטב""מים pic.twitter.com/EHrxMoRXzd — Shai Levy (שי לוי) (@shailevy6) January 25, 2021 At the same time, Iranian saber-rattling seems to have extended to its regional rival Saudi Arabia, too. Tehran has been a consistent backer of the Houthi rebel group in Yemen, likely including assistance for the group’s activities directed against Saudi Arabia, which have included attacks using ballistic missiles , anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles, as well as remote-controlled suicide boats and suicide drones . These have mainly targeted Saudi civilian airports and oil infrastructure but have also reached the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh. Most recently, the blame for an explosion in Riyadh yesterday fell upon the Houthis, although the group did not acknowledge responsibility for the apparent rocket attack. Imagery from social media apparently showed a missile being intercepted over the city by a Saudi Arabian Patriot air defense system . #Today #Iranian regim missiles smashed in the skies of Riyadh, #Saudi #Arabia by the #Patriot system pic.twitter.com/VARpBUzokD — Kawa (@Kaveh03004205) January 26, 2021 While Houthi attacks against Saudi Arabia have apparently continued, so far, there has not been any sign of an Iranian reprisal against U.S. interests in the region, or elsewhere. However, the threat posed by Iran in Saudi Arabia, in particular, is driving the U.S. military to look at options for alternative bases in that country . Earlier this week it was confirmed that the U.S. Department of Defense is examining the possibility of using a Red Sea port in Saudi Arabia as well as an additional two airfields in the kingdom. Currently, around 2,500 U.S. troops plus rotational deployments of fighter jets , and Patriot missile batteries are stationed at Prince Sultan Air Base southeast of Riyadh. However, the fact that the Trump policy of B-52 ‘show of force’ missions to the region is continuing under Biden, at least for the time being, suggests that the U.S. is still keen to demonstrate its resolve to Iran, while the new administration figures out its longer-term aims in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 26, 2021",Putin Reveals Existence Of New Nuclear Command Bunker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Kremlin has released an unusual transcript of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior defense and other government officials, as well as representatives of Russia’s defense industries, regarding the modernization of the country’s nuclear command and control infrastructure . In it, among other things, Putin disclosed that work on a new hardened strategic command post, possibly a deeply buried underground bunker, is nearing completion. Putin held the meeting in Sochi on Nov. 11, 2020. Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and Russian Army General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the country’s military, were also in attendance, among others. The day before, the Russian President had held another meeting, which touched on the country’s general nuclear deterrence policy, where he indicated that he would only authorize a nuclear strike in response to one against Russia. This apparent declaration of a so-called “no first use” policy would seem to conflict with previous official statements in recent years. “It is absolutely clear that the combat capability of the nuclear triad, and the capability of the army and navy on the whole to adequately and quickly respond to potential military challenges directly depend on the stability, effectiveness and reliability of these systems under any circumstances,” Putin said at the Nov. 11 gathering. “I would like to point out that a great deal has been done during the past few years to maintain all the command elements of our strategic nuclear forces at the highest possible level.” An official picture from the Nov. 11, 2020 meeting in Sochi, with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the head of the table., The Kremlin The Russian President made note of improvements to multiple “stationary and mobile command posts” in use across the country. The “analytical and operational capabilities have been expanded, including in terms of information support, monitoring and situation analysis” he explained, adding that “all command posts can receive comprehensive updates in real-time and use them to assess the situation and make substantiated decisions.” “All equipment, hardware and communication systems of the nuclear forces control systems are regularly upgraded yet remain as simple and reliable as a Kalashnikov rifle,” he continued, making a reference to Mikhail Kalashnikov’s iconic AK-47 assault rifle , famous for its reliability under the toughest conditions, and its subsequent variants and derivatives. However, Putin outlined further steps that he felt should be taken to make sure that Russia’s nuclear command and control architecture remains intact, “even in the event of a nuclear strike,” thus ensuring the country could launch a retaliatory strike, if necessary. The ability to carry out this kind of a second strike under any circumstances, even after a surprise attack, is a core underpinning of deterrence theory . The Russian president highlighted three specific areas of interest. One was the need for continued constant exercises and other events to make sure command and control systems are working as intended and that the people trusted with running them know how to properly operate them. Putin also called for efforts to modernize the country’s nuclear command and control architecture. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pk5hG5BT1Ek https://youtube.com/watch?v=r-YKGlwsoT4 Most notably, he emphasized a need to ensure the survivability of the country’s nuclear command and control infrastructure. “We are aware that a lot depends on the survivability of these systems and their ability to continue operating in a combat environment,” he said. “They have told me that the creation of an absolutely secure facility for controlling strategic nuclear forces, among others. is nearing completion, and that it will have a very high safety margin.” It’s not completely clear from these comments whether Putin was talking about an entirely new facility or the refurbishment, improvement, and/or expansion of an existing one. His remarks about the need to protect the overall command and control infrastructure against any threats, including a nuclear attack, strongly point to the site he’s talking about being deeply buried underground bunker of some kind. Russia already understood to have two sites that would match this general description, one at Kosvinsky Kamen in the Northern Ural Mountains and another under Mount Yamantau in the Southern Ural Mountains. The construction of both sites reportedly began in the late 1970s. It’s worth noting that no facility on earth is totally survivable in the face of strikes by modern nuclear weapons, but deeply buried sites offer probably the best possible defense. As such, the Soviets and the United States both, among others , invested heavily in such bunker complexes during the Cold War, as you can read about more in this past War Zone feature . Kosvinsky Kamen as seen from afar., Наумов Андрей via Wikimedia Kosvinsky Kamen, at least some portions of which are believed to be buried under around 1,000 feet of solid granite, is probably the better known of the two, due to its connection to a semi-automated nuclear command and control system first developed under the Soviet Union called Perimeter. This system was long described as a “dead hand” doomsday machine akin to the fictional one in Stanley Kubrick’s famous Cold War black comedy film Dr. Strangelove that could carry out an entirely automatic retaliatory launch of Russian nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) after an attack. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozg7gEchjuM More recent reporting has indicated that actual humans, who could be pre-authorized in a crisis to launch nuclear strikes if certain conditions were met, were still very much involved in the operation of Perimeter and operated its central components from within the Kosvinsky Kamen complex. That being said, reports still indicate that this main Perimeter bunker was like something you’d find in a villain’s lair in a James Bond movie. Its main control system was, at least “briefly” situated in “a deep hardened underground bunker in the shape of a sphere, very deep and very hardened, probably the most secure place of all time in the Cold War,” a David Hoffman, a longtime journalist and author of the 2009 book Dead Hand : The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy , explained in a podcast in 2015. Duty officers at their posts inside this structure would wait out their shifts watching for three lights to come on. One would come on when they had received their “predelegation” of authority. The next would confirm a complete “ decapitation ” of senior Soviet leadership. The last one would become illuminated after confirmation of an incoming nuclear strike. If all three became lit, they would begin initiating the ICBM launches via a secure communications network that included ballistic missile-like rockets carrying transmitters to broadcast launch codes remotely to personnel in silo complexes down below. An actual fully-automated doomsday system was reportedly also considered, but ultimately rejected. The Soviets reportedly switched on Perimeter operationally for the first time in 1984. At least some portion of the system was reportedly still in operation in post-Soviet Russia as of 2011. It’s also worth noting that the construction of Kosvinsky Kamen, which is often compared in form and function to the U.S. Air Force’s famous Cheyenne Mountain complex, was not declared to be totally finished until 1996 . This was notably followed the next year by the U.S. military’s introduction of the B61-11 nuclear bunker buster bomb. The timing of the introduction of that weapon was widely seen as a direct response to the completion of the Russian bunker complex. You can read more about that bomb and the rest of the B61 series in greater detail in this past War Zone piece . “Kosvinsky is regarded by U.S. targeteers as the crown jewel of the Russian wartime nuclear command system, because it can communicate through the granite mountain to far-flung Russian strategic forces using very-low-frequency (VLF) radio signals that can burn through a nuclear war environment,” Bruce Blair, who had previously served as an ICBM launch control officer and had worked on communications issues regarding strategic nuclear forces as part of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, wrote in The Washington Post in 2003. “Kosvinsky restores Russia’s confidence in its ability to carry out a retaliatory strike.” Blair, who died in July, had been first to publicly reveal details about Perimeter in 1993 and had gone on to work in the think tank and advocacy communities, including co-founding Global Zero , which advocates for the total elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide. Less is known about the facility at Mount Yamantau, which reportedly lies, at least in part, under some 3,000 feet of rock, primarily made up of quartz , and has been said to be absolutely massive, encompassing an area “as big as the Washington area inside the Beltway,” or around 400 square miles. The complex is situated within Mezhgorye, which is what is known in Russia as a closed town, where only authorized individuals are allowed to live and work. This facility is believed to be primarily a so-called continuity of government site for Russia’s top leadership to relocate to during any kind of major crisis, similar to the U.S. military’s Raven Rock Mountain Complex , or Site R, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. Raven Rock is generally described as an underground Pentagon, while Mount Weather is meant to provide a hardened location for the U.S. government’s top civilian leadership to operate from. Mount Yamantau., Yamigos via Wikimedia “It is more a shelter than a command post, because the facility’s communications links are relatively fragile,” Blair had written in 2003. “As it turned out, the quartz interferes with radio signals broadcast from inside the mountain.” The Russians have been very tight-lipped about this complex, construction of which was still ongoing, at least on some level, as of 1996. “The project has been variously described by present and former Russian officials as a mining site, a repository for Russian treasures, a food storage area, a dump for nuclear materials and a bunker for Russia’s leaders in case of nuclear war,” according to a report that year from The New York Times . Two years later, it was reported to be abandoned . This raises the question about whether work there subsequently resumed, if any technical issues regarding communications links to the outside world were resolved, and if this is the facility Putin may have been referring to in his remarks today. Of course, Putin may well be describing another previously unknown site that is now close to being completed. No matter what, it’s not necessarily surprising that there has been a revival of interest in at least a new-ish, deeply buried nuclear command and control bunker in Russia. For years now, the United States has been pushing ahead with a broad nuclear modernization effort , which includes the new B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb. This is the first variant in that series to feature precision guidance and reportedly has its own bunker-busting capabilities, though it’s unclear how it compares to the more specialized B61-11. The U.S. government has said that it will retain the B61-11 until it had confidence that the B61-12 can supplant it in this role. President Donald Trump’s Administration also announced in 2018 that it had decided to maintain an operational stockpile of B83-1 nuclear gravity bombs , which have very large yields, reported to be around 1.2 megatons, as an alternative nuclear means of striking at especially hardened facilities. These weapons had previously been slated for retirement. The U.S. Air Force also has the GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a 30,000-pound class conventional bunker-buster designed specifically strike deeply buried targets. You can read more about that weapon and the improvements that have been made to its design in this past War Zone piece . At the same time, the United States is actively pursuing a variety of conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons . These could be employed in short or virtually no-notice strikes on time-sensitive and other high-value targets, such as less-well-protected sites where the senior civilian and military leaderships of various countries operate on a day-to-day basis. It is worth noting that there are understood to be at least two underground bunker complexes in Moscow, one under the Kremlin and another nearby, similar to ones in Washington, D.C. , plus to more nearby in the Russian capital’s suburbs, but these are nowhere near as deeply buried as the ones at Kosvinsky Kamen and Mount Yamantau. In 2016, there was also a report that Russia was building “dozens” of new bunkers under the Kremlin and elsewhere to support its nuclear command and control infrastructure. Efforts to develop hypersonic, or kinds of longer-range conventionally-armed strike weapons , look set to further expand in the United States with the collapse of the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , or INF, last year. Putin and other senior Russian government officials could have concerns that this change in the balance of power presents new threats to the country’s leadership and, by extension, their ability to initiate a nuclear strike. Just last year, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev reiterated in an interview with the Moscow Times that there had been a very real belief that the intermediate-range missiles that the INF banned the United States from fielding had presented “the possibility of weapons capable of a ‘decapitation strike’…near our borders.” These kinds of fears have also been cited as possible reasons for the Russian government’s long-standing concerns that the United States could repurpose its Aegis Ashore missile defense sites in Europe to fire offensive strike weapons. All of this could further underscore the need in the minds of Putin and others in the Russian government for new hardened facilities, as well as the other improvements to the country’s overall nuclear command and control architecture that the Russian President called for in his meeting today. No matter what, with such relatively limited information available to this day about Kosvinsky Kamen and Mount Yamantau, it will be interesting to see what we learn about this newly disclosed bunker, wherever it might be located.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021","Navy “UFO Patent” Documents Talk Of “Spacetime Modification Weapon,” Detail Experimental Testing","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In our continuing investigation into the bizarre inventions of Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais, an enigmatic aerospace engineer who works for the U.S. Navy, The War Zone has just obtained a wide range of documents detailing experiments that the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) conducted to test the core concepts and technologies underlying his seemingly out of this world “ UFO patents .” These same patents were vouched for by the head of the Navy’s aerospace research enterprise who cited Chinese advances in similar technologies as one of the reasons why the Navy was filing them. The War Zone ‘s most recent report on the strange circumstances surrounding these patents underlined that there were indeed some type of physical experiments conducted related to them, even if very limited. Now, new Freedom of Information Act releases provide unprecedented insights not just into how seriously the Navy took Dr. Pais’s work, but also exactly how elements of it were actually tested at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars and where the program may have ended up. The materials even include mention of a “Spacetime Modification Weapon (SMW- a weapon that can make the Hydrogen bomb seem more like a firecracker, in comparison).” The releases, which are all related to a Naval Innovative Science and Engineering – Basic & Applied Research Program under the project name “The High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG),” contain hundreds of pages containing detailed technical drawings, photographs, and data related to actual tests of the HEEMFG. The system was meant to evaluate the feasibility of Dr. Salvatore Pais’s claimed “Pais Effect.” If you haven’t yet read about the ongoing saga of the enigmatic Dr. Pais and the science-fiction-like inventions he made on behalf of the Navy, be sure to get caught up on our previous reporting linked in order from the first to most recent here , here , here , here and here . An overview of Dr. Salvatore Pais’s claimed “High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator” technology., DON via FOIA Each one of Dr. Pais’s inventions is stated to be enabled through what he himself described to The War Zone as “the Pais Effect,” a theoretical physics concept that is claimed to be enabled through the “controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma) via accelerated spin and/or accelerated vibration under rapid (yet smooth) acceleration-deceleration-acceleration transients.” This effect, the inventor claims, can lead to incredibly powerful electromagnetic energy fields that can “ engineer the fabric of our reality at the most fundamental level” leading to incredible revolutions in power and propulsion, quantum communications, energy production, and even weaponry. These latest internal documents, which The War Zone obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), show that NAWCAD felt this technology has “National Security importance in leading to the generation of thermonuclear Fusion Ignition Energy with commercial as well as military application potential, in ensuring National Energy Dominance.” In addition, the documents contain the Basic and Applied Research (BAR) proposal that was submitted to secure funding and resources for the test of Pais’s High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator concept. In all, it appears at least $466,810 was devoted to the project between Fiscal Years 2017 and 2019 — far more than what was previously thought. Many of the documents also state that the HEEMFG project could be further continued by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), NASA, or even the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). At this time, it is unknown if the HEEMFG transitioned to other DoD agencies, but The War Zone is pursuing FOIA requests related to any possible collaborative transition. Another slide (below) indicates ONR, NRL, and DARPA as likely candidates for transition or collaboration. DON via FOIA The documents also show that a team of at least 10 technicians and engineers were assigned to design and test an experimental demonstrator and that testing was being conducted as recently as September 2019. DON via FOIA Over 1,600 hours of work were conducted in 2018 and 2019 on the project between design, procurement, manufacture, testing, and assembling final reports and technical papers. DON via FOIA Many of the documents describe the tests of the High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG) and the data that resulted. Some of these documents describe specific “Identified Technical Obstacles” and proposed solutions for developing a working HEEMFG device. One test asset used in experiments appears to have been a “coin cell capacitor” with a 0.276-inch diameter, which was connected to a vertical drive spindle and spun up to 100,000 rotations-per-minute (RPM) with a 2-inch air motor. Other experiments describe spinning a 12-inch disk featuring piezoelectric elements arranged in a cruciform (cross- or x-shaped) arrangement. These larger discs were charged with much larger capacitors. DON via FOIA The devices tested appear to have been benchtop versions of Pais’s HEEMFG concept, or perhaps even multiple versions of the same idea. The devices used spinning capacitors to “demonstrate the experimental feasibility of achieving high electromagnetic field-energy flux values toward the design of advanced high energy density / high power propulsion systems.” DON via FOIA In one strange section describing test results, investigators reported that technicians felt a strange sensation on their skin as they approached the test article, although they note that there are plenty of prosaic explanations for such sensations. DON via FOIA One of the most bizarre documents in these releases, a slide deck marked For Official Use Only (FOUO), describes how Pais’ Plasma Compression Fusion Device patent could be used to design a terrifying-sounding new form of weapon known as a “Spacetime Modification Weapon:” Under uniquely defined conditions, the Plasma Compression Fusion Device can lead to development of a Spacetime Modification Weapon (SMW- a weapon that can make the Hydrogen bomb seem more like a firecracker, in comparison). Extremely high energy levels can be achieved with this invention, under pulsed ultrahigh current (I) / ultrahigh magnetic flux density (B) conditions (Z-pinch with a Fusion twist). DON via FOIA In one of the final test results sections, investigators note that the “Principle Investigator [sic] also desired vibratory excitation of the charged test disk” but noted that “the tested configuration does not have a method for providing spindle vibration.” It is unknown whether further test articles were designed that were capable of the high levels of vibration cited as a requisite for enabling the radical emerging physics Pais claims his HEEMFG to be capable of producing. It is curious that a test article was not designed that incorporated vibration since the inventor always cites the coupling of accelerated spin and accelerated vibration as key components of the “Pais Effect,” but it may be simply that the restraints of existing test facilities and equipment were to blame. Often when new experimental systems are tested, subsequent experiments work toward mastering different aspects of a particular design before bringing everything together once the separate components are proven to be feasible. It’s unclear whether or not the HEEMFG test article was designed to focus on maturing just one part of the complete system. DON via FOIA Ultimately, these documents show that while the experimental test articles constructed by NAWCAD “performed well,” they neither observed nor disproved the Pais Effect. DON via FOIA As usual, our investigation into the Dr. Salvatore Pais patents assigned to the Navy has generated more questions and lines of investigation. It is unknown if any of these concepts or technologies were, in fact, transferred to other entities, including elsewhere within the Department of Defense outside of the Navy, or whether further test articles were created and experimented on that might have included mechanisms to induce high-frequency vibrations. As with all of the documentation we have gathered related to these patents so far, it appears even NAWCAD’s testing could not confirm experimental validation of the claimed “Pais Effect.” Despite the lack of experimental confirmation, a Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAVAIR) quad chart published in September 2018 states that NAVAIR was aiming to transition the technology in 2019. A 2018 quad chart regarding the High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator (HEEMFG) project., DON via FOIA An August 2019 NAVAIR Science & Technology Alignment and Investment Reporting System (STAIRS) report states that “the spin test to evaluate the HEEMFG effect took place in late September 2018” and that while the tests “did not measure any anomalous electromagnetic effects that would satisfy the theory,” investigators believe “the reason for this is that the capacitor confined the electrons to its center, rather than the surface, which is necessary for generation of the effect.” The report concludes its in its future outlook by noting that “planning has been in progress to compensate for the effect seen on the capacitor in the end of FY2018, with [a] new experimental setup to be completed by July 2019.” DON via FOIA The further our investigation continues, the more it seems like the patents of Dr. Salvatore Pais are exactly what they appear to be: hypothetical applications of theoretical physics the Navy thinks are viable enough to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on, and possibly much more, to someday be able to master. Yet considering there have been all types of theories, ranging from a government disinformation campaign to alien emulation technology, behind these patents, we still can’t say conclusively what is going on here. Still, taken at face value, these new documents seem to prove even further that these inventions were not solely the product of an enigmatic maverick inventor, but instead received support from the highest levels of NAWCAD and led to DoD-funded research projects and experiments with an eye on producing exotic new forms of propulsion and weaponry. Whether these experiments were the start of a looming energy revolution or a dead-end is yet to be understood, but by the looks of the documentation we have studied, it seems like these experiments were more of a beginning than an end. This is all fascinating as no physicist we have discussed Pais’s patents with sees how they are feasible, yet the Navy seems to have thought otherwise and spent considerable funds to explore the ideas in the form of physical experiments. In light of these new documents, we have already reached out to NAWCAD in hopes of establishing a dialogue about the High Energy Electromagnetic Field Generator and the other Salvatore Pais patents. In the past, they have been unwilling to do so. We at The War Zone have just begun combing through this huge batch of new documents and we will report more once we have concluded our review of them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 2, 2020",Biden And Putin Confirm Last-Minute Push To Extend Key Nuclear Arms Control Deal After Call,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Readouts of the first call between Joe Biden as U.S. President and Russian President Vladimir Putin today show a clear commitment to extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START , as is and without any apparent preconditions, for another five years. This deal, which is otherwise set to expire next week, places hard limits on the total number of strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, as defined by the agreement, as well as the warheads that they carry, that each country can possess. Without this arrangement in place, there would be nothing to stop the two countries from engaging in a new nuclear arms race. The White House’s statement about the details of the call says the two leaders also discussed the situation in Ukraine , the Russian-linked SolarWinds hack , intelligence indicating the Russian government placed bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Russian interference in the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections in the United States, the attempted assassination of now-jailed Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. The Kremlin’s press release makes no mention of any of those issues. It does bring up the matters of the Open Skies Treaty and the controversial agreement over Iran’s nuclear program, both of which President Donald Trump had withdrawn from. Russia remains party to the Iran Deal, which the new Biden Administration has also expressed an interest in rejoining, but recently announced that it would also be pulling out of Open Skies. Then-Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with then-Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during a meeting in 2011., AP New START was clearly a primary focus of the call. Both official readouts mention Biden and Putin’s discussion of this treaty first and provide more detail about the diplomatic work going on around that deal than to any of the other topics. Reports that an agreement on a five-year extension was in the works had first emerged last week . “They discussed both countries’ willingness to extend New START for five years, agreeing to have their teams work urgently to complete the extension by February 5,” the White House’s statement says. “The Presidents expressed satisfaction in connection with the exchange of diplomatic notes carried out today on reaching an agreement on the extension of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms,” a translation of the Kremlin’s readout adds. “In the coming days, the parties will complete all the necessary procedures to ensure the further functioning of this important international legal mechanism for the mutual limitation of nuclear missile arsenals.” Open launch tubes on the US Navy’s ballistic missile submarine USS Ohio . Ohio class ballistic missile submarines are among the nuclear weapons delivery systems subject to the New START treaty., USN The Kremlin’s comments about the exchange of diplomatic notes and the parties moving ahead to formalize the five-year extension of New START are further confirmed by the website of Russia’s parliament, or Duma. Today, a legislative package regarding the ratification of this modification to the treaty, which includes copies of the diplomatic notes, was posted on that site . In the United States, Congress does not have to approve the extension. “On behalf of the United States of America, the Embassy proposes that the duration of the Treaty be extended for a period of five years, until February 5, 2026, pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article XTV of the Treaty,” the note from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow says. “If this proposal is acceptable to the Russian Federation, the Embassy proposes that this note, together with the Ministry’s note in reply to that effect, shall constitute an agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation to extend the Treaty that shall enter into force on the date of the later note in an exchange of notes between the Parties confirming that any internal procedures necessary for the entry into force of this agreement have been completed.” US Department of State via the Russian Duma On Apr. 8, 2010, then-President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart at the time, Dmitry Medvedev, signed New START, which subsequently entered into force on Feb. 5, 2011. The deal’s three key provisions are as follows: Neither country may have more than 700 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and nuclear-capable heavy bombers deployed at any one time. Both sides cannot have more than 1,550 deployed nuclear “warheads,” with heavy bombers, as well as individual re-entry vehicles on ICBMs and SLBMs, each counting as one warhead. No more than 800 deployed and non-deployed bombers, as well as ICBM and SLBM “launchers,” the latter of which include silos, road-mobile launchers, and individual launch tubes on ballistic missile submarines. As referenced in the U.S. Embassy’s diplomatic note, the treaty has always included a provision for a five-year extension without preconditions. However, the Trump Administration and the Kremlin had been locked in negotiations over a host of issues, including debates over extending the deal to cover certain new, novel nuclear weapons Russia has been developing, such as the Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile . There had also been a desire on the U.S. government side to somehow pull China , which has a growing strategic nuclear arsenal , into the New START framework as a potential path to a future trilateral nuclear arms control deal. By October 2020, the Trump Administration had shifted to pushing for an extension of the existing deal, but with a demand that Russia agree to a total freeze in the total number of nuclear warheads on both sides. As of Dec. 1, 2020, per the U.S. State Department , the United States had 1,457 deployed warheads, per New START’s definitions, while Russia had 1,447. Russia had countered with an offer to agree to a one-year extension with no preconditions. Both sides now appear to be moving forward quickly to formalize an agreement regarding the full five-year extended term as outlined in the original treaty. A load of AGM-86 air-launched cruise missiles next to a US Air Force B-52 bomber. The nuclear-tipped AGM-86B variant is the only version of this weapon still in service and is only certified to be carried by nuclear-capable B-52s. , USAF Doing so gives both parties an entirely new period in which to negotiate new provisions to the existing deal or an entirely new follow-on deal and help stave off a major arms race. It also preserves the last remaining major bilateral arms control agreement between the two countries, following the collapse of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, in 2019 and the U.S. government’s withdrawal from Open Skies in 2020. Continued diplomatic engagement on New START could potentially provide a springboard for further discussions on arms control and related issues. Last year, Putin had already proposed limiting where Russia could deploy missiles that had violated the INF, including assurances that they would not be placed in the country’s geographically separated Kaliningrad enclave , which is effectively one large military base on the Baltic Sea, in exchange for inspections of U.S. missile defense sites in Europe . Russian forces launch a 9M728 ground-launched cruise missile during an exercise. The U.S. alleged that the new 9M729 ground-launched missile violated the INF and subsequently pulled out of the treaty as a result., Russian MoD At the same time, there’s no guarantee that the Biden Administration will have success in negotiating any new arms control deals with Russia in the next four years. U.S.-Russia relations are, at best, cool, and it’s not clear when they might improve, even when just considering the litany of very serious issues listed in the White House’s readout of the first Biden-Putin call. With regards to New START, or any potential follow-on agreement, specifically, this five-year extension stretches into the next presidential term, which could complicate matters if negotiations drag on as they did during the Trump Administration. All told, the extension of New START, which looks all but certain to be formalized in the coming days, is a positive development. It will now be up to the U.S. and Russian governments to make the most of this new space to negotiate, or risk finding themselves in the exact same predicament five years from now.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 21, 2019","Air Force Fighters Almost Got An Air-Launched Ballistic Missile 40 Years Ago, Now They’re A Hot Item","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Air Force planned to arm its tactical fighter jets with an air-launched ballistic missile. The Joint Tactical Missile System program was run jointly with the U.S. Army and would have given the Air Force its own improved version of the Lance quasi-ballistic missile. In some ways, the program had parallels with Russia’s Kinzhal missile, which The War Zone has examined in detail in the past and, more loosely, it shared similarities with the types of air-launched ballistic missiles now under development in China . During the 1970s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began to look at ways of attacking Warsaw Pact armor deep in enemy territory, without necessarily having to use nuclear weapons. The resulting Assault Breaker program brought together a range of different technologies — among them lasers, electro-optical sensors, airborne radars , and precision-guided munitions — to defeat these kinds of targets. Two XMGM-52 Lance missiles are fired from A and C Battery, 1st Battalion, 12th Artillery Regiment, at the White Sands Missile Range in 1987. The Lance served as the basis for the Assault Breaker, and later Vought’s JTACMS proposal. , Public Domain However, the ambitious Assault Breaker program had begun to fragment by the early 1980s, with the Army focusing more on ground systems and helicopters, while the Air Force eyed new methods of delivering munitions from manned aircraft. This model shows that the American ATACMS ballistic missile may have an air-launched variant. pic.twitter.com/LMgo5x2hlS — Caesar (@Ninja998998) January 26, 2021 Amid pressure from the U.S. Congress to more closely align similar programs across the services, the Department of Defense drew up plans for new Joint programs in 1983, still with the broad aim of defeating rear-echelon targets. These new J-programs included the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), as well as the Joint Tactical Missile System (JTACMS), both of which were essentially spinoffs of Assault Breaker technologies. JTACMS took shape when the previous Army-led Corps Support Weapon System (CSWS), intended to replace the MGM-52 Lance short-range ballistic missile, was integrated with the Air Force’s Conventional Standoff Weapon (CSW) program. The Army criteria for the weapon included a range greater than the existing tube-launched and rocket artillery systems, while the Air Force required a standoff weapon to attack high-priority targets. Pre-development contracts were awarded to several companies, among them the Vought Corporation, the firm responsible for the Lance, as well as the Boeing Aerospace Company, and Martin Marietta Aerospace. These contracts were funded on a 50/50 basis by the Army and Air Force. However, the airframe competition was limited to Vought and Martin Marietta, who offered the same basic designs as they had for Assault Breaker: the T22 and T16, respectively. The T22, Vought’s entrant in the Storm Breaker program, was repurposed as the JTACMS., Lockheed Martin Vought produced an Improved Lance concept to meet the JTACMS requirement and, based on the firm’s publicity material, it seems that this reached the stage of a mock-up carried under the wing of an F-16. Desktop models were also produced showing Vought’s weapon carried by both the F-16 and by A-7 attack aircraft , while company advertising promoted the air-launched version of the Improved Lance as a potential B-52 weapon, as well. In the 1980s, did you think the US Army had a truck-mounted Lance ballistic missile launcher? pic.twitter.com/cQFoP1SNUA — Caesar (@Ninja998998) May 23, 2019 While specifications for the air-launched version of the weapon are not available, it is known that the Vought T22-derived JTACMS was broadly similar in size to the original Lance, which had a length of 20 feet and weighed roughly 3,000 pounds, depending on the warhead type. Unlike the Lance, the new weapon featured cruciform-shaped mid-body wings, plus elevon control surfaces at the rear. For propulsion, the air-launched JTACMS traded the liquid-propellant rocket of the original Lance for a solid-fuel motor using low-cost propellant taken from the MLRS, which would have offered greater range, reliability, and safety. While the original Lance could deliver a conventional or nuclear warhead to a distance of up to 75 miles, in the Improved Lance version, this was extended to over 200 miles, and this is likely to have been the same for the ground-launched JTACMS, too. The rival to the Vought airframe proposal, Martin Marietta’s T16 was derived from its Patriot surface-to-air missile . This retained the Patriot’s booster section but added a new nosecone carrying a submunitions warhead and inertial guidance package. It is likely that the Vought proposal featured the same warhead/guidance. A rare image apparently showing the Martin Marietta JTACMS carried by an F-16. , PUBLIC DOMAIN In both cases, the primary source of targeting data was expected to be via data-link to a Pave Mover moving target indication and synthetic aperture capable radar, which would also be able to correct the course of the missiles once in flight. This same technology would later provide the basis of the JSTARS system, now mounted onboard the Air Force’s E-8C platform. Launching a ballistic missile from the air, rather than from the ground, would have had the advantage of increasing range even further (by a factor of approximately four), deployability, and flexibility. The aircraft carrying the missile would be able to release it without having to enter the engagement zones of hostile tactical surface-to-air missiles, striking key targets such as massed formations of armor, air defense sites, communications nodes, and airfields, with relative impunity. It would have provided a serious headache for enemy air defense operators and systems, otherwise optimized for targeting manned aircraft and slower-flying cruise missiles. Indeed, the presence of air-launched JTACMS would have demanded an appropriate response from the Soviet side, in the form of additional, more layered ballistic missile defenses, new targeting sensors, and longer-range anti-aircraft missiles to down the F-16, for example, before it could unleash its missiles. A Cold War-era Department of Defense image of an SA-6 Gainful mobile surface-to-air missile system. The air-launched JTACMS promised to allow aircraft to launch the missiles before penetrating much of the Warsaw Pact’s air defense network., PUBLIC DOMAIN Despite this promise, the Air Force only remained in the JTACMS program until 1985, when it left to pursue its own goals once again, shelving the idea of an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) altogether. In any event, the end of the Cold War changed almost entirely the types of targets that the Air Force was likely to be assigned anyway, at least in the short term, and instead of prioritizing speed and size for its munitions, the service’s next generation of standoff weapons was tailored for range and low-observable characteristics. The Army was left to continue what was now known as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which resulted in Vought being chosen as prime contractor for the MGM-140 missile that was first test-flown in prototype form in 1988. This weapon is also roughly similar to its Lance predecessor in terms of weight, but is somewhat more compact, with a length of 13 feet. The ATACMS — pronounced “attack-ums” — can carry a 500-pound warhead to targets approximately 186 miles away. An ATACMS is fired over the cab of an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher. , U.S. Army The MGM-140A ATACMS became operational in January 1991 and saw its first combat use during Operation Desert Storm in the same year. Today, improved versions of the ATACMS remain in use with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and have been widely exported. The current prime contractor for ATACMS is Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the same contractor is now working on a planned replacement, under the Precision Strike Missile program , or PrSM. While the Air Force had tried and failed to field a strategic air-launched ballistic missile in the 1960s, the concept of a tactical ALBM proved just as unsuccessful in the early 1980s. But that is not to say that the air-launched JTACMS would not have been successful. One modern parallel to the air-launched JTACMS is the Russian Kinzhal, an adaptation of the Iskander tactical ballistic missile, which is itself broadly comparable to the ATACMS. While the Iskander on which the Kinzhal is based is similar in length to the Lance, at 24 feet, it is a substantially heavier missile, weighing around 8,400 pounds. This requires the missile to be carried by the MiG-31 heavy interceptor, which can accommodate a single Kinzhal under the fuselage. A MiG-31 armed with a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile., Russian Ministry of Defense China, for its part, is also developing ALBMs. Apparently intended primarily for the anti-ship mission, these include an air-launched version of the DF-21D and they will be expected to function as part of the anti-access/area-denial strategy aimed at keeping U.S. Navy carrier strike groups at bay. Potentially, we may also in the future see some of China’s short-range ballistic missile designs migrated to air-launched applications, provided that isn’t already happening. A closer modern counterpart to the air-launched JTACMS is perhaps the Israeli Rampage, an air-launched derivative of IMI Systems’ ground-launched Extended Range Artillery guided artillery rocket, or EXTRA. You can read more about the Rampage here , suffice to say, it is also suitable for carriage aboard the F-16 and is similarly intended to strike fixed targets at standoff range, using its speed to confound complex air defense environments. Test launch of the Rampage missile from an Israeli Air Force F-16., IMI SYSTEMS Meanwhile, the Israeli Rocks missile is also similar, an air-launched ballistic missile that combines features from existing precision-guided bombs and a ballistic missile defense surrogate target missile. Like JTACMS and Rampage, this weapon has also been certified for carriage by the F-16, although it seems to be intended primarily for attacking hardened targets. Weapons like the Kinzhal, Rampage, and Rocks are potentially ideal for short-notice strikes on time-sensitive and highly defended targets, including mobile air defense systems and mobile ballistic missiles , giving them little, if any time to fire, seek cover, or otherwise relocate. There is no reason why the JTACMS couldn’t have provided the U.S. Air Force with similar capabilities. These would have provided a relatively low-cost means to holding key targets at risk across the enemy rear area and could have engaged them rapidly at the onset of hostilities. The Rafael Rocks missile bears a striking resemblance to the Cold War-era JTACMS., Rafael Today, the focus of related activity in the United States is firmly on the B-52, set to become a major launch platform for oversized weapons . While the AGM-183A Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, might look like an air-launched ballistic missile, its centerpiece is a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle payload that is capable of maneuvering inside the atmosphere at extreme speeds. The Air Force is looking to integrate other boost-glide vehicles, as well as air-breathing hypersonic missiles onto the B-52 in the future. These weapons all promise high speed and impressive range but, for now, as far we know, the United States is not working on a true ALBM, and certainly not one that could also be mounted onboard a relatively small fighter jet, like the F-16. However, the growing interest in ALBMs — especially those that are lower-cost adaptations of existing ground-launched systems — suggests that a weapon like the JTACMS could still be a useful part of the Air Force armory today.

Jamie Hunter,"Updated on May 18, 2021",Fighter Pilots Reveal Why You Don’t Want To Mess With The A-10 Warthog In A Dogfight,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II is the king of close air support (CAS) — supporting troops on the ground with its blistering array of firepower — many would be surprised to know that it is also no slouch when it comes to air-to-air fighting. While the “Warthog” isn’t optimized for the air superiority role and lacks key capabilities, such as high-speed, radar, and radar-guided long-range missiles that make its fighter brethren such air-to-air supremos, even the greatest fighter pilots are rightfully wary of getting into a close-in turning dogfight with a ‘lowly’ mud-moving A-10. The slow-speed agility of the tank-busting Warthog, combined with some clever tactics, means that even the most advanced fighter aircraft can get a nasty sting from an accomplished “Hog” driver. Indeed, the U.S. Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, actually teaches the art of Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) in its bi-annual A-10 class, just in case pilots find themselves in a sticky situation with a pouncing enemy fighter. Colonel Denny “Gator” Yount retired from the USAF in 2011 with an impressive 3,852 hours in the A-10. He says that of the many highlights in his career, specializing in A-10 BFM at the Weapons School as an instructor ranks as one of the most rewarding. “The air-to-air guys have a radar and they are a lot faster than we are, but they quickly learn that it doesn’t pay for them to get into the proverbial phone booth with us for a close-in dogfight .” An A-10C of the 66th Weapons Squadron carrying an AN/ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures pod on its outer left wing station., Jamie Hunter “The Weapons School takes the best of the best pilots from the operational A-10 wings. It runs two six-month courses each year and the students start out with academics for a couple of weeks and then they begin flying,” explains Yount. “BFM was, and still remains, the first phase of the course. It’s like planting the flag — no matter how good the student thinks they are, this is how tough the course is going to be. The Weapons School flies at a level the students have never previously experienced.” Yount went through Weapons School in 1993 as a student. As he stated, today, the 66th Weapons Squadron’s A-10 course at Nellis still kicks-off with BFM as its opening phase. While it teaches pilots how to react to an air threat, it’s more geared towards teaching them how to max-perform the Warthog — pushing it right to its prescribed limits — before progressing into the more traditional A-10 air-to-ground mission sets. On the A-10 Weapons School course, the students will drop and employ almost every weapon in the Hog’s impressive arsenal. Yount returned to Nellis as a Weapons School instructor from January 1996 until October 1999. “I was primarily the BFM guy,” he explains. “We pretty much stripped the airplanes off — most of the pylons and TERs [Triple Ejector Racks] — but kept two AIM-9 Sidewinders and our ECM [electronic countermeasures] pod. We taught the principles of BFM, which was based around 1-v-1 close-in fighting with another A-10. The BFM phase led into an ACM [Air Combat Maneuvering] phase, and we did some 2-v-1 and 2-v-2 set-ups. We used to bring in the German F-4 training unit from Holloman [AFB, New Mexico] or work with the Nellis aggressor F-16s .” An A-10 Weapons School instructor pilot., Jamie Hunter “Even if a student was pretty good, if they couldn’t teach the techniques, they were no good to us as a Weapons Officer. Whether you’re the best bomb-dropper or best at BFM, if you can’t go back to your squadron and teach it, you’re worthless. You’ve got to be able to spread the knowledge in the squadrons.” “BFM was one of my natural inclinations,” Yount continues. “I was always pretty good at it, having started out as a T-38 Talon Instructor Pilot. Some of my F-15 friends taught me the basics. By the time I went through Fighter Lead-In Training in the Talon, I had about 1,200 hours in that jet.” Yount says operational A-10 squadrons don’t regularly practice BFM at the unit level, because they typically have so many higher-priority boxes to tick for CAS and bomb-dropping, for example. However, there are examples of fighter squadrons requesting Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) with A-10 units to gain insight into dealing with this tricky opponent. One F-16 pilot told The War Zone “We actually fly DACT with A-10s quite a bit. We call it “Hog Popping” and it’s quite popular! They start their circle of Hogs to cover each others’ six o’clocks in a defensive posture. Then we poke our noses in and try to pick them off. The key is to come in with lots of speed, shoot, and climb back up where the “Hogs” don’t have the energy to point their nose up.” Yount says: “The fighters generally stay high and try to point their nose in, trying to get the shot, and then get the hell out of there — because we can’t chase them out high and we can’t run them down. But if they stay in the turning fight with us in our environment we are very happy to do that all day long.” “BFM is a mission set that A-10 guys hopefully never have to use, because the theory is that you’re doing it in self-defense. The F-15s, or other Defensive Counter Air jets, should be on top of us, keeping all that stuff out of our way. But if you get a “leaker” [an enemy fighter that gets past the DCA] you need to train how to survive with the two AIM-9M Sidewinders and the ECM [ AN/ALQ-131 electronic countermeasures] pod. These are the only things that stay on the airplane if you hit the big red button to punch off the stores.” This throws off the excess weight and drag of the external stores, making the A-10 more agile, and giving the pilot a greater chance of evading the threat. The Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) in the A-10 alerts the pilot if the aircraft is being tracked by an enemy radar. The ECM pod provides an opportunity to jam the fighter’s radar, however, Yount says at this point the main tactic is to try and get into the doppler notch [a tactical move used to hide in a fighter radar’s blind spot, that you can read all about here ], to change altitude, and try to pitch back into the approaching fighter. “Whether you are the attacker or the defender, you want to make the first move. If you aren’t driving the fight, you’re being driven.” “Most pilots of other types didn’t really understand our strengths until they had fought us a few times. Regardless of their turn rate, the best turn radius will get the first shot opportunity. At the corner, our turn radius was about 1,700 feet, and when I’m almost dead out of energy it’s about 2,100 feet — that’s not very big at all. So, even if they can out rate me, my gun can cross their nose before they can come around. They have to respect that gun — which means they have to jink out of the way, which in turn presents some opportunities. If you put an A-10 in that close turning fight, we do very, very , well.” An A-10C from the USAF Weapons School dispenses decoy flares. Note the inboard leading-edge slats., Jamie Hunter The two offensive weapons available to an A-10 pilot in this situation are the AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking missile, and the fearsome GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm seven-barrel Gatling-style cannon, which is traditionally regarded as an air-to-ground strafe weapon, but it’s also very lethal for air-to-air gunnery. The A-10 is not equipped with the newer AIM-9X , so despite pilots now wearing the Thales Scorpion helmet-mounted sight, they aren’t able to engage an adversary with a high off-boresight missile shot. Therefore, the turn rate is critical when it comes to bringing the Sidewinder or the gun to bear on an enemy bandit. “If they get into the turning fight with us they deplete a lot of energy,” explains Yount. “Then they want to bug out, light the afterburner and get away — but all that does is make my AIM-9 lock-on alarm scream louder!” If the pilot selects the AIM-9 it switches the weapons system in the A-10 to an air-to-air mode. If the pilot wants to employ the gun, it presents a “funnel” in the Head-Up Display (HUD) to give the pilot an idea of the bullet track and distance to the target. The A-10 lacks a radar, so using this symbology effectively is as much an art form as a science. Yount says selecting the AIM-9 or the gun very much depends on the range of the opponent. “When we train, of course, we don’t have live rounds in the gun — we are only shooting electrons — but you can still see everything in the HUD.” “What you can’t simulate is the effect of the gun firing,” Yount enthuses. “That plume of white smoke usually flows underneath the airplane, but when it rolls up over the canopy, it shows you’re pulling hard and it has a real effect on the opponent, knowing they are being fired at by that gun. It helps with you being really threatening — make them want to get out of the way of the gun and the Sidewinder, so they have to go away, and then re-engage.” “You’re going to do a one-to-two second burst with the gun, that’s about 100 rounds. You can’t just hammer down. I’ve shot the gun in an air-to-air scenario while pulling Gs, and when you’re pulling hard, the smoke is flowing up and over the canopy — you can’t see!” Gun gas spills from the A-10’s 30mm cannon., USAF/SrA Mercedee Wilds When a fighter squadron plans some dogfighting time with A-10s, it does so with a mindset that the Hogs are at a clear disadvantage. So there are some sensible limitations placed on the fighters, such as the air-to-air hardware that they can employ. Recalling a recent DACT detachment to fight with A-10s, one F-15C pilot told The War Zone : “The slow speed handling and tiny turn circle size threw most of us off for the first fight. A lot of the fights ended neutral — apart from when we took shots with our AIM-9X combined with the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System of course. Some Hogs took shots on us — mostly with the gun because we aren’t used to looking at an A-10, so range cues were a lot different, plus their gun has so much longer range than the cannons in most fighters. However, they don’t have exact ranging, so any time they can point at you they will call a gunshot, regardless of whether it will get there or not. All the shots I saw were at least in the ballpark, but they are just being taken way longer ranges than anyone else — so guys aren’t expecting that. It’s really hard to aim that far away, so I’m not sure how it would’ve gone if it had been real.” An F-16C flies alongside an A-10C Thunderbolt II., Jamie Hunter The Weapons School used to conduct air-to-air gunnery detachments to Tyndall AFB, Florida, to live-fire AIM-9s as well as to shoot the Aerial Gunnery Target (AGT) with the Avenger cannon. “An F-15 would pull the AGT for us, but we had to be really careful not to hit that, because our rounds would just shred it. So we had to go for near misses, and use the acoustic scoring system that picked up the “cracks” as the rounds shot past.” Discussing the BFM techniques he taught at the Weapons School, Yount says: “We started out with the offensive aircraft in a high perch behind the defensive aircraft, so it had every advantage. You move into the 6,000-9,000-feet range in a five to seven o’clock position, then it’s “ready, ready, fight’s on!” We then moved into some neutral setups where we would split, point at each other, and when we passed abeam each other, we called “fight’s on” at the merge.” Chasing down an opponent, Yount says “you want to be just outside the flightpath and slightly high. If you think of them towing a cone-like a windsock behind, that’s where you want to be — just above that sock, and stay there. About 1,500-6,000-feet back works for any airplane, but staying there is tough. I can drag my lower wing through that wake turbulence, and that’s how I taught guys where they needed to be if they couldn’t visualize it — that’s the flight path.” An A-10C assigned to the USAF Weapons School., Jamie Hunter “As a defender, I used to call it my “cone head defense.” I’d take my arms and put them above my head to make a cone — that’s what you want to point at the opponent, because that’s the top of your lift vector. If they slide back, it’s harder to get the cone pointing at them — they’re building angles on you.” The A-10 pilot has an audible stall warning system known as the “horn,” which advances in a “chopped tone” under sustained heavy G. These are staged warnings as a measure of the aircraft’s performance. “There are slats on the leading edge of the inner portion of the wing,” Yount explains. “If you get the chopped tone too long, you’ll stall that portion of the wing. I could trim the airplane to a speed and I didn’t need to jink all over the place, I just had to keep that cone on the other jet. I could just put my hands above my head and fly with my knees.” “We also did some low-level escape and evasion. Most guys weren’t trained down to 100 feet — and chasing students down at that height is a lot of fun! Get below 80 feet with any kind of downward vector and “Bitching Betty” would ask you to pull up.” “If you are down low, you have some advantages in the air-to-air fight with ground clutter or if the pilot of the other jet just didn’t want to follow you down there. But it’s better to maintain height, because it gives you more options.” “What the A-10 doesn’t do very well is get its energy back quickly. We always said with regard to the [General Electric TF34] engines that we don’t need more speed, we need more power. The speeds we operate and drop at are plenty fast enough for what we are doing. For BFM, we are at a great speed and turn radius to point and shoot.” Devoid of heavy external stores, this A-10C of the Weapons School returns to Nellis AFB., Jamie Hunter Despite the many attempts to kill-off the A-10 , Yount is adamant that no other jet can do the job like the Warthog. “Until the USAF has a platform that can turn on a dime and bring all those weapons to bear at relatively close quarters, there’s no substitute for that.” While the A-10 has a ferocious reputation for supporting troops on the ground, and for Combat Search And Rescue, wheeling above the battlefield and dishing out punishment where it’s needed, it also has a nasty bite if any enemy fighters want to give them a hard time. Instructors like Colonel Yount made it their job to ensure that if the time came when an A-10 pilot was threatened by a marauding fighter, they knew exactly what to do, so they could defend themselves by either putting up a fight or running away bravely to fight another day.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 24, 2021",The “Lady Bird Special” Was The Lowliest Of Air Force One Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hear the words ‘ Air Force One ’ and the chances are the aircraft you picture is not a propeller-driven, adapted utility transport, with four passenger seats and a couple of foldout tables, whisking its high-profile passengers along at a leisurely speed of just over 250 miles per hour. Back in 1966, however, the U.S. Air Force really did assign a single VIP-configured Beechcraft twin turboprop to the mission of presidential transport , for the use of President Lyndon B. Johnson and his family. Receiving the Air Force designation VC-6A, the one-off aircraft, serial number 66-07943, was based on the civilian B90 King Air. For its time, this was among the most popular executive twin-turboprops available, and for good reason. Even in the basic version offered on the commercial market, the B90 featured cabin pressurization, seating for up to nine including the pilot, and compared to its predecessors, it added more powerful Pratt & Whitney PT6A-20 turboprops each rated at 550 horsepower. VC-6A outside the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio., U.S. Air Force “The aircraft was faster and more agile than other light transport aircraft and featured full pressurization for comfort at high altitudes,” in the words of the National Museum of the United States Air Force’s official online history of the VC-6A. A rare photo of the Air Force VC-6A “Lady Bird Special” in service., U.S. Air Force The changes introduced for the aircraft’s presidential transport included all-weather navigation and de-icing equipment. Newly installed reversible propellers allowed the aircraft to land on very short runways if required. All this came at a cost of $436,0000 and, according to the late aviation historian Robert F. Dorr, it was “purchased expressly to meet Lyndon B. Johnson’s needs.” Once in service, the VC-6A duly served primarily as the personal transport for Johnson and his family, earning the nickname “Lady Bird Special,” on account of the First Lady, Claudia “Lady Bird” Johnson. In this role, the aircraft ferried the first family between Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas — today home to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport — and the roughly mile-long airstrip at the Johnson Ranch, near Stonewall in Texas, around 70 miles to the west. Cockpit of the VC-6A., U.S. Air Force While the Johnson Ranch airstrip was plenty long enough for the VC-6A, and even the turbine-powered VC-140B JetStar “Air Force One Half” also used by Johnson, it couldn’t accommodate the more familiar VC-137B that was the best-known user of the Air Force One callsign in this era. Instead, the President would take the VC-137B into Bergstrom before using the smaller VC-140B — or the even smaller VC-6B — as a shuttle to their destination. The VC-6B had seating for Johnson and up to three other family members, visiting dignitaries, or high-level government personnel. A U.S. Air Force VC-140B waits on the tarmac at President Lyndon B. Johnson’s family ranch near Stonewall, Texas, in June 1967. , U.S. Air Force After President Johnson left office in January 1969, the VC-6A remained in use as an executive transport with the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base , Maryland. Finally, in September 1985, it was retired and took up its place at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. As a footnote to the VC-6A story, it’s worth noting that the U.S. Army also acquired a single example, which was also associated with at least one high-profile passenger. The Army’s VC-6A, serial number 66-15361, was based on the civilian Model 65-A90 and was used to ferry the rocket and space technology pioneer Wernher von Braun between the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama and the military testing area at the White Sands Missile Range , New Mexico, where he oversaw rocket experiments during the 1960s. Today, this aircraft is also on public display, at the White Sands Missile Range Museum . U.S. Army VC-6A 66-15361 at the White Sands Missile Range Museum., Zruda via Flickr Creative Commons Different variants of the King Air, of course, remain in frontline service with and on behalf of the U.S. military, but it’s fitting in particular that the sole Air Force VC-6A is preserved today, as a reminder of how this type’s illustrious service career began, and of the surprising variety of the high-profile presidential air transport mission and the many historic milestones it has witnessed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2020",Boeing And Lockheed Martin Reveal What Could Be The Army’s UH-60 Black Hawk Replacement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing and Lockheed Martin have unveiled their proposed helicopter, dubbed Defiant X, for the U.S. Army’s Future Long Range Assault Aircraft , or FLRAA, program, which is part of the larger Future Vertical Lift effort. This particular project’s primary goal is to acquire a replacement for the service’s venerable UH-60 Black Hawks , including highly modified special operations variants , but could eventually replace other aircraft types across the U.S. military, as well. The companies simultaneously revealed the Defiant X in press releases on Jan. 25, 2021. The design is an advanced compound helicopter derived from the SB>1 Defiant , which Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, and Boeing developed for the Army’s Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program. Bell has also been a participant in the JMR effort with its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor. JMR has long been framed as a lead-in to FLRAA and, in December 2020, the Army released a draft request for proposals for the latter program, announcing in the process that it only planned to consider entries from the Boeing-Lockheed Martin team and Bell. An artist’s conception of the Defiant X compound helicopter., Boeing-Lockheed Martin “We are ready to deliver unparalleled capabilities backed by proven technologies that will truly transform the Army’s mission today, with room to grow and adapt to the missions of tomorrow,” Andy Adams, Sikorsky’s Vice President of Future Vertical Lift. “Defiant X not only includes the transformational aircraft – a maneuverable, survivable, lethal weapon system – it also leverages Sikorsky’s and Boeing’s advanced manufacturing capabilities.” The FLRAA program’s primary objective is to develop a replacement for the Army’s UH-60 Black Hawks, such as the one seen here., US Army “Defiant X is purpose-built for a modernized Army that requires expanded reach, survivability, and lethality,” Steve Parker, Vice President and General Manager of Boeing Vertical Lift. “This weapon system will give soldiers unequaled technological advantage and connectivity over adversaries in a multi-domain battle space.” Defiant X has the same general underlying configuration as the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter, a design that first flew in 2019 , with two rigid coaxial rotors and a pusher propeller in the tail. Compound helicopters typically offer higher top speeds and improved maneuverability over traditional helicopters. The SB>1 has so far demonstrated an ability to reach a top speed of 211 knots in level flight and hit 232 knots while in a shallow dive. The Defiant X and the SB>1 both owe much to technology Sikorsky first proved out with the X2 demonstrator helicopter, starting in 2008, and that is also found on the company’s S-97 Raider light helicopter design. You can read more about these developments and the general benefits of this design in this past War Zone piece . “With its rigid coaxial rotor system and pusher propeller, Defiant X incorporates Sikorsky X2 Technology™ to operate at high speeds while maintaining low-speed handling qualities,” Lockheed Martin said in its press release. “This critical capability provides soldiers with increased maneuverability and survivability in high-threat air defense environments, allowing them to penetrate enemy defenses while reducing exposure to enemy fire.” The external outline of the Defiant X also shares distinct similarities with Lockheed Martin’s Raider X , which was derived from the S-97, and might indicate some stealth design considerations. The chines on the nose, which is also more pointed than that of the SB>1, and along the fuselage, as well as the blended engine nacelles, are common low-observable (stealthy) features. Boeing and Sikorsky did previously work together on the abortive RAH-66 Comanche stealth scout helicopter in the 1990s and early 2000s. Raider X had been a contender for the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), another part of the FVL initiative that is seeking to develop a follow-on to the now-retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter. Raider X and Bell’s Invictus helicopter are now competing for that contract. The winning FARA design is slated to supplant the roughly half of the Army’s AH-64 Apache attack helicopter fleet that presently serves in the armed reconnaissance role. A rendering showing Raider Xs, at left, sharing a flight line with Defiant Xs., Lockheed Martin The Defiant X does have some notable changes from the SB>1, as well, including a new tricycle landing gear arrangement, which replaces the first Defiant’s Black Hawk-style configuration of two wheels on either side of the front fuselage and a third wheel under the rear of the tail boom. The new design also has a new integrated mission systems package with “fly-by-wire flight controls integrated with autonomy capability leading to safety and workload reduction for the crew and operations in complex and degraded visual environments,” according to statements from company representatives ahead of the public reveal. An older Lockheed Martin graphic showing how it saw the evolution of the X2 technology demonstrator and the S-97 Raider continuing in the future. The FVL Medium and FVL Light efforts were renamed FLRAA and FARA, respectively., Lockheed Martin No details about exactly what autonomous capabilities were included in this package, but Sikorsky has previously worked with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Army on a program called Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS). ALIAS’ focus was on developing automated systems to help reduce the workload on pilots and other crew members, improve their efficiency and overall operational performance, and provide an additional margin of safety. You can read more about that project in this past War Zone piece . As its name implies, the primary mission of the FLRAA will be long-range airmobile assaults carrying both troops and cargo internally and externally, slung underneath. Concept art that Lockheed Martin and Boeing have released of the Defiant X shows the helicopters carrying cargo containers and 155mm M777 towed howitzers as an example. An artist’s conception of Defiant Xs carrying M777 howitzers and other cargo slung underneath their fuselages., Boeing-Lockheed Martin “One of the key words here is versatility,” Heather McBryan, Boeing’s Director of Sales and Marketing for Future Vertical Lift, had said at a gathering ahead of today’s official announcement. “Although the FLRAA mission is about more than just flying fast, and although we know the pacing mission is the air assault mission, this aircraft is going to be asked to do a whole lot of other things on a daily basis and our design and capability really provides that extreme lifting power for those types of missions.” The Army is also eying the winning FLRAA design as a replacement for at least some of the specially-configured MH-60L/M helicopters assigned to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). Requirements that the service laid out in 2018 also included discussion of a potential configuration for the U.S. Marine Corps . There is already reportedly significant foreign interest in the FLRAA competition, including within NATO , which makes good sense given how many countries worldwide operate UH-60s, or other similarly-sized helicopters, that are also, in many cases, increasingly in need of replacement . NATO is also now looking at a potential intra-European design to meet these requirements. The Army’s current goal is to issue a formal request for proposals for the FLRAA program before the end of the 2021 Fiscal Year on Sept. 30 and pick a winner sometime in the subsequent 2022 Fiscal Year. The hope is that the first examples will enter operational service by 2030. It remains to be seen exactly what Bell’s offering will look like, but just as Defiant X is based on the SB>1 Defiant, its proposal will likely be derived directly from the tilt-rotor V-280 Valor and based on its own experience in the JMR technology demonstration effort. With the public reveal of Defiant X, we will see Bell’s pitch sooner, rather than later, and learn more about both designs as the Army moves closer to starting the formal FLRAA competition later this year.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2020",The United Kingdom Has Chosen Who Will Build Its First Prototype Loyal Wingman Combat Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United Kingdom expects to have a prototype loyal wingman-type unmanned aircraft in the air by 2023, the Royal Air Force has confirmed, and the service announced today that a contract for the aircraft had been placed with the chosen industry prime. Northern Ireland-based Spirit AeroSystems will design and manufacture a prototype “uncrewed fighter aircraft” in its new role at the head of Project Mosquito, an effort to develop drones capable of working together semi-autonomously with manned aircraft, which The War Zone discussed in detail last year . The deal that Spirit AeroSystems just received is worth 30 million pounds, or approximately just under $41 million, at the rate of exchange at the time of writing, and expected to wrap up in three years. Once the company has designed and built a technology demonstrator under Project Mosquito, a decision will be taken on whether to launch a follow-on program to yield a production version. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost unmanned aircraft that, before the end of this decade, could potentially work together with the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) Eurofighter Typhoons and F-35B Lightnings , as well as the Tempest future stealth fighter jet that’s also now under development. The British loyal wingman will be expected to offer its piloted counterparts added “protection, survivability, and information as it flies alongside.” Rendering of UK’s loyal wingman drone., UK MOD In a press release today the U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) also revealed more details of how it expects its future loyal wingman to operate. The drones will “fly at high speed alongside fighter jets” and will carry “missiles, surveillance and electronic warfare technology.” The aircraft will be expected to target and shoot down enemy aircraft and “survive against surface-to-air missiles.” “We’re taking a revolutionary approach, looking at a game-changing mix of swarming drones and uncrewed fighter aircraft like Mosquito, alongside piloted fighters like Tempest, that will transform the combat battlespace in a way not seen since the advent of the jet age,” declared Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston, Chief of the Air Staff. As well as these details, the MOD today released a new digitally generated concept artwork of a loyal wingman design, seen at the top of this story, flying alongside an F-35B, although it’s unclear if this represents the Project Mosquito technology demonstrator, or a follow-on production version. Either way — and however notional this concept is — it is broadly similar to the models displayed by the Royal Air Force and MOD at the 2019 Royal International Air Tattoo, shown below. Models of notional loyal wingman drones seen on display at the 2019 Royal International Air Tattoo., DTSL The latest concept retains the relatively narrow fuselage with swept wings and a v-tail, although the flying surfaces have become larger and the wings now feature prominent downward-canted tips. The low-observable features, including a dorsal air intake and fuselage chine line, are retained, while the exhaust seems to feature a serrated nozzle . Project Mosquito is a part of the RAF’s Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) concept. LANCA was launched in 2015 by the MOD’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) executive agency and is intended to “understand innovative Combat Air technologies and concepts that offer radical reductions in cost and development time.” While it’s managed by Dstl, LANCA — including Project Mosquito — is led by the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO). In turn, LANCA falls under a wider project, the Future Combat Air System Technology Initiative (FCAS TI), which also includes the Tempest future manned fighter. Last November , Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that FCAS TI would be among the beneficiaries of additional investment into defense research and development. As announced by the Prime Minister in November 2020, the entire FCAS program is set to benefit from a portion of additional planned investment into military research and development, totaling 1.5 billion pounds, or around $2 billion. Earlier LANCA concept art., DSTL Spirit AeroSystems has emerged to lead the Project Mosquito design and prototyping effort after the transfer of Bombardier’s Northern Ireland division to U.S.-based Spirit AeroSystems was sealed last October . Originally, the Belfast division of Bombardier Aerospace and Northrop Grumman UK had come together as a consortium known as Black Dawn, which was led by Callen-Lenz . This grouping was one of three entrants in the first phase of the project, competing with Boeing and another team led by Blue Bear Systems Research. While it has been confirmed that Northrop Grumman UK remains part of a team that is now led by Spirit AeroSystems, there was no mention in the press release, or by the RAF, of Callen-Lenz, suggesting this company is no longer be involved. If so, that might also explain why the bid is no longer named Black Dawn. With all its experience in developing the Airpower Teaming System (ATS) for the Australian government, it might have been expected that Boeing would have been the front-runner to design a new loyal wingman for the U.K., but it may yet find a role within LANCA, too, and Australia has permitted Boeing to share ATS data with the UK. In the past, the MOD said it had not ruled out awarding new contracts to more than one of the three Project Mosquito contenders. The MOD has also said that the latest contract will support more than 100 jobs in Belfast. This, of course, is also good news for Northern Ireland’s economy, which, in the wake of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (E.U.), faces particular challenges due to its special status including its border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the E.U. “[The contract for Spirit AeroSystems] is fantastic news and underlines the distinct strengths in Northern Ireland’s economy, through its advanced engineering and manufacturing capabilities,” said Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis. “This ground-breaking project will involve a significant investment, which will not only support local employment but also reinforce Northern Ireland’s contribution to the security of our nation,” he added. The plan is to start flight testing of a full-scale Project Mosquito vehicle by the end of 2023 and the MOD has said it will harness an unconventional approach to achieve this. In particular, the defense ministry has said it will use “the latest software development techniques and civilian aerospace engineering and manufacturing expertise.” The expectation is that this will not only speed the path to frontline service but also bring a reduction in costs. The fact that the drone is expected to carry “missiles, surveillance and electronic warfare technology” points to a modular design, in which the vehicle can be rapidly reconfigured to perform different roles, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and strike missions. An infographic for the future Tempest fighter jet, including modular payloads, which will also likely feature in Project Mosquito., BAE Systems Interestingly, the latest MOD press release does not mention any swarming capability , although in the past it has been expected that this would be included. Indeed, the MOD is known to be looking at the feasibility of developing swarms of smaller drones and the RAF has now established a dedicated drone development unit , No 216 Squadron. British ambitions to field swarming drones may also tie in with Italian defense contractor Leonardo’s recent demonstration in cooperation with the RAF of an autonomous swarm of unmanned aircraft, each carrying a variant of its BriteCloud expendable active decoy as an electronic warfare payload. Using the BriteClouds, which contain electronic warfare jammers, the drones were able to launch a mock non-kinetic attack on radars acting as surrogates for a notional enemy integrated air defense network. This work also involved Callen-Lenz, which was originally part of the Black Dawn team, as well as Blue Bear Systems Research. You can read more about the trials here . The RAF’s Protector program is also progressing. This effort is set to provide the service with a more capable successor to its Reaper remotely piloted medium-altitude, long-endurance drone. Together with all this, Project Mosquito — and the wider LANCA initiative — is an indication that the United Kindom is increasingly embracing an unmanned future. Now that a prime contractor has been selected for Project Mosquito, we hopefully won’t have long to wait until we see the first of the country’s loyal wingman drones.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Putin Has Created The Ultimate Bond Villain’s Lair,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earlier this week, an absolutely massive investigation dropped regarding a highly intriguing site on Russia’s Black Sea coast referred to as the Residence at Cape Idokopas or, more commonly, Putin’s Palace, after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The extremely high-security estate, which covers an area just over 168 acres near the resort town of Gelendzhik, reportedly belongs to Putin, though a web of associates and shell companies. It’s a totally unique, if not puzzling installation that many have kept a close eye on for years. Now, this new report offers unprecedented insight into where it came from and what it actually includes. The Anti-Corruption Foundation , also known by its Russian acronym FBK, released the investigative report, which is presently available only in Russian , but is still well worth exploring in full, on Jan. 19, 2021. It is based heavily on financial records and other documents the organization obtained from various sources. It also includes never-before-seen exterior views of the property, including its Italian-style palace, ice rink, amphitheater, and more, as well as highly detailed interior depictions of what the main residence might eventually look like based on floor plans obtained from a whistleblower showing opulent amenities, including a huge pool, a theater, a casino, and a lounge with a pole-dancing stage, among others. FBK estimates that the entire estate, which it says also has features that feel more appropriate for a villain in a James Bond movie, including an escape tunnel, is worth approximately just under $1.4 billion. The reality is that its real worth is more or less unquantifiable, as nothing else exists really like it, outside of the likes of North Korea possibly. Even then, executing a project of this magnitude, at least in qualitative terms, would be challenging due to the tight sanctions placed on that country. An aerial view of Putin’s Palace on the Black Sea., FBK FBK is a Russian non-profit organization that seeks to expose corruption among government officials and that has been highly critical of Putin. There is strong evidence that FBK’s founder, Alexei Navalny, was the target of a Russian government assassination attempt last year involving one of a secretive family of chemical weapons, known collectively as Novichoks . Navalny was eventually medically evacuated to Germany, where he recovered. The day before his team put the palace investigation online, he had returned to Russia, where he was summarily arrested on highly questionable grounds relating to a suspended prison sentence from 2014 and charges of libel against a World War II veteran. Putin’s personal spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report as “pure nonsense ,” reiterating the Russian government’s long-standing position that Putin has no connection whatsoever to the site. However, media reports and whistleblower allegations over the past decade have provided evidence that Russia’s President has been tied to the estate on the Cape Idokopas since at least 2000 . A satellite image of the core of the estate as of August 2019. The actual ornate palace itself is at the southern end, toward the coast., Google Earth Despite Russian’s government insistence that Putin has no links to the palace and the rest of the estate, it’s certainly protected as if he does. For years now, journalists and activists attempting to get close to the site, by land and by sea, have reported being warded off by members of Russia’s Federal Protective Service and the Federal Security Service , known by the acronyms FSO and FSB, respectively. Both of these government organizations trace their origins to branches of the Soviet-era KGB. During its latest investigation, Navalny’s team turned up an official flight chart showing a box of restricted airspace, labeled URP116, around Putin’s Palace, prohibiting anything from flying through at any altitude between Flight Level 130, or 13,000 feet, and the ground. FBK also says that the actual size of the estate is around 100 times larger if one includes a nearly 17,300-acre adjacent plot of land that the FSB reportedly owns. The report adds that in September 2020 this land was leased to the firm that officially owns the Residence at Cape Idokopas through 2068, ostensibly “for scientific research and educational activities, hunting, and fishing.” The flight chart that FBK obtained showing the block of restricted airspace, URP116, over Putin’s Palace in the lower right-hand corner., via FBK An annotated satellite map showing the estate, highlighted in reddish-orange at the bottom, and the larger adjacent plot of land reportedly owned by the FSB, highlighted in lighter orange., FBK All of this notwithstanding, FBK says it was able to fly a small drone with a video camera over the estate, which it has now dubbed Putin’s Kingdom. That footage provides the most detailed publicly available look at the property in years. The palace, which looks fit for a tsar, is, of course, one of the most prominent structures. It alone occupies an area of around 17,691 square meters, or approximately 190,424 square feet, according to FBK. Navalny’s team says that costs associated with this building have grown substantially over the years. High humidity in the region, combined with faulty ventilation systems, led to serious mold problems that needed remediation. The palace has been under perpetual construction for many years. A view of the estate from the sea with the palace prominently visible in the center., FBK Another view of Putin’s Kingdom., FBK The palace is just one of a number of structures on the property, though, some of which appear to also still be under construction to varying degrees. FBK identified what it said was a greenhouse, as well as an outdoor amphitheater. A very long bridge connects what Navalny’s team said was a tea house to the central area of the sprawling installation. A number of the buildings appear to have been built and rebuilt over and over again, pointing to a very demanding owner with limitless financial resources. There are also various buildings that appear to be offices and dormitories. This is not surprising given that the entire estate undoubtedly requires an equally massive staff and on-site security team. Putin and his staff might have a need for additional, more specialized office space outside of the main residence, as well, to conduct any necessary work, including on particularly sensitive issues, or to serve as a more robust command center during a crisis. There is a very prominent radio tower on this section of the property, as well.

Of the other structures within Putin’s Kingdom, a building with a sloping, grass-covered roof that was built on the site of what had been a trio of helipads is perhaps the most interesting. The footage from FBK shows that two new helipads have now been built directly adjacent to it. FBK has identified this building as an ice rink, which is hardly surprising given Putin’s well-known fondness for hockey . The grass-covered ice rink. One of two new helipads is visible to the left., FBK The other side of the ice rink., FBK The video below shows Putin playing hockey during an exhibition match in 2019 in which he scored eight goals. He also infamously fell while taking a victory lap at the end of the game. During the construction of this building, which began in 2018, there had been some speculation that this could be a hardened underground bunker for Putin in the event of a major crisis. There was renewed discussion about this possibility in November 2020, after the Russian President disclosed the completion of a new bunker at an undisclosed location that he said could withstand a nuclear attack. The new aerial imagery shows that the building, which FBK has identified as an indoor ice rink, is only semi-buried.

FBK analyzed those documents and had detailed 3D renderings made of the rooms based on their assessments of what would likely be inside, at least when everything is finished, which were also based on other pictures and documents offering potential details about specific high-end furnishings. via FBK via FBK via FBK The interior renderings of one of the bedrooms, an adjacent bathroom, and living and reading rooms, show an aesthetic that is certainly in-line with the exterior look of the building.

Some were less clear, though. For instance, one room was marked “hookah,” suggesting it was a lounge where individuals could smoke, including using one of those water pipes . “All would be fine, but in the ‘hookah’ there is not a single window, but for some reason there is a stage, a dressing room, spotlights, and something very similar to a pole is noted on the plan,” according to the investigation. “We thought for a long time what it could be. Perhaps a giant shawarma is prepared here. Or firefighters are training,” the report quips. “And here’s what happened,” it continues. The accompanying rendering makes it pretty clear what Navalny’s team believes this room actually is. A rendering of what the “hookah” room might look like, an aesthetic straight out of a racy nightclub or strip club., FBK The palace itself has Versailles-like grounds, lined with exotic trees and ringed with huge sculptures. What looks like a roundabout carriage house or some other structure also exists towards the property’s southwest corner that is also quite intriguing. This could also be the elevator access large enough for vehicles to an underground labyrinth. Lastly, but certainly not least, there is the matter of the James Bond-esque escape tunnel that Navalny’s team says links an underground portion of the palace to an exit close to the shoreline. The footage FBK took using its drone certainly shows what could be an exit and a ventilation port for the tunnel system. The apparent exit also comes out on a road along the shore that could be used as a route to escape by land or to get to a nearby dock inside an enclosed harbor, for evacuation by sea. A satellite image of the enclosed harbor with the reported tunnel exit visible just above and to the left of the dock., Google Earth The investigation also found further evidence of the purpose of these features on an archived webpage of a company, Metro Style, which designed subway stations. The page included various architectural plans that it says were for “a complex of underground structures for a boarding house in Gelendzhik, Krasnodar Territory.” A map showing the underground layout of the tunnels and a lateral cross-section both align very well with what is visible externally on the estate. “And this tunnel has a little secret. Do you see something like a door in the second photo?” the investigative report adds. “This is the tasting room. Specially disguised downhill. In fact, it is a huge window that offers the best possible sea view. Here you can enjoy a glass of wine, and, what is most important for our national leader, this is not some kind of balcony where you are constantly in danger, but a very safe underground place where nothing threatens you.” An annotated picture showing what is likely the exit for an escape tunnel underneath Putin’s Palace., FBK This is what FBK says is the “tasting room.”, FBK A map of tunnels that Metro Style worked on “for a boarding house in Gelendzhik.”, Metro Style via The Internet Archive A lateral view of the tunnels that Metro Style worked on, with an annotation that FBK made showing the location of the “tasting room.”, Metro Style via The Internet Archive / FBK While one potential dedicated bunker turned out to be the ice rink, this tunnel system under the main palace could offer a more hardened location to shelter in place, as well. It’s possible, if not plausible that there are other underground facilities on the sprawling property, including an actual purpose-built command and control bunker complex. The FBK investigation makes no other mention of security features at the palace or elsewhere on the estate. One would imagine that they are extensive, but the fact that Navalny’s team was able to fly a small drone – a type of platform that, especially when combined with small munitions, presents a very real threat and has been employed in actual attempted assassinations of world leaders and other government officials around the world in recent years – over the estate has to be at best embarrassing for Russia’s security services. The entire facility is ringed by high-security walls, fencing, and other barriers with fortified checkpoints at its entrances. An improved road network also provides access all over the property and beyond. There are other features that remain totally unexplained, as well. For instance, this massive ramp-like setup that appears to be some sort of vehicle access into an underground facility. It leads to the ever-growing pier area on the southern border of the primary property. Google Earth How the estate, and the restricted areas around it, continue to evolve now remains to be seen. The footage FBK shot shows significant construction ongoing and indications that the site is not yet in regular use, but there are signs that the various facilities may soon be operational. Navalny’s team also says that Putin’s Kingdom is just one of a number of properties linked to the Russian President, including four other sites near Gelendzhik, including another chateau, wineries, and an oyster farm. You can watch FBK’s entire presentation on this bizarre facility and those surrounding it below: What will happen to Putin, who is looking at a new potential wave of protests across the country over Navalny’s arrest, which started yesterday, is also not entirely clear. Just yesterday, Gerogy Alburov, another member of Navalny’s team, who also helped put together a nearly two-hour-long video presentation to accompany the investigative report on Putin’s Kingdom, was jailed for 10 days on unclear charges. That detention would seem to be primarily intended to prevent him from taking to the streets this weekend. Tens of thousands of people have joined protests across Russia, demanding the release of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny who was jailed last week after he returned to the country for the first time since recovering from a poisoning with a nerve agent. https://t.co/fpPSEQYs2X pic.twitter.com/YVyT7b7DT7 — ABC News (@ABC) January 23, 2021 State Department spox “strongly condemns the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia.” pic.twitter.com/uBkbKSi9kF — John Hudson (@John_Hudson) January 23, 2021 There are also persistent rumors that the Russian President, who is 68, may have serious health issues, including the early stages of Parkinson’s disease or cancer, but the authorities in the country have vehemently denied this and there is no hard evidence to confirm any of the claims. At the same time, in December 2020, Putin did sign a bill into law granting lifetime legal immunity to former Russian presidents, which could indicate that he does not actually expect to be in power forever, any health issues notwithstanding. Dmitry Medvedev is the only living former Russian president and did not appear to be at any risk of imminent prosecution at the time the law was passed. All told, the Residence at Cape Idokopas certainly offers Putin an opulent place to escape from the business of running Russia while still being able to run the country if need be, but it could also become an extravagant retirement home for the long-time Russian leader some time down the line. Regardless of its final reason for being, securing its existence is certainly a high priority for the Russian government. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
The War Zone staff,"Posted on Dec 15, 2020",Air Force Eyes Drones For Adversary And Light Attack Roles As It Mulls Buying New F-16s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is in the midst of a major review of its tactical aircraft fleets. This includes investigating the possibility of using drones equipped with the artificial intelligence-driven systems being developed under the Skyborg program as red air adversaries during training, and potentially in the light attack role . The service is also exploring a potential purchase of new F-16 fighter jets, likely based on the Block 70/72 variant , two decades after the service ordered its last Vipers as it shifted focus to the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter. In an interview with Steve Trimble, Aviation Week ’s Defense Editor and good friend of The War Zone , earlier this month, which you can find here , now-former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Will Roper, provided insight into the ongoing tactical aircraft review, including particularly intriguing comments about forthcoming unmanned aircraft system programs and buying additional F-16s. These and other ideas are being scrutinized as the service looks toward its Fiscal Year 2023 budget request, which, barring any complications, would be unveiled in the spring of 2022. F-16s from the Wisconsin Air National Guard alongside an F-35A, the type that is due to replace them. Now, the Air Force is also weighing up the options of buying new F-16s., U.S. Air Force/Scott Wolff Roper had been the chief architect and advocate of the Air Force’s Skyborg program, which the service revealed in 2019, and is developing a suite of new autonomous capabilities for unmanned aircraft with a heavy focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. The service has said that the goal is to first integrate these technologies into lower-cost loyal wingman type drones designed to work together with manned aircraft, but that this new “computer brain” might eventually control fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , or UCAVs. The Skyborg effort has been heavily linked to other Air Force programs that are exploring unmanned aircraft designs that are “attritable.” This means that they would be cheap enough for commanders to be more willing to operate these drones in riskier scenarios where there might be a higher than average probability of them not coming back. With this in mind, Skyborg technology has previously been seen as ideal for unmanned aircraft operating in higher-threat combat environments. However, in the interview with Aviation Week , Roper suggested that they might also first serve in an adversary role . In this way, these unmanned aggressors would test combat aircrew, either standing in for swarms of enemy drones or conducting the kinds of mission profiles for which an autonomous control system would be better suited. As the proliferation of advanced drone capabilities continues, adversary drone training systems will become a pressing capability. Even using drones to stand in for or augment manned adversary platforms is one of the potential solutions to the problem of needing far more targets in the air at one time to stress fleet pilots. Operating huge fleets of manned adversaries is highly cost-prohibitive. For example, Air Combat Command shortlisted seven companies for a combined total of $6.4 billion of potential aggressor contract work in 2019; details of the first five bases to receive this support were revealed last year, as The War Zone reported at the time . Other solutions, including augmented reality, are being looked at to solve this problem, as well. You can read more about this issue in this past exclusive of ours. “I think, at a minimum, attritables ought to take on the adversary air mission as the first objective,” Roper said. “We pay a lot of money to have people and planes to train against that do not go into conflict with us. We can offload the adversary air mission to an artificially intelligent system that can learn and get better as it’s doing its mission.” Roper’s specific mention here of attritable drones is interesting and could perhaps hint that the manned aircraft they would battle with might, at least on some occasions, also shoot them down. If that were to become a reality, it would provide pilots with a highly realistic element to their training that would potentially be far more valuable than the relatively “canned” type of live-fire gunnery or missile firing that they are exposed to today. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is already in the midst of an effort, separate from Skyborg, to develop an autonomous unmanned aircraft that uses AI-driven systems with the goal of having it duel with a human pilot in an actual fighter jet by 2024. A Draken International pilot prepares to fly an A-4K Skyhawk at Kinston Regional Jetport, North Carolina, September 11, 2020. Contractors are adding additional red air capacity, but their aircraft cannot provide the highest level of capabilities., U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Kimberly Barrera Roper also clearly sees the use of drones equipped with the Skyborg suite of systems as a potential way to bring down the cost of the entire red air training enterprise, reducing the requirement to procure more expensive manned aircraft and teach the instructors required to fly them. Beyond cost-saving, however, there is still a demand for higher-end red air capabilities, especially stealthy ones, that contractors can’t really provide. This is one of the reasons why early-model F-35s have been chosen to equip a future aggressor squadron . While this will go some way to meeting the demand for advanced threat simulation, it is likely to be a limited and costly fleet. Stealthy, but attritable drones, such as the XQ-58 Valkyrie , would certainly be a possibility for adding additional capacity here at a lower cost. A flight of Aggressor F-15s and F-16s. The F-15s are assigned to the now-disbanded 65th Aggressor Squadron that will begin receiving F-35As at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, next year. , U.S. Air Force/Master Sgt. Kevin J. Gruenwald As well as training the human elements, introducing Skyborg-enabled drones into large-force exercises would also help train them , enhancing their own AI algorithms, and building up their capabilities before going into battle for real. Essentially, algorithms need to be tested repeatedly to make sure they are functioning as intended, as well as for the system itself to build up a library of sorts of known responses to inputs. Furthermore, “training” Skyborg-equipped drones in this way in red air engagements inherently points to training them for real air-to-air combat. A conceptual design for a low-cost UCAV that emerged under the Skyborg program., AFRL Air-to-air combat isn’t the only frontline role the Air Force is eying for drones carrying the Skyborg suite. “I think there are low-end missions that can be done against violent extremists that should be explored,” Roper said. This opens up the possibility that lower-cost unmanned aircraft using AI-driven systems could help the Air Force finally adopt a light attack platform after more than a decade of abortive efforts in this regard. Despite initial plans to buy hundreds of aircraft, the service dramatically scaled back its most recent attempt, known as the Light Attack Aircraft program, in 2019. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) subsequently tried to revive the project, but Congress blocked that effort in its annual defense policy bill, or National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), for the 2021 Fiscal Year. A Textron Scorpion above White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, while participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment in 2017., U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula So, there remains a requirement for a light attack platform that could potentially be filled by an advanced unmanned alternative. In the meantime, the Air Force had also attempted to cease buying MQ-9 Reaper drones, which currently undertake many of these types of lower-end combat missions , but this was ultimately blocked by Congress , too. Still, close air support (CAS) is a mission that still benefits hugely from a human in the cockpit. As such, the exact capability set of a semi-autonomous drone, in this regard, may be limited. One could imagine giving the targeting control directly to those the drone is tasked with supporting on the ground though. This could compress the kill-chain and help with providing CAS in contested environments where a stealthy and attritable airframe may be overtly beneficial. Just such a concept was floated by the then Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, who described it as “a flying Coke machine.” You can read all about that in this past article of ours. Roper had also indicated in his interview that perhaps the cost-savings from using drones in the adversary role might free up funds to otherwise address the light attack issue, as well as other needs the Air Force might have. Replacing “adversary air [with attritable unmanned aircraft] would save us money up front,” Roper explained. With regards to manned tactical aircraft, Roper also revealed in the interview that the Air Force is looking at new purchases of F-16s. “As you look at the new F-16 production line in South Carolina , that system has some wonderful upgraded capabilities that are worth thinking about as part of our capacity solution,” he said. Roper was almost certainly referring to the latest Block 70/72 variants of the F-16C/D that Lockheed Martin has been successfully selling on the export market in recent years. The company also offers an upgrade package to bring existing Vipers up to a similar configuration, known as the F-16V . In September 2020, the defense giant announced plans to standardize its F-16 offerings around a base model derived from the Block 70/72 configuration, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . New Vipers based on this standardized model are what the Air Force would likely be looking to buy in Fiscal Year 2023 or beyond. The latest Block 70/72 jets are already highly capable , featuring sophisticated avionics, mission systems, active electronically scanned array radar, extended range, and a digital electronic warfare suite. In the meantime, the Air Force is working hard to wring the most out of existing F-16 inventory, updating many with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) and the new electronic warfare package from the Block 70/72. Maintenance personnel installing mounting hardware for a SABR radar on a 416th Flight Test Squadron F-16., U.S. Air Force/Christopher Okula The Air Force has already committed to buying new F-15EX fighter jets to top up its current tactical fleet, but additional orders for the F-16 — which first flew back in 1974 — had not previously been talked about publicly. The idea of purchasing additional advanced fourth-generation aircraft seems to be driven in large part by concerns that the production rate for the fifth-generation F-35A might not keep pace with demand. Right now, at least officially, the Air Force still plans to buy 1,763 F-35As as part of the Department of Defense’s most expensive weapons program ever. “I expect you’ll see other trades in terms of numbers of F-35s, up or down, and capability mixes with Block 4 vs. things one might do with F-15EX or NGAD,” Roper told Aviation Week . NGAD is the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program, which is taking a system-of-systems approach to developing future aerial combat capabilities, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . In September 2020, Roper said that some form of NGAD prototype had already flown, something he reiterated in an op-ed for Popular Mechanics that was published earlier this month. “I think it’s [the F-35A] a long way from being an affordable fighter that we can buy in bulk,” Roper also told reporters during a roundtable event on January 14. “That’s why other tactical aviation options are appealing to have in the mix, so that the Air Force has options.” Two USAF F-16s in formation with two Royal Saudi Air Force F-15S Strike Eagles, over Southwest Asia, December 15, 2020. For some years, advanced export-standard F-15s and F-16s have surpassed some of the capabilities of their USAF counterparts, but with the F-15EX and potential new F-16 orders, that could change., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Taylor Harrison All of this is not necessarily new. Last December Aviation Wee k reported that the Air Force had, back in 2018, prepared a study that called for Air Force F-35A orders to be trimmed from the planned 1,763 to 1,050. While it’s true that unit prices for all F-35 variants have continued to drop since then, concerns have grown about the sustainment costs of the jets. As of 2019, the U.S. military estimated it would cost $1.196 trillion just to operate and maintain the full planned fleets of F-35s across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy through 2070. With these issues, coupled with a legacy fleet of tactical fighters that is aging fast, the F-16 presents a rapid and potentially cost-effective way of boosting the Air Force’s tactical aviation capacity in the near term. As Roper noted, the F-16 is still in production for export customers in South Carolina, so the jets could be readily available, provided that production slots can be reserved. What is more, the F-16 is very well-established in the Air Force, meaning the jets could slot more readily into existing logistics and support chains and make use of more existing infrastructure and training processes. In addition, the ability of advanced versions of legacy fighters, such as the F-15, and to a lesser extent the F-16, to be adapted to carry new and varied weapons and sensors is compelling in its own right to airpower commanders as a compliment to new fifth-generation types. They can also typically carry heavier weapons loads than fifth-generation designs, allowing them to serve as “bomb trucks” to support their stealthy counterparts. The War Zone has highlighted the value of this high-low mix in the past with regards to the F-15EX specifically. A computer-generated artwork of the F-15EX, providing some idea of its additional weapons carriage potential., Boeing Ultimately, depending on how future budgets pan out, the Air Force could even find itself placing orders for both F-16 Block 70/72s and F-15EXs, as well as stealthy F-35As and, before long, a new stealthy combat aircraft, manned or not, under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The existence of at least some kind of prototype or developmental testbed for NGAD was revealed by Roper last September. One issue that this kind of planning does throw up is the viability of buying both F-16s and F-35s for the Air Force simultaneously. Even plans to buy the F-15EX faced criticism for their potential knock-on effect on F-35 orders and since both the F-16 and F-35 are Lockheed Martin products, that problem could become even more acute. An F-35A lands while an F-16C prepares for takeoff, December 15, 2020, at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. , U.S. Air Force/Airman 1st Class Brooke Moeder Regardless, with orders for all those aircraft becoming a real prospect, it raises the possibility of the Air Force facing a future where it is flying F-15s, F-16s, F-22, F-35s, and A-10s, plus Skyborg drones and maybe even first-gen NGAD aircraft, as well as UCAVs , simultaneously. All those different fleets would represent a very expensive tactical aircraft enterprise. That is, of course, unless it is able to divest certain fleets wholesale, as it has planned, but previous efforts in this direction have sometimes ended in failure. While the Air Force will no doubt hope that the kind of advances in acquisition and program management that Roper so espoused, coupled with bleeding-edge production technologies, will help bring down the costs of its next-generation combat aircraft, it would seem clear that there could still be a place for manned tactical fighters like the F-15 and F-16 for many years to come. In fact, this scenario almost starts to look something like the “ Digital Century Series ” that Roper promoted in the past — in which smaller numbers of aircraft are produced quickly to meet dynamically evolving threats. The same concept could also potentially be used to balance the mix between high-end fighters like the F-35 and NGAD, and low-end counterparts like the F-15 and F-16, in order to make the most of the available budget. At the same time, beyond Roper’s vision, the Air Force brass has continued to talk about cutting entire legacy aircraft fleets in order to invest in newer capabilities. So, Roper’s ideas do not exactly square with the prevailing view that has persisted at least among many of the Air Force’s upper management in recent years. A Lockheed Martin concept for a next-generation stealthy fighter., Lockheed Martin Whatever happens next, it seems certain now that the Air Force program of record for the F-35A could change, depending also on the rate at which these jets can be built and the cost of their sustainment, both of which remain unclear long-term. But whatever the Air Force chooses to buy, the question remains of how the new Biden administration will deal with the defense budget , after increases in defense spending over the last three years under the Trump administration. While Roper may now have resigned his position, the Air Force is clearly still wrestling with how its future tactical fleet should be shaped, and what the manned/unmanned and high/low mixes will eventually look like.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 27, 2021",Iranian Supreme Leader’s Tweet Suggests A Revenge Drone Assassination Of A Golfing Trump,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An image highly suggestive of a drone targeting former U.S. President Donald Trump on a golf course in a “vengeance” strike in retaliation for the death of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani led Twitter to ban an account for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today. The U.S. military killed Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq in January 2020, which had already prompted public threats from Iranian officials, including against Trump specifically . Twitter took action to suspend the @khamenei_site account around 15 hours after the post with the image first appeared on January 21, 2020. Another official account, @Khamenei_tv, currently remains publicly visible. The same post was also removed from the Supreme Leader’s page on Instagram , which Facebook owns, but that account also remains accessible to the public. The image, which is now circulating widely online, remained visible for a while longer on the Twitter account of Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news outlet, before being taken down there, as well. The offending image depicts what appears to be the shadow of one of Iran’s flying wing-type unmanned aircraft — designs that are supposedly derived, at least in its shape, from a captured U.S. RQ-170 stealth drone — some of which are capable of dropping small munitions , looming over a figure that seems clearly intended to represent Trump as he takes a swing on a golf course. On his first day out of the White House, Trump headed to the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach , Florida. While the image is presumably not expected to be taken entirely literally, it is worth remembering that using a drone to assassinate a leader is not restricted to the realms of fantasy. Indeed, back in 2018, The War Zone examined in detail just such an assassination attempt on the Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro. This, though unsuccessful, proved that the threat posed, in particular, by small drones is very real and is only likely to grow as we enter the era of the “ drone swarm .” The Iranian Shahed-161, from a family of flying-wing drones allegedly reverse-engineered from the RQ-170. , via Twitter The apparent anti-Trump image also includes text , in Farsi, that says “Vengeance: Soleimani’s murderer and he who ordered it will have to pay,” with the first word written in red. In December 2020, Khamenei declared that “revenge is certain” over Soleimani’s death. The Supreme Leader’s remark came ahead of the first anniversary of the U.S. drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, then head of the Quds Force, the division of Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for militant and terrorist activities outside of the country. via Twitter “Those who ordered the murder of General Soleimani as well as those who carried this out should be punished. This revenge will certainly happen at the right time,” Khamenei tweeted on December 16 last year, although he did not specifically mention Trump, who had ordered the strike. “Do not presume that someone, as the president of America, who appeared as a murderer or ordered a murder, may be immune from justice being carried out. Never,” Ebrahim Raisi, Chief Justice of Iran, said during a more recent event on New Year’s Day . “Those who had a role in this assassination and crime will not be safe on Earth.” “It’s even possible that there are people inside your home [the United States] that will respond to your crime,” Esmail Ghaani, who became head of the Quds Force after Soleimani’s death, had said at the same gathering. At the time of the drone strike, the then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Soleimani posed an “imminent” threat and that his assassination had “saved American lives.” “At my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani,” Trump said in a statement following the strike . Days after the U.S. drone strike, Iran retaliated with a ballistic missile attack launched against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. While no U.S. troops were killed in the raid, more than 100 were treated for traumatic brain injury. However, despite a strongly worded threat from Trump, there was no direct U.S. military response to the raids.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. REPRINTED BY PERMISSION While talk of “revenge” for the killing of Soleimani has been a recurrent motif ever since the drone strike, there was no retaliatory action on the anniversary of the assassination. As a deterrent to possible Iranian action, the U.S. military stepped up its activities in the Persian Gulf region, including regular overflights by B-52 bombers and the rare announcement of the deployment of one of its four Ohio class guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, through the highly strategic and often tense Strait of Hormuz . USS Georgia passed through the Strait of Hormuz on December 21, 2020, accompanied by two Ticonderoga class cruisers, USS Port Royal and USS Philippine Sea . , U.S. Navy The use of a drone as part of the imagery posted by Khamenei and elsewhere follows large-scale military drills held in Iran in recent weeks, which focused on unmanned systems and missiles, including some previously unseen weapons. The maneuvers included launching medium-range ballistic missiles over 1,000 miles into the Indian Ocean in a claimed anti-ship ballistic missile test , the missiles coming down 100 miles from the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group . Among the new unmanned capabilities showcased was a drone-launched Sidewinder missile clone that reportedly successfully brought down an aerial target . Meanwhile, Tehran’s war of words with the United States shows little sign of abating despite Trump leaving office. After President Joe Biden was sworn in on January 20, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh called for action and “not just words” in a Twitter post, adding that “The world knows that only the US can fix itself.” Prior to being suspended by Twitter — a fate that also befell Trump himself, earlier this month , after his supporters stormed the Capitol — Khamenei had also had a recent close call with the microblogging platform. On January 9, Twitter removed a post of Khamenei that erroneously suggested that U.S. and British-made vaccines against COVID-19 were “completely untrustworthy” and that “It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations.” The backdrop to these ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States include Trump’s decision in 2018 to walk away from the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions . Instead, Washington reimposed sanctions that have had a significant effect on the Iranian economy and which have in turn been used by the Iranian regime to mobilize hostility toward the United States. However, Biden has said that Washington could rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran resumes strict compliance. Whatever course relations between Iran and the United States take under President Biden, it seems that the shadow of the Trump administration might remain present in more ways than one.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 8, 2020",Executive Order Takes Aim At Foreign-Made Drones And Incursions Over Sensitive Sites,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Airspace security has become a more pressing defense issue over the last decade as unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, have continued to proliferate. The War Zone has reported extensively on these incursions, including some over our most sensitive infrastructure sites and critical defense installations . In an attempt to address this new security threat, then-President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on January 18, 2021, titled “Executive Order on Protecting The United States From Certain Unmanned Aircraft Systems.” The order restricts and excludes drone technologies from countries deemed adversarial, while also instructing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to update its policies concerning airspace over sensitive infrastructure sites. The original text of the order is no longer visible on the White House’s website due to the recent Presidential transition, but an archived version can be viewed here . The primary aim of the Executive Order is to “prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to procure UAS that present unacceptable risks and are manufactured by, or contain software or critical electronic components from, foreign adversaries, and to encourage the use of domestically produced UAS.” To that end, the order instructs all heads of executive branch departments and agencies to conduct thorough reviews of current UAS technologies and suppliers to ensure there are no threats from technologies built by adversary countries. Power-Eng.com The order defines “adversary country” as “the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, or, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce, any other foreign nation, foreign area, or foreign non-government entity engaging in long-term patterns or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to the national or economic security of the United States.” The order bans the federal use of any UAS systems or technologies from any of those countries including: electronic components, flight controllers, ground control system processors, radios, digital transmission devices, cameras, sensors, or gimbals; operating systems and other UAS-related software including mobile applications, and even “network connectivity or data storage located outside the United States, or administered by any entity domiciled in an adversary country.” Various agencies of the U.S. government have been highlighting the potential security risks of using Chinese-made drones for years now, with a heavy focus on concerns about what information the manufacturers collect through their products after they’re sold. In 2017, the U.S. Army went so far as to ban the use of any drones from Chinese firm DJI. Last year, the Trump Administration placed DJI, one of the world’s largest drone manufacturers, on the Commerce Department’s Entity List of blacklisted companies from which American companies are banned from exporting technology. In January 2020, the Department of the Interior (DOI) had also grounded its UAS fleet in January 2020 until certain “cybersecurity, technology and domestic production concerns are adequately addressed.” Those concerns also stemmed from the fact that the DOI’s fleet of over 800 drones was manufactured in China or used parts manufactured in China. So-called “backdoor” exploits have become a chief cybersecurity and infrastructure threat , as it remains unknown to what extent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could leverage Chinese-made hardware to access or affect American networks and systems that depend upon it. Similar issues led the Trump Administration, as well as Congress, to push back against the use of Chinese technology in the establishment of 5G mobile phone and WiFi networks at home and abroad . In addition, the January 18 Executive Order concerning UAS comes in the wake of other policy initiatives and high-profile incidents involving the threat of unfriendly unmanned aerial systems in our skies. More and more civilian and military aircraft are having near misses with drones, while sensitive sites like the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant or the critical THAAD Anti-Ballistic Missile Battery in Guam have had their own recent drone incursions . In late 2019 and early 2020, news spread of reports of unidentified drone swarms in the skies over Colorado and Nebraska, not far from ICBM sites operated by F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The War Zone has been pursuing an investigation into these drone incidents, but so far it seems that even most of America’s civil aviation authorities remain as perplexed by the incursions as we are. Perhaps in response to these unexplained drone incursions and others like it, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a December 2020 report outlining steps that could be taken to mitigate the threat that small UAS pose to sensitive federal sites. A table from CISA’s new drone defense guidelines that outlines the typical threats posed by various types of UAS., CISA This new Executive Order takes the CISA recommendations even further by calling for a review of the existing federal UAS fleet. The reviews called for in the January 18, 2021, Executive Order are extensive. Heads of each agency and department are instructed to review every UAS procurement with which they are involved and determine if each could be ceased: Sec. 2. Reviewing Federal Government Authority to Limit Government Procurement of Covered UAS. (a) The heads of all executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall review their respective authorities to determine whether, and to what extent consistent with applicable law, they could cease: (i) directly procuring or indirectly procuring through a third party, such as a contractor, a covered UAS; (ii) providing Federal financial assistance (e.g., through award of a grant) that may be used to procure a covered UAS; (iii) entering into, or renewing, a contract, order, or other commitment for the procurement of a covered UAS; or (iv) otherwise providing Federal funding for the procurement of a covered UAS. (b) After conducting the review described in subsection (a) of this section, the heads of all agencies shall each submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget identifying any authority to take the actions outlined in subsections (a)(i) through (iv) of this section. Continuing this, the next section of the order requires the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the heads of “other agencies, as appropriate” to submit a report to the President that assesses the risks posed by the current federal UAS fleet: Sec. 3. Reviewing Federal Government Use of UAS. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies shall each submit a report to the Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy describing the manufacturer, model, and any relevant security protocols for all UAS currently owned or operated by their respective agency, or controlled by their agency through a third party, such as a contractor, that are manufactured by foreign adversaries or have significant components that are manufactured by foreign adversaries. (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the heads of other agencies, as appropriate, shall review the reports required by subsection (a) of this section and submit a report to the President assessing the security risks posed by the existing Federal UAS fleet and outlining potential steps that could be taken to mitigate these risks, including, if warranted, discontinuing all Federal use of covered UAS and the expeditious removal of UAS from Federal service. Heads of agencies are instructed to prioritize the costs of replacing any UAS deemed to be a threat into their budgets, and instructs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to work with agency heads to “identify possible sources of funding to replace covered UAS in the Federal fleet in future submissions of the President’s Budget request.” Section 4 of the order deals exclusively with securing airspace over sensitive sites and locations, and instructs the FAA to create new regulations in accordance with its existing UAS safety laws: Sec. 4. Restricting Use of UAS On or Over Critical Infrastructure or Other Sensitive Sites. Within 270 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall propose regulations pursuant to section 2209 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-190). Section 2209 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 can be read in its entirety on the FAA’s website . The section defines certain sensitive sites including “critical infrastructure, such as energy production, transmission, and distribution facilities and equipment,” oil refineries and chemical facilities, amusement parks, and “other locations that warrant such restrictions,” and prohibits and restricts the operation of unmanned aerial systems in close proximity to those sites. Our previous investigation showed that after unexplained drone incursions at the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in 2019, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff discussed how to approach drone incursions, but there was some doubt as to how effective airspace restrictions could be at preventing future incursions. This occurred even after it came to light that dozens of similar incursions had happened over nuclear-related sites in recent years. Homemade munitions carried by an off-the-shelf DJI quadcopter recovered in Iraq in 2017., Sara Hussein/Twitter The War Zone has been reporting on the topic of the threats posed by small drones for years. Actors of all sizes, from peer-rival nation states to drug cartels are weaponizing small drones at an alarming rate, and our ability to defend against these attacks have not yet caught up to the rapid technological advancement these drones have seen in recent years. Executive Orders like this one signed just days ago will force even reluctant government agencies to continue to evaluate what the risks posed by off-the-shelf drones are and what can be done to best mitigate them.

Stephen Walker,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",The Truth About Going From Flying Airplanes To Helicopters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Right off that bat, I’ll tell you helicopters are way cooler and more fun to fly than fixed-wing airplanes. Helicopter operations are much less complex than that of airplanes, but they require a greater skill level and demand more airmanship. Most of a professional fixed-wing pilot’s time is spent in the flight levels above FL180 (Flight Level 180; 18,000 feet). Flying fixed-wing aircraft is arguably more ‘glamorous,’ but no pilot can deny the thrill of low-altitude flight. Working helicopter pilots operate almost exclusively at low-altitude with different scenery and challenges every day. Obstructions such as towers, power lines, and cables across canyons and rivers, as well as constantly morphing ambient atmospheric conditions, present constant challenges to helicopter pilots. It’s an enticing proposition, one that I thankfully latched onto relatively deep into my flying career. Wikicommons/Arpingstone I spent most of my life chasing the dream of flying airplanes. Helicopters were always in my mind as something to explore eventually , but they weren’t my primary focus. While instructing in a Cessna 172, I met a young helicopter pilot in training. We made a general commitment that if we could, we would teach the other and try to get each other commercial certificates. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accommodates the addition of new categories and classes to your pilot certificates without having to start at the lowest level. If you hold a commercial airplane certificate, you can take your first helicopter checkride for a commercial helicopter certificate. It wasn’t a short journey to helicopter certification. Because we were trading ride-along time, I logged the majority of hours I needed by going along for ferry and repositioning flights. By the time I was ready to take the checkride, my helicopter training was a multi-year adventure. Regardless, I relished it and took joy in it every step of the way. One time-building flight brought my instructor and me near Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon in December. Most tourists never get to see the Arizona outback with a light dusting of snow. Another flight involved picking up an R44 at the Robinson factory in Torrance, California. If you’re leaving the Southern Los Angeles basin headed North in a helicopter, you can use the shoreline transition that takes you past Los Angeles International Airport at 50 feet above the waves and within a quarter-mile of the shoreline. The spectacular route takes you along the beach from Redondo to Santa Monica. Most fixed-wing pilots never get to have that kind of fun. The flying and checkride prep is humbling. My first helicopter flight was in a Schweizer S300 , in which I was able to produce a very stable hover after a half-hour of basic instruction. Schweizers are relatively stable and easy to fly, which boosted my confidence and gave me a false sense of what was to come. Everything after that was in a Robinson R44 or R66 . Robinson helicopter flight controls are extremely sensitive. I’m not sure how long it took me to be able to perform all the basic maneuvers in Robinsons, but I know I didn’t hover again for a long time. Masterful Robinson pilots largely, and with exceptions for large corrections, ‘think’ the control stick (called a cyclic) through input movements that are almost imperceptible. It sounds hard and is harder in practice. A Schweizer 300., Pete Markham/Wikicommons Most airplanes are forgiving and stable by design. There are some helicopters that are more stable than others, but there are no forgiving helicopters. No Robinson is inherently stable. They are only as stable as your hands and feet can make them. If you’re an aspiring student helicopter pilot, more likely than not you’ll train in a Robinson. When I started, it became apparent to me there are a million ways to get yourself into trouble in a helicopter. Fixed-wing pilots will recognize ground effect, which happens in helicopters within one-half to a rotor span of the ground, increasing in intensity the lower a helicopter flies or hovers. Ground effect increases lift and performance because downward airflow is reduced to zero at the ground level, which transmits pressure changes to the rotor. Less engine output is required, and helicopters will lift into a hover IGE (in ground effect) even when it’s not safe or appropriate to fly OGE (out of ground effect). Potentially deadly high gross weights and density altitudes can be masked by ground effect in a helicopter. Student pilots learn to perform a power check while hovering IGE before departure. The power check is not a substitution for preflight planning, it’s a last line of defense that references how much manifold pressure or torque you’re using to maintain a hover for the ambient conditions. Helicopter flight manuals generally include tested performance for both IGE and OGE (out of ground effect) hovering. ETL (effective translational lift) is one way helicopter aerodynamics are different. Put into simple terms, when a helicopter is hovering, the main rotor is in its own column of descending air. Greater engine output is required to counteract that column of air. At speeds greater than 16-24 knots, the main rotor is able to ‘bite’ into ‘fresh’ air and ETL is achieved. If the wind is blowing at 25 knots, you can be ‘in’ ETL in a stable hover. Depending on a number of factors, you can get yourself killed in a helicopter by departing a OGE low altitude hover (pushing) downwind. As your speed over the ground begins to match the tailwind, you lose ETL, and lift is suddenly and significantly reduced. The combination of carrying an excessive load and losing ETL while OGE and at low altitude is deadly and has claimed lives. A Robinson R22 hovering. , Jitze Couperus/Wikicommons Most flight schools teach students that ETL is a lifeline. Maneuvers and training are planned around remaining in ETL as much as possible. Departures and arrivals are planned around the parameters in the height/velocity diagram, which is published in the helicopter’s flight manual. Essentially, in training, students push for ETL before climbing out of ground effect, and when landing, they keep ETL until they have descended into ground effect. That practice suits flight training well and increases safety margins. The reality is that most helicopter work, such as that which requires external loads and long lines, is conducted out of ETL. Watch helicopters with a 150-foot line and a firefighting Bambi Bucket. They are hovering OGE to pick up water, and if winds are calm, they are not in ETL. The same goes for helicopters that are lifting air conditioning units to rooftops, or sky cranes lifting and positioning high tension powerline towers. I’ve heard many people repeat that aviation is safer than driving. In context, flying on airliners is safe. Flying helicopters is inherently risky and much more dangerous than driving a car. Safe and proficient utility helicopter pilots are unafraid, but always on guard. They possess a situational awareness most pilots don’t. Fixed-wing pilots routinely train on emergencies with a focus on accuracy in identifying the problem and adherence to the proper published procedure. If you are flying a multi-engine jet and experience an engine failure as you’re lifting off, you focus on flying and maintaining positive control. You calmly climb up to a safe altitude before running the checklist. When an emergency happens in a helicopter, the reaction needs to be instantaneous. If you have an engine failure in a Huey while lifting a utility pole, you’re punching the load off, you’re getting the collective down, you’re counteracting the abrupt yaw moment caused the by rapid rollback of engine torque, and you’re heading to the most suitable landing spot, all at the same time . You’re not calling for a checklist out loud and going over it carefully at a steady pace. Time is simply a luxury you do not have. An MD500 series helicopter working with a powerline maintenance crew. , MD Helicopters It’s my personal observation that helicopter pilots have an easier time transitioning to fixed-wing than fixed-wing pilots do to helicopters. Some of the most difficult fixed-wing flying, like learning taildraggers, comes like a walk in the park to helicopter pilots. One of the first things I did after getting my airplane single-engine land private pilot’s certificate was sought out a local taildragger instructor. I never ground looped a taildragger, but I was working the rudders hard every time I landed or took off in that Cessna 170. Even then the instructor told me what I’d eventually learn: that helicopter pilots come in and have an easy time. I’ll explain why by going over the nuances of helicopter flying in finer detail. In front of a helicopter pilot is the cyclic stick, usually just called the cyclic. Most helicopters have one that comes up from the floor between the pilot’s legs in the right front seat, and usually a second cyclic for a co-pilot. The Robinson has a “teetering” cyclic that comes up from the center of the cabin, reaches over to the right, and hangs above a pilot’s lap. The left-side controls for a potential co-pilot or flight instructor can be removed when they aren’t needed. The cyclic controls the main rotor and, as a result, the direction of flight. Either hydraulically or manually with control rods, the cyclic moves swash plate pitch links located on the main rotor hub assembly that adjust blade pitch. In simple terms, if you want to roll left, you move the cyclic left, and more lift is produced on the right side of the spinning main rotor. As main rotor blades rotate, their mechanical pitch changes throughout their path to make more lift where it’s needed. The same works for moving the cyclic forward and aft. The Robinson R44’s cockpit., DTOM/Wikicommons Stable hovers are a goal for students and the hallmark of professional helicopter pilots. Well built trainer airplanes, such as the perennial Cessna 172, want to fly straight and level. Helicopters do not have a tendency to hover on their own. Pilots hovering a helicopter are executing a delicate balancing act that requires near-constant cyclic input. The ability for pilots to master hovering, which involves many small inputs that happen as we simultaneously use our perception to sense their need, is a testament to the human brain. To the left and near the pilot’s seat is the collective pitch control. The collective is a lever in most helicopters, held in the pilot’s left hand. It, wait for it, ‘collectively’ adjusts the pitch of the main rotor blades, increasing or decreasing overall main rotor thrust. In many helicopters, a correlator increases engine output when you pull the collective up to increase thrust. Some older helicopters do not, and the pilot must twist a throttle, like a motorcycle throttle, on the collective to prevent increased blade pitch from dragging the main rotor RPM down. The pilot’s feet rest on anti-torque pedals. They serve the same purpose as rudder pedals, they control yaw, or left and right movement of the nose around the vertical axis. Control rods from the anti-torque pedals adjust the collective blade pitch, increasing and decreasing tail rotor thrust as necessary to counteract the equal and opposite reaction to the main rotor spinning. This is best illustrated by the available videos of helicopters with tail rotor failures, such as this one . They spin out of control. When a Robinson pilot lowers or raises the collective, they must also apply the appropriate anti-torque pedal that compensates for increased or decreased main rotor torque. More advanced helicopters have systems that offer various levels of anti-torque compensation, as well. The competence helicopter pilots must have when it comes to manipulating the anti-torque pedals translates well to flying taildragger airplanes, which require a lot more work on landing and takeoff than airplanes with tricycle gear. Helicopter and airplane pilots have bickered since the dawn of helicopters about which they’d rather be in during an engine failure. For the sake of this article, we can leave multi-engine airplanes and helicopters out of the discussion and elaborate on a scenario in which the pilot must make a forced landing after an engine failure. An airplane can glide to potential landing sites. Cessna 172s have a glide ratio of 10:1, so they fly 10 feet for every foot they lose in altitude. Generally, they descend at around 500 feet per minute (FPM). If your engine fails at 5,000 feet and cannot be restarted, you have around 10 minutes to make an unscheduled sea-level landing. However, you must still find a field, road, or airport with sufficient stopping distance. I’ve heard it many times from professional fixed-wing pilots; if the engine fails in a helicopter they drop like a rock and you’ll probably die. It’s simply not true. Ardfern/Wikicommons Robinson helicopters have what’s called a sprag clutch and most other helicopters feature a freewheeling unit with a sprag clutch in it. The design purpose of these units is to allow torque to only be applied in one rotational direction on a drive shaft. The engine can apply torque but can’t remove it, much like a bicycle where you can pedal or rest but the bike keeps rolling. The main rotor of your helicopter keeps spinning in the correct direction, but in the event of an engine failure, the airflow through the main rotor reverses direction. This is called auto-rotation. When producing thrust the main rotor moves a column of air downward. When in auto-rotation, the helicopter is essentially gliding, using air moving up through the main rotor to maintain controlled flight and lift, albeit reduced lift. The Robinson R44 glide ratio is 4.7:1, less than half that of the Cessna 172, but landing options are far greater. Vacant lots, rooftops and other less than ideal landing zones have been successfully utilized by helicopter pilots unfortunate enough to have been faced with an engine failure. Early in primary training, helicopter pilots practice autorotations, managing main rotor RPM, forward glide speed (approximately 55 knots in the R44), and maneuvering to reach the best landing spot available for the circumstances. If you watch police and news helicopters, they commonly circle a scene to maximize their options and the likelihood of a safe autorotation when they could be hovering. As for whether I’d rather be in a helicopter or a fixed-wing aircraft experiencing an engine failure, it depends heavily on the circumstances. I can tell you, however, that I have a great amount of respect for and faith in the ability of a professional helicopter pilot to put an auto-rotating helicopter down almost anywhere, even between the lines of a single spot in a parking lot. A perfect outcome is completing an autorotation to the ground without a scratch on the helicopter, but a little luck is required. Most pilots would agree that a successful emergency landing is one where no one on board the helicopter or on the ground is injured. Preserving the helicopter to fly another day comes in second to saving lives. That being said, helicopters do generally operate at low altitude and you have less time between the initial engine failure and needing to land. In all cases, you can train day and night for engine failures, but they still catch you by surprise when you’re at work in an aircraft. You don’t get to pick your real-life engine failure scenario. It goes without saying that if you knew you were going to have an engine failure beforehand you should not have gone flying. In cruise flight, helicopters can be flown much like an airplane. A common practice is using the collective to set an appropriate amount of engine output for continuous cruise performance, then leaving it alone and using cyclic inputs similar to the way you’d use the stick in an airplane. Forward and aft cyclic movements make slight adjustments to pitch to maintain cruise altitude, and of course, left and right cyclic movements roll left and right to stay on course. An R44 over a dramatic coastline., Robinson Helicopter You don’t use rudder pedals to steer the direction of flight in an airborne airplane very often, and the same is true for helicopters. A short trim string, which is a literal and actual yarn string on the front and within view of a pilot, is a visual reference helicopter pilots use to keep the helicopter fuselage aligned with the relative wind. They call that flying in trim, and it’s accomplished with the anti-torque pedals. Near the ground, most flight schools teach their students to fly with the skids underneath the helicopter aligned with the direction of travel. Like flying in trim, this is done with the anti-torque pedals as well. This eliminates the possibility of a skid touching down with lateral helicopter movement, which can cause a rollover. I’ve always advocated for people getting into aviation recreationally. Private citizens should be able to enjoy general aviation without the same qualifications and mindset as career pilots. I believe it’s good for aviation and society to have pilots that go sightseeing on weekends, taking trips in small airplanes, and keeping general aviation thriving. Every newly certified pilot is an additional ambassador for aviation, and our ability to take to the sky is inarguably one of mankind’s greatest achievements. A Bell 430 flies over the European countryside. The 430 is part of the 222 series, made famous in the show Airwolf. It remains one of the most striking helicopters ever created. , Bell Helicopter I still feel the same way about airplanes, but after learning to fly helicopters, my opinions have changed. Helicopter flying should never be casual. Most helicopter general aviation flying is in Robinsons. The Robinson R44 has the highest fatal accident rate of any civil helicopter, with 42 fatal accidents from 2006-2016. It’s not because the R44 is poorly engineered, it’s because Robinson helicopters made helicopter flying cheaper and more accessible. I’ve met many interesting characters in aviation over the years. One casual R44 owner-pilot in particular never performed preflight inspections because he believed it was in God’s hands. He elaborated that if his faith was strong enough God wouldn’t let him have an accident. Even recreational helicopter pilots must approach each flight as if it were their job. If you’re not 100% focused on doing everything right and keeping your skill level high, you have no business flying a helicopter.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 24, 2021",New Pods Will Allow Reaper Drones To Hunt Submarines And Launch Small Weapons And Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics recently announced that it had successfully flight-tested a dispenser pod as part of a broader demonstration of anti-submarine warfare capabilities it is developing for its MQ-9B SeaGuardian drone . In this particular test, the pods were used to release sonobuoys , but the company has said that they will also be able to launch precision-guided munitions, as well as small unmanned aircraft, the latter of which could then potentially operate as an autonomous swarm. The anti-submarine warfare test took place last November , with an MQ-9A carrying one of the 10-tube dispenser pods and other anti-submarine warfare (ASW) related systems as a surrogate for an MQ-9B SeaGuardian. The demonstration, which was conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Navy, involved the drone flying over that service’s expansive test ranges off the coast of Southern California, while transmitting data to a ground operations center hundreds of miles away at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. An artist’s conception of a fully-configured MQ-9B SeaGuardian drone. The new dispenser pods are seen under the wings., General Atomics “This demonstration is a first for airborne ASW,” said GA-ASI President David R. Alexander. “The successful completion of this testing paves the way for future development of more Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities from our MQ-9s.” During the test, the MQ-9A deployed 10 sonobuoys, in total. These included one AN/SSQ-36B , two AN/SSQ-62F Directional Command Activated Sonobuoy Systems (DICASS), and seven AN/SSQ-53G Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording (DIFAR) buoys. The AN/SSQ-36B is a bathythermograph type that can detect underwater objects by changes in water temperature. The DICASS is equipped with an active sonar, while the DIFAR passively gathers acoustic data. You can read more about how sonobuoys are used to search for enemy submarines in this past War Zone piece . The drone relayed data from the array to personnel on the ground, who were then able to successfully spot and track a Navy Mk 39 Expendable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Target ( EMATT ). The EMATT is a small torpedo-shaped device that simulates the acoustic and other signatures of a full-sized submarine. A Navy sailor throws a Mk 39 Expendable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Target (EMATT) off the side of a ship during a training exercise., USN Sonobuoys remain a critical part of modern ASW operations, with Russia notably announcing last year that it would equip its submarines with new expendable electronic warfare jammers as a countermeasure. The U.S. Navy, in particular, has been sounding the alarm in recent years about the growing threat posed by Russian , as well as Chinese , submarine fleets. Both countries are steadily increasing the size of their submarine forces, including the addition of more modern designs with various features that make them harder to detect and track underwater. The clear benefits of MQ-9s, or any other type of drone for that matter, equipped to deploy sonobuoys is that this could help ease the burden on manned maritime patrol aircraft, as well as their crews, and provide a lower-cost capacity to rapidly deploy arrays of buoys over a broad area. The cost-per-flight-hour to operate an MQ-9-sized drone is significantly lower than that of the Navy’s P-8A Poseidon , for example, as a direct product of the drones requiring fewer resources to operate and maintain. In the future, a single P-8A working together with unmanned aircraft loaded with sonobuoys could cast a far wider net for enemy submarines in a shorter period of time without a dramatic need for additional manpower and other resources, something that could be particularly valuable in an expeditionary context . This would also turn the Poseidon and its crew effectively into the ASW battle manager on scene. The drones, acting anti-submarine “loyal wingmen” of sorts, could be redirected as necessary. A US Navy P-8A Poseidon drops a torpedo., USN Since sonobuoys have limited battery life, during sustained operations, arrays need to re-seeded from time to time, too. Drones would be able to perform this re-seeding as required, as well, freeing up the manned aircraft to focus more on classifying, tracking, and potentially engaging contacts of interest. Unmanned aircraft tending to sonobuoy arrays could also potentially do some pre-processing of the data before passing it along to other platforms, such as maritime patrol planes or ships hunting down below . Developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning could help automate the process of detecting and classifying potential threats, helping to weed out false positives or other unwanted information, to reduce the workload on actual human personnel. The November 2020 test also underscored that other MQ-9 variants beyond the SeaGuardian, and potentially other types of unmanned aircraft, could carry these dispenser pods and operate in the ASW role. This could be of particular interest to the Marine Corps, which has been working to acquire a small fleet of Reapers and other larger drones in the past few years, and is also now looking at how it might be able to contribute to submarine hunting missions in the future. You can read more about those proposed concepts of operation in this past War Zone piece . In recent months, the U.S. government has also approved a number of export sales of MQ-9Bs to be equipped with ASW packages or that could be fitted with them, including to the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan . While all of these ASW-related developments are significant, General Atomics has also outlined broader plans for the dispenser pods in the past. Last year, it released an infographic on various existing or in development payloads for the MQ-9 series, including the dispensers, which a Reaper can carry up to four of at once. It mentioned the plans for the November sonobuoy test, but also said that it could be configured to release precision-guided munitions or small drones. An infographic General Atomics released last year showing various payloads available for the MQ-9-series or in development for those drones, including the dispenser pods., General Atomics While the exact types of munitions General Atomics might be considering integrating into the pod are unclear, the infographic showed a Dynetics GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM) and said that dispenser was compatible with the Common Launch Tube (CLT). Various elements of the U.S. military, including Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the U.S. Marine Corps, have been employing launchers using CLTs on multiple types of manned and unmanned aircraft. These include certain AC-130 gunship variants and KC-130 tanker-transports with the Harvest Hawk kit , as well as MQ-9s, for years now. The CLTs themselves can fire various small glide bombs, such as the GBU-44/B Viper Strike and GBU-69/B, as well as diminutive missiles, such as the AGM-176 Griffin . Interestingly, back in 2018, Northrop Grumman also showed off models of dispensers for the MQ-9, as well as the U.S. Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which were capable of carrying dozens of small precision-guided munitions at once. At the time, we at The War Zone highlighted how such a dispenser could significantly increase the magazine depth of an individual drone, allowing it to either engage more targets in a short period of time or provide more persistent firepower during longer-duration armed overwatch or similar missions over a particular part of the battlefield. A model depicting a dispenser pod for the MQ-9 capable of carrying 54 small precision-guided munitions that Northrop Grumman publicly showed back in 2018. A standard 500-pound-class Paveway laser-guided bomb is shown for comparison., Joseph Trevithick Launchers using CLTs have been used to deploy small drones from aircraft, as well. These include aerial launches of Raytheon’s Coyote , which is also shown on the General Atomics infographic, as well as the Area-I Air-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System 600 ( ALTIUS 600 ). The Army is notably working on acquiring a family of so-called Air Launch Effects (ALE), which it hopes will eventually include small air-launched drones equipped with various sensors and electronic warfare packages. Some ALEs could also be loitering munitions, also known as “ suicide drones ,” capable of carrying out kinetic attacks directly. There are also plans for the various ALE types to be able to operate together as fully-autonomous swarms, which inherently have the capability to confuse and overwhelm enemy defenses, including in maritime enviornments. You can read more about this effort in this past War Zone piece . A US Army UH-60 helicopter fires an ALTIUS 600 drone from a CLT during a test., US Army If it could be adapted to the MQ-1C, one of the platforms the Army wants to integrate the ALEs onto, General Atomics’ dispenser pod would certainly seem to be a good fit for the effort. Last year, General Atomics demonstrated the ability of the Gray Eagle to launch an ALTIUS 600 from a CLT under its wing. Using the pods to launch drone swarms from larger unmanned aircraft flying further away from enemy air defenses could help breathe additional life into the MQ-9, which the Air Force views as increasingly vulnerable, especially in higher-end conflicts. The service, which is now looking for a Reaper replacement, presently dubbed MQ-Next , had sought to stop buying MQ-9s entirely , but Congress has blocked those plans , at least for the time being. This would actually, in many ways, reflect the Army’s plans regarding ALE-armed MQ-1Cs, which present the same survivability concerns. A contracting notice the service released last year offered some insight into their planned concepts of operation. “Army Futures Command (AFC) has identified a future fight in an Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS)-rich environment where platforms must be survivable, attritable, or expendable to deliver sensing capabilities effectively where 1) The MQ-1C Gray Eagle flies racetrack patterns tangential to the IADS threat, at 80 km [~50 miles] distance, 2a) ALEs deploy from the MQ-1C Gray Eagle as the forward most element of the advanced team in areas of expected enemy contact in order to detect, identity, location and report (DILR) and attack/disrupt/decoy threat assets to initiate disintegration of the IADS,” the notice read. A reference is made here to “attritable” platforms, which means designs that are low-cost enough for commanders to employ them in riskier situations that would preclude the use of a more expensive, exquisite assets. An Army MQ-1C with a pair of CLTs under its wing being prepared for a test in 2020., US Army The U.S. military, as a whole, is increasingly interested in swarming technology and has publicly demonstrated numerous developments in that regard in the past few years. These efforts have included additional experiments involving other air-launched drones, including multiple tests of the Perdix miniature unmanned aircraft deployed from flare launchers on U.S. Air Force F-16 Vipers and from underwing dispenser pods on U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornets between 2014 and 2016. General Atomics has, of course, also been working on its own larger air-launched and air-recoverable drone, Sparrowhawk, with pictures showing a prototype underneath the wing of a Reaper. You can read more about that project in this past War Zone piece . All told, these new dispensers for the MQ-9 look set to help enable the drone to take on all-new submarine-hunting missions. At the same time, the pods open the doors to significantly expanding the firepower of the Reaper, as well as potentially other drones, and help transform it into a platform able to send drone swarms heading into enemy territory.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 19, 2020",Space Force Has A Unit Dedicated To Orbital Warfare That Now Operates The X-37B Spaceplane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The fledgling U.S. Space Force’s Space Delta 9 is tasked with performing a mission set that the service describes as orbital warfare. This includes keeping an eye out for potentially hostile activity in space, as well as deterring those threats and even potentially defeating them, according to the unit’s official website. Publicly, it provides this support primarily through various space-based surveillance and communications systems, but, interestingly, it is also responsible for overseeing the operations of the experimental X-37B mini space shuttle , the exact mission and capabilities of which remain obscure . Space Force highlighted the intriguing orbital warfare mission of Space Delta 9 , as part of the larger array of capabilities within its new Space Operations Command (SpOC), in a Tweet earlier this week. The unit had first come into existence in July and had previously been known as the Air Force’s 750th Operations Group, which had only been activated and assigned to that service’s 50th Space Wing the month before. 50th Space Wing, headquartered at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado, was also transferred to the newest branch of America’s armed forces that month, at which time it was rebranded as the Peterson-Schriever Garrison . Space Delta 9 “conducts protect and defend operations from space and provides response options to deter and defeat adversary threats in space,” according to an infographic that accompanied the Space Force Tweet on Oct. 24. “The mission of Delta 9 is to prepare, present, and project assigned and attached forces for the purpose of conducting protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats,” is how the unit’s official website describes it. It also shows the unit’s insignia, which is distinct from those of the other deltas, and simply features the roman numeral “IX” for nine in silver along with a single red star at the top, all on a black background. USSF At present, there are four subordinate units assigned to Space Delta 9: the 1st and 3rd Space Operations Squadrons, the 750th Operations Support Squadron, and Space Delta 9, Detachment 1. Publicly, the 1st Space Operations Squadron operates a constellation of space-based surveillance satellites, including the Space Based Space Surveillance System (SBSS), Advanced Technology Risk Reduction (ATRR) system, Operationally Responsive Space-5 (ORS-5), and the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP). SBSS, launched in 2010, was the U.S. military’s first space-based sensor specifically designed for “Space Domain Awareness,” or SDA, and is capable of “metric observations and Space Object Identification data on satellites operating in low-earth, semi-synchronous and geosynchronous orbits,” according to the squadron’s official website . The year before, the Air Force had worked with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to launch the ATRR satellite, which is also now used for SDA, but originally “served as a pathfinder for next-generation sensor technology for future MDA space missions.” The GSSAP satellites, the first two of which reached orbit in 2014, “provide a space-based capability operating in the near-geosynchronous orbit regime supporting U.S. Space Command space surveillance operations as a dedicated SSN [Space Surveillance Network] sensor.” The SSN includes space and ground-based systems to monitor activity in the upper reaches of the Earth’s atmosphere and beyond. An artist’s rendering of two GSSAP satellites., USAF The ORS-5 satellite, also known as SensorSat, which was launched in 2017 and reached full operational capability last year, “operates at an altitude of 372 miles and continuously scans the geosynchronous orbit at a reduced cost compared to larger, more complex satellites.” An Air Force news story from last year said that “it detects, tracks and catalogs man-made objects orbiting Earth such as active and inactive satellites, spent rocket parts and fragmentation debris, informing military, civil and commercial space operators if tracked objects may interfere with the satellites on orbit” and can also predict “when and where decaying space objects are located and where they may re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere.” Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory perform a test on the ORS-5 satellite., Lincoln Laboratory The 3rd Space Operations Squadron operates the Defense Satellite Communications System III (DSCS III) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) communications satellite constellations. These “provide secure high-rate data communications links to the President, Secretary of Defense, theater commanders and strategic and tactical forces worldwide,” according to that unit’s website . The 750th Operational Support Squadron provides training and readiness support across Space Delta 9. It also provides intelligence support, as well as helping to refine existing tactics, techniques, and procedures and develop new ones. Lastly, and certainly most interestingly, is Space Delta 9’s Detachment 1 . While the exact ownership of the X-37B has been at the center of some jockeying between the Air Force and Space Force, this is the unit that oversees its operations once it gets into orbit. This secretive spaceplane has been the topic of much discussion and speculation as to its role since it first began making trips into space in 2010. This has including talk of whether it might carry, or at least be used to test, space-based weapons, including directed energy systems, such as laser or high-power microwaves . The X-37B experimental spaceplane., USAF The address of the Detachment’s official website also indicates that it is in some way related to the Air Force’s previous 3rd Space Experimentation Squadron and the unit’s official history includes achievements from before Space Force was established. This includes operating the Automated Navigation and Guidance Experiment for Local Space (ANGELS) spacecraft until it was decommissioned in 2017 . Detachment 1 was said to be set to take over the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter Augmented Geosynchronous Laboratory Experiment, or EAGLE , from the Air Force Research Laboratory this year. ANGELS was an “experimental spacecraft [that] utilized autonomous navigation to advance the tactics, techniques and procedures necessary to safely conduct rendezvous and proximity operations,” according to the Detachment’s website. EAGLE is a ring-shaped payload adapter that can maneuver by itself once reaching orbit and is capable of hosting six fixed or deployable payloads. Launched in 2018, one of EAGLE’s payloads was the Mycroft spacecraft , which had a mission to “advance Space Domain Awareness technology and enhance space object characterization capabilities while performing rendezvous and proximity operations.” An artist’s conception of EAGLE., Orbital ATK Small satellites that can rendezvous with and maneuver very close to other satellites could be used to perform on-orbit inspections and potentially repairs , among other innocuous tasks. However, they have inherent intelligence-gathering and anti-satellite capabilities, as a result, as well. A small satellite that could get in close proximity to another one could be able to collect imagery or gather electronic signals data on that target, as well as potentially blind, jam, disable or destroy it using non-kinetic or kinetic attacks, including just smashing into it. This concept is sometimes referred to as a “ killer satellite ” and is a capability the U.S. government has said that Russia, as well as China, are actively developing. A Defense Intelligence Agency infographic showing the many ways one satellite might attack another., DIA It’s important to note that Space Delta 9’s mission set also includes conducting “on-orbit experimentation and technology demonstrations for the U.S. Space Force,” according to its official website. Still, it’s notable that those tasks, broadly, and the X-37B, specifically, as well as EAGLE, are housed within a unit focused on orbital warfare that has a stated, if not defined capability to not only watch for, but actively defeat threats in space. The Air Force, and now the Space Force, has been very tight-lipped over the years about what it describes as “counterspace” capabilities. At present, only three such systems – the Counter Communications System (CCS), Meadowlands, and Bounty Hunter – have been publicly acknowledged and very few details about them exist. CCS, the latest version of which Space Force reached initial operational capability with earlier this year, is understood to be a ground-based communications jamming system. Meadowlands is a successor to CCS that is now in development. Bounty Hunter , which also appears to be ground-based, has been described as an “electronic warfare system,” but its exact function and capabilities are classified. A picture Space Force released accompanying the news that it had achieved initial operational capability with the Counter Communications System Block 10.2, but it’s unclear if these trailer-mounted antennas are actually part of that system., USSF We also know that Space Force is working together with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. government’s top satellite intelligence arm, to develop a new space-based sensor, called Silent Barker . Details about this satellite, which is scheduled to head into space in 2022, are also limited. It will reportedly combine intelligence-gathering and surveillance capabilities with an eye toward threats and other objects of interest in space as part of the “protect and defend” mission that Space Force says is at the core of its orbital warfare concepts of operation. It remains unknown whether or not the X-37B has been employed to evaluate any counterspace systems, but its highly adaptable truckbed-like payload bay could be very useful for accommodating experimental concepts in this regard. It is also known to be extremely maneuverable , which would be in line with Detachment 1’s other work on EAGLE and its predecessor organization’s involvement with ANGELS. We also don’t know whether the U.S. military has any other on-orbit anti-satellite capabilities, though there has been active public discussion of developing such systems in recent years. At the same time, the Air Force, as well as now the Space Force, have alluded to the existence of additional counterspace capabilities on multiple occasions in recent years. In 2015, U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, then-head of Air Force Space Command, said that his service had more ways to fight in space beyond just maneuvering friendly satellites out of harm’s way and jamming hostile ones in an interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes,” but said he couldn’t elaborate. Hyten is now the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Just last year, then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson said that “there may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence.” Opponents “need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty,” she continued. There have also been a number of calls to declassify more about U.S. military’s space-based systems and what they can do, regardless of whether they are weapons or not. Whatever the counterspace capabilities available to Space Delta 9 might be, and how the X-37B might fit into that ecosystem, the threats to American space-based assets are very real now and are only continuing to grow, as The War Zone has highlighted on numerous occasions . In addition to the aforementioned killer satellites, Russia and China are developing a host of other anti-satellite technologies including ground-based and air-launched interceptors and directed energy weapons . In July, Time published an interview with Chief of Space Operations General John “Jay” Raymond, Space Force’s top uniformed officer, in which he publicly asserted for the first time that Russia had tested an on-orbit anti-satellite interceptor, as well. Other countries have also demonstrated anti-satellite or other counterspace capabilities or say they are in the process of developing them for both offensive and defensive purposes. In addition, where the thresholds might be for a war in space, or fight in space as part of a primarily tertiary conflict, to erupt, and how to prosecute such a conflict , remain largely undefined, but Space Force is actively trying to figure out those concepts of operation now. No matter what, Space Delta 9, and the X-37B, look set to be central components for this rapidly evolving notion of orbital warfare.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",The Air Force’s New Report On Ballistic And Cruise Missiles Misses Its Target,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The military intelligence analysts at the U.S. Air Force have released their latest public report on ballistic and cruise missile threats facing the U.S. military, with a heavy focus on China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. However, some of the information the report includes is badly out of date and a number of significant developments appear to be omitted entirely. The Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) posted the 2020 Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threat report online earlier this month. The last edition of this public report was released in 2017. An Indian Agni-II medium-range ballistic missile. The latest NASIC report features reduced coverage of both Indian and Pakistani weapons., AP PHOTO/GURINDER OSAN “With their relatively low operating costs, potential to penetrate defense systems, and value as a symbol of national power, ballistic and cruise missiles will continue to be the offensive weapons of choice for many nations,” the report says by way of introduction. “As such, they are threats that must be carefully considered in future military planning and operations.” This is certainly true and the report provides a wealth of information on the topic. However, independent experts and organizations were also quick to find curious errors, inconsistencies, and omissions throughout. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a U.S.-based global policy think tank, conducted a particularly thorough analysis of the report, which is worth reading in full . The primary focus of the report, as already noted, to begin with, is on developments in China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. China China has significantly expanded its ballistic and cruise missile arsenal, including both nuclear and conventional types, in recent years. The addition of the DF-41 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), DF-17 tipped with a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle, both of which you can read about here , and the growing importance of the DF-26 family are particularly notable examples of this. FAS identifies the description of the new Chinese JL-3 sea-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) as a particular point of interest in the report since it is revealed that this weapon is capable of carrying multiple warheads. This appears to be the first public confirmation of this capability for the JL-3 from the U.S. Intelligence Community, which has been reported in the past. Development of the JL-3 began with the primary intention of it becoming the primary armament of the Type 096 nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, or SSBN. The weapon will be able to deliver multiple warheads over a distance of more than 6,200 miles, according to NASIC. The report further suggests that the fielding of the JL-3 will be a key element in the development of the country’s strategic arsenal, which is predicted to double over the next 10 years. FAS notes that the expected range of the new JL-3 means that a Chinese SSBN homeported in the South China Sea would still need to leave its base to be able to hit targets in the continental United States, potentially having to venture far out into the Pacific. At the same time, the report curiously does not mention the two additional submarines that are being added to the Chinese SSBN fleet now. Last year, the Pentagon’s report on China’s ballistic missile arsenal noted that the People’s Liberation Army Navy had six Type 094 Jin class ballistic missile submarines , “four operational and two outfitting at Huludao Shipyard.” The Type 094 submarines are armed with the previous JL-2 SLBM, but reports have suggested that they could also carry JL-3s. JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles on trucks during a parade in 2019., China Military NASIC also considers the DF-41 ICBM to now be operationally deployed, a significant change from its 2017 report, as evidenced by the change in Western designation from the “experimental” CSS-X-20 to the in-service CSS-20. The new report suggests that at least 16 launchers have been deployed. The DF-41 is a road-mobile ICBM, first publicly displayed in October 2019. With an estimated range of around 9,300 miles, it is China’s longest-range strategic nuclear weapon and its service entry is clearly a significant development, although the first of these missiles were reportedly deployed operationally in 2017, with two brigades of them in service by the end of that year. The road-mobile DF-41 ICBM., KYODO VIA AP IMAGES NASIC’s report says that China also has “16+” road-mobile launchers for DF-31A and DF-31AG ICBMs, though FAS believes, based on its own open-source work, that the actual number is “probably twice that.” The NASIC report is also unclear on the warhead for the DF-31AG version, specifying one for the DF-31A variant, but “unknown” for the DF-31AG. “The NASIC report projection for the increase in Chinese nuclear ICBM warheads that can reach the United States is inconsistent and self-contradicting,” the FAS analysis contends. While at one point in the report NASIC claims that this number will grow to “well over 200” within the next five years, later on, it provides the figure of “well over 100” in the same period, the same as was projected in the 2017 report. As FAS notes, the authors of the report “might simply have forgotten to update the text.” NASIC notably continues to attribute a range of 1,860+ miles to the DF-26 rather than the 2,480+ miles found in the last annual Pentagon report on China , as well. We also now know the Western designations for various Chinese missiles that have appeared in the past few years. The DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) is now also known as the CSS-18, and the DF-17, which uses a ballistic missile to boost an unpowered DF-ZF hypersonic boost-glide vehicle , is called the CSS-22. DF-26s on parade., IMAGINECHINA VIA AP An entirely new addition to the 2021 report is the air-launched ballistic missile category, but this surprisingly excludes China, further suggesting that some sections of the report make use of data from no later than early 2018. The importance of this new class of ballistic missiles and their potential to engage large, relatively slow-moving ships, such as aircraft carriers, is something that The War Zone has charted in the past and you can read more about them here and here . A purported image of the H-6N bomber, designed to carry the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile. This category of weapon is absent from the report’s coverage of China., Chinese Internet Iran This country has long been engaged in controversial missile development programs and has recently revealed a number of novel developments, which have been covered in depth by The War Zone , including so-called “missile farms” and an underground missile magazine . NASIC says that Tehran has a desire to have a “strategic counter” to the United States that could involve it developing an ICBM, perhaps using technology developed for its space program . The most recent Iranian ballistic launch mentioned in the report is the Khorramshahr-2 MRBM, in 2019. This weapon uses “fins installed on the warhead to enable guidance throughout flight.” Other than that, and the fact that this is a liquid-fuel, road-mobile system, there are no other details provided about the Khorramshahr-2, other than it having the same range — 1,240+ miles — as the original Khorramshahr. The Iranian Khorramshahr MRBM was unveiled during a military parade in September 2017. , AP PHOTO/EBRAHIM NOROOZI NASIC also confirms that Iran is developing a ground-launched land-attack cruise missile (LACM), describing the latest Hoveyzeh LACM that was unveiled in February 2019 as a follow-on to the Soumar. Both the Soumar and Hoveyzeh are thought to be based on the Soviet-designed Kh-55 air-launched cruise missile, according to NASIC. https://youtube.com/watch?v=jJIXPdi-ZLQ North Korea North Korea has been at the center of controversy on account of its nuclear developments and long-range missile programs for much of the period since the 2017 report was published. In that time there have been two high-profile military parades that have provided observers with a chance to see its expanding strategic missile capabilities up close. The North Korean section features significant updates compared to the 2017 report, reflecting the major strategic weapons developments that the country has made in the last four years. A new ICBM has been added, the Hwasong-15 , which is thought to have a range of 7,450+ miles. However, there is no mention of the even larger Hwasong-16 that first appeared last September and which you can read more about here . Missing from the report: the latest North Korean ICBM, the Hwasong-16., NK KOREAN STATE NEWS Of the various systems that have been tested since 2017, some are also provided with revised performance estimates, including 2,790+ miles for the Hwasong-12 IRBM. On the other hand, the rage estimate for the Taepo Dong 2 ICBM has now been removed, although it is unclear why. Two other ICBMs, the Hwasong-13 and Hwasong-14 , both now feature increased range estimates, of 7,450+ miles and 6,200+ miles, respectively. Another problem in the coverage of North Korea ICBMs has been identified by Ankit Panda , an international security expert who focuses on strategic weaponry. On his Twitter feed, he observed that the document describes the “Hwasong-14” taking part in an October 2015 parade, while the correct name for this weapon is the Hwasong-13. Compounding the issue, the real Hwasong-14 is furthermore described as a “modified Hwasong-14.” The result is a misleading account of North Korea’s ICBM development. In the following Twitter thread, Panda explains how we know in the first place that the nomenclature has become muddled in the NASCI report, and why this matters. None of the ICBMs are listed as deployed in the NASIC analysis. While it is no surprise that the latest Pukguksong-5 SLBM is not included in the report, since it was only revealed earlier this month, also absent is the Pukguksong-4, which first appeared in the previous military parade in October 2020. That leaves only the Puguksong-1 and Pukguksong-3 SLBMs, neither of which are listed as deployed. Russia Since the previous report appeared, Russia has been engaged in the development of different high-profile “super weapons” that were unveiled by President Vladimir Putin in a state-of-nation address in early 2018. Aside from those ambitious projects, however, Moscow has continued to modernize the existing elements within its strategic nuclear triad, at the same time also fielding new and treaty-busting missiles cruise missiles , for example. In terms of the total number of warheads given for Russian ICBMs and SLBMs, the NASIC figure of around 1,400 warheads is very close to the 1,420 identified by FAS, and the 1,447 provided as part of the New START data. It is worth noting that this is the figure for total available warheads, not a reflection of the number of missiles actually fielded that could carry them. Overall, the figure has dropped from the “over 1,500” reported in 2017 and NASIC predicts that total to continue to decline as a result of treaty limits, the retirement of older weapons, and limited budgets. The primary anomaly identified by FAS in talking about Russia is the data provided for the RS-26 Rubezh, also known by the Western designation SS-X-28. The RS-26 is known to be a shorter-range ICBM, or perhaps an IRBM. Although the latest information provided by NASIC is for 2018, it is claimed that the weapon is still under development. Many other sources, however, including The War Zone , contends that Moscow likely abandoned work on the RS-26 amid a budget shortfall, which would be in line with the lack of any official updates about this weapon’s development after 2018. Russia’s most advanced operational ICBM, the RS-24 Yars, is loaded into its silo ., FACEBOOK VIDEO SCREENCAP FAS does identify what also seems to be a discrepancy in the ICBM and SLBM warhead data, however, highlighting the statement “Russia retains over 1,000 nuclear warheads on ICBMs.” If this is the case, FAS contends, then the Russian Navy’s SLBM warhead inventory must also be smaller than is generally understood. Among the cruise missiles, the nuclear-tipped, air-launched Kh-102 is a new addition to the 2021 report. This suggests the weapon is now in frontline service with the Russian Aerospace Forces, an idea backed up by the assignment of an appropriate Western designation, AS-23B, although this is missing from the report. Another possible error, or misunderstanding, relates to the 3M14 Kalibr LACM , known in the West as the SS-N-30. The NASIC report identifies this as a “nuclear possible” weapon, indicating that it can be fitted with either a conventional or nuclear warhead. As FAS points out, the Russian government has previously confirmed that the missile can be fitted with a nuclear warhead. A Kalibr LACM launched from a Russian Navy Burya-M class corvette., DENIS ABRAMOV/SPUTNIK VIA AP What’s missing? “Overall […] the new report may be equally interesting because of what it does not include,” Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, wrote. “There are a number of cases where the report is scaled back compared with previous versions,” he continued “And throughout the report, much of the data clearly hasn’t been updated since 2018. In some places, it is even inconsistent and self-contradicting.” For example, the cruise missile section of the report is much thinner than in the past, with only China, Iran, and Russia being listed. In the past, the coverage of nations operating or developing strategic-capable cruise missiles was much more comprehensive. While the omission of certain close U.S. allies in this category might be more understandable, it is odd that neither India nor Pakistan warrants a mention for their cruise missiles. One such weapon, Pakistan’s Babur ground-launched cruise missile , can be seen under test in the video below: On the other hand, the ballistic missile section includes all relevant countries. However, there are limitations here, too, among them an incomplete table of ballistic missile launches, with the most recent such data inexplicably missing. Moreover, all these kinds of threats are proliferating and also in countries outside those with nuclear stockpiles, even including non-state actors. For example, Houthi rebels in Yemen have employed both ballistic missiles and cruise missiles against Saudi Arabian targets in recent years, reflecting an ever-increasing ability to hit targets at longer ranges. While the Houthis have almost certainly received assistance from Iran in conducting these strikes, the significance of such advanced weapons in non-state hands should not be underestimated. Exactly why the NASIC report contains so much contradictory information and has so many significant gaps, is hard to say. For their part, FAS suggests that possible reasons could be “changes in classification rules, chaos in the Intelligence Community under the Trump administration, or simply oversight.” However, the fact that so many of the updates seem to end in 2018 might suggest that only limited efforts were made to acquire new information after this date or if it was available, it was decided not to incorporate it. We can only hope that the next report, in four year’s time, provides a more thorough analysis of all the world ballistic and cruise missile inventories. Until then, it will be down to FAS, and other independent experts, to fill in the many gaps.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 60 years of service, the VH-3 , which is based on the venerable Sea King helicopter, has flown its last President into retirement. The bittersweet realization is also a monumental tribute to the Sea King’s fantastic service record providing support for what is essentially a no failure mission. Starting this summer, the Sikorsky VH-92A will begin replacing the VH-3Ds, as well as the Black Hawk-based VH-60Ns , a process that is slated to be completed by 2023, marking the end of both types’ service in the coveted ‘White Top’ Marine One role. VH-92 seen during landing test trials on the White House lawn. , U.S. MARINE CORPS PHOTO BY SGT. HUNTER HELIS Trump boarded the iconic green and white helicopter for the last time from the White House’s South Lawn this morning at around 8:30 AM. It flew off past the Washington Monument and into the morning sky before doing a tour around Capitol Hill. It then headed off to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where Trump would take Air Force One to his Florida residence. After 11 Presidents, Trump should be the last the VH-3 will fly away into retirement. The VH-3s, which started flying in the presidential airlift role shortly after their front-line counterparts were introduced into Navy service during the Kennedy Administration, have been an iconic fixture of presidential life ever since. JFK walking off a then-new VH-3A Marine One helicopter. The Army also flew the type for a period of time in the same role. , NASMI They have also made history in their own right. One of the most memorable presidential moments of all time included a VH-3A as a set-piece. That, of course, was when Richard Nixon left the White House after resigning in 1974, giving the famous two-handed v-for-victory sign at the top of Marine One’s steps. Nixon leaves the White House after resigning., AP In more recent times, newer VH-3Ds have traveled all over the world and around the country—anywhere POTUS goes, a pair of Marine One aircraft goes too , whether you see them or not. And while they have been consistently upgraded over the years, especially in terms of defensive systems and interior accommodations (you can check out the latest VH-3D interior here and take a historic look at Marine One interiors in this past piece of mine ), the VH-3Ds flying today remain remarkably similar to when they were first introduced in the mid-1970s. A pair of VH-3Ds fly President Obama. During operational missions, the VH-3Ds fly in pairs, with one being a decoy to confuse potential adversaries. , AP Maybe the most incredible aspect of the VH-3D’s career is that it has actually made so little bad news. While they are needy, aging airframes, they have proven to be reliable steeds for such a demanding mission. Of course, it is also worth remembering that they get more maintenance attention than any other helicopters on earth. Readiness is key though, as these helicopters also play a critical continuity of government role . Still, the need to replace these decades-old helicopters has been clear for many years. Just for reference, the Pentagon retired all other Sea King helicopters a decade and a half ago, and even then, they were being used only in a very limited manner. A VH-3D approaches the White House land during the Reagan Administration in 1987., US National Archives An abortive and hugely expensive attempt to replace the VH-3D with the VH-71 Kestral, a variant of the triple-engined EH-101, started under the George W. Bush Administration and was canceled after Obama took office. In an attempt not to repeat the failings of that program, the VH-92 program was initiated in 2014 with 21 full-up VIP aircraft and two utility examples for testing and training making up the planned fleet. Two VH-92s in formation over the capital. , BLEND QATIPI Currently, there are 11 VH-3Ds and eight VH-60Ns that make up the “White Top” presidential airlift fleet, all of which will be replaced by the VH-92s. This new aircraft is based on the Sikorsky H-92 Helibus and has had a relatively smooth and on-budget development. This all will hopefully pay off this summer when they start actually flying POTUS. Schedule for HMX-1’s inventory. There is over a year and a half room in the schedule to still have the VH-92 fleet fully in place by the next administration., USMC Overall, the VH-92s are far more modern, larger, and more capable than their predecessors in pretty much every way. Still, they have big shoes to fill as the VH-3D has provided an incredible return on investment and has safely moved the president from point A to B for whopping 60 years. A marvelous accomplishment to ponder, really. It’s also worth noting that the same could be said about the two 30-year-old 747-200-based VC-25As that serve as Air Force One. These aircraft will be replaced by VC-25Bs , based on the 747-8i, in less than four years’ time. The aircraft are going through conversion now near San Antonio, with both of the jets planned to have replaced their predecessors by the end of 2024 .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An absolutely massive motorcade took President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, along with former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, among others, around the greater Washington, D.C. area after the inauguration today. At one point, at least seven heavily armored and otherwise custom-built presidential limousines, commonly known as “Beasts,” together with an armada of other armored SUV limousines and supporting vehicles, took part in the procession. You can read more about the vehicles that typically make up presidential motorcades in this past War Zone feature . Traditionally, the inauguration is followed by a very public parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, the center of the city has been turned into a veritable fortress , with 25,000 members of the National Guard and thousands more U.S. military personnel and law enforcement officers now providing an unprecedented level of security, following the storming of the Capitol building by supporters of now former President Donald Trump on Jan. 6. That’s to say nothing of the additional safety protocols that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic already imposed on the ceremonies. Multiple Beasts are seen in the presidential motorcade heading to Arlington National Cemetery after the inauguration on Jan. 20, 2021., CBS News capture So, instead, the motorcade also took Biden and Harris, together with their spouses, went to Arlington to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Obama, Bush, and Clinton, and their spouses, along with other officials and members of the media, accompanied them. Trump did not attend the inauguration, at all, instead flying to Florida earlier in the day. Jimmy Carter, the only other surviving President of the United States, was also not present due to health concerns. Former Vice President Pence, who did attend the inauguration, did not go to Arlington. Footage of all seven Beasts together begins at around 8:24:00 in the runtime of the video below if it does not automatically start from that point. There is other footage of various configurations of the motorcade from before and after the inauguration throughout. Afterward, the motorcade returned to downtown D.C. to take part in a more muted procession toward the White House. The bulk of the traditional parade was transformed into a virtual “ Parade Across America .” The sheer size of the assembled fleet of vehicles outside of the Capitol after the inauguration got underway was a sight to behold in of itself. It seems very likely that multiple federal agencies beyond the U.S. Secret Service, pooled their resources to help fill out this motorcade and the transportation needs of other VIPs. A screengrab from live footage of the inauguration showing just some of the assembled vehicles outside of the Capitol., CNBC capture SUVs waiting to pick up former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, and their spouses, among others, after the inauguration., CNBC capture A view looking away from the Capitol as President Biden and Vice President Harris conducted a ceremonial inspection of troops after the inauguration. More vehicles are visible in the background., CNBC capture Of course, having Biden, Harris, and three other living Presidents all in the same place would clearly make this motorcade an unusually large target, even without the added security and public safety issues at play right now in the nation’s capital. It’s not surprising that nothing spared to provide top-level security for the entire procession. Still, seeing at least seven Beasts driving together at once, along with a huge number of other armored SUV limos, is unprecedented and we here at The War Zone can’t remember the last time we saw anywhere near that many in the same place at the same time. The entire Presidential limo fleet, which the Secret Service maintains, is understood to only consist of between 16 and 20 vehicles in total, made up of two generations of cars. Two are typically employed, with one actually carrying the President and the other acting as a decoy car and spare in case the primary vehicle is disabled for any reason. It’s not exactly clear who might have been riding in the other Beasts, but President Biden and Vice President Harris, along with their spouses, did travel separately and there could have been a requirement for additional spares, as a result, that would have accounted for a significant number of the limos. Live coverage of the event showed that former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, along with their spouses, traveled in armored SUVs. At least three of the examples in Biden’s motorcade were of the newest type , the first images of which emerged in 2017 and that which made its public debut the following year. This included the one carrying Biden, the 46th President of the United States, which had a special Washington, D.C. 59th Presidential Inauguration license plate with just “46” on it. The plate also had the phrase “Taxation Without Representation,” a play on the common refrain of “ no taxation without representation ” by American colonists during the lead up to the American Revolution. The District of Columbia has adopted this slogan as a reflection of its lack of voting representation in Congress and it is often referenced by advocates pushing for the federal city to become an actual state. The latest iteration of the presidential limo, also known as the Next Generation Parade Limousine , was designed by General Motors and has an outward appearance similar to recent models of the Cadillac CT6 sedan. The remaining Beasts in the procession were examples of the previous generation, which entered service 2009, and that has an exterior aesthetic similar to that of a Cadillac STS. The video below shows the public debut of the next-generation Beast as part of a motorcade carrying then-President Donald Trump in New York City in 2018. While its exact specifications of these limos are understandably classified, the actual underlying chassis and body are actually derived from larger truck designs. All of the Beasts are heavily armored and designed to be at least resistant to significantly powerful weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades and mines. They also have fire suppression systems, run-flat tires and can be hermetically sealed to protect against nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) threats. Night vision driving systems, secure communications gear, and various defensive measures are also integrated into the vehicles, which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The video below shows examples of the previous generation of Beasts during rehearsals for President Trump’s inauguration in 2017. As mentioned, a massive amount of armored and non-armored Chevy Suburban SUVs were also part of the motorcade. The U.S. Secret Service operates examples of these vehicles configured as limos , as well as various other types setup as mobile command and control centers , electronic countermeasures platforms, and simply for carrying the members of the escorting protective details . The new six-door Ford F350 Super Duty-based Mobile Communications Vehicle (MCV), which is packed with high-bandwidth satellite communications and data-sharing links, among other equipment, was also on hand today. You can read more about this vehicle, which first appeared publicly in 2018, in this past War Zone piece . At least one of the Suburbans had interesting protective covers its rear wheels. Combined with the presence of running boards on this particular SUV, this feature may be intended to prevent Secret Service or other personnel hanging on the outside from getting injured by the rear wheels while in motion. Photographs and video of the motorcade also show a black work truck that carries a hazardous material (HAZMAT) team, which can respond to NBC incidents, as well as other potential hazards. Various police cars, other SUVs, and motorcycles from other law enforcement agencies outside the Secret Service, along with an ambulance, accompanied the entire group. Various vans and other SUVs, including those carrying members of the traveling press pool, trailed behind. Again, you can read more about these vehicles, as well as the breakdown of a more typical presidential motorcade, in this past War Zone piece . This particular motorcade looks set to be one of a kind. Even on overseas trips, we have never seen the USSS execute this big of a procession. It’s a small, but intriguing detail from what had to of been one of the most unique inaugurations ever. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 6, 2021",Royal Air Force Turned A Torpedo Bomber Into A Flying Flamethrower During World War II,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Among the many radical and often seemingly harebrained schemes to provide aircraft with additional firepower that emerged during World War II, the British Royal Air Force’s efforts to transform a twin-engined torpedo bomber into an aerial flamethrower certainly stand out. While very few details about this particular project are available, there is at least a film of the flamethrower in action, during trials. The film , which is three minutes and 35 seconds long, was made by the RAF Film Production Unit and is dated April 1944. It begins with an aerial sequence showing a Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber carrying the flamethrower, passing at one point over an airfield. It then shifts to a clip where we see the ground crew using a trolley to transport what appears to be a purpose-made cylinder containing the fuel for the flamethrower to the aircraft. Using a mechanism built into the trolley, the ground crew raise the cylinder into the bomb bay of the aircraft. The process of loading the flamethrower device into the Beaufort., Youtube Screencap We then see the Beaufort in low-level flight, with the nozzle of the flamethrower clearly protruding from the bomb bay. As the flamethrower ignites, a jet of fire apparently several hundred feet long is left trailing behind the aircraft. A Douglas Boston , another twin-engined bomber, is seen flying alongside and a little behind the Beaufort, at a suitably safe distance. The film concludes with scenes of the burning ground and vegetation left in the aircraft’s wake. Developed for the maritime strike role, the Beaufort is today best remembered as being the precursor to the much more successful Bristol Beaufighter , which eventually replaced it. However, 2,130 Beauforts were built, 700 of which were completed in Australia, and served with the RAF in Europe and North Africa as well as in the Pacific theater. The four-seat Beaufort was powered by Bristol Taurus or Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp engines. The aircraft’s more typical primary armament consisted of a single 1,650-pound 18-inch torpedo or up to 2,000 pounds of bombs or air-dropped naval mines. Standard in-service Beaufort Mk Is of No. 42 Squadron, RAF, based at Leuchars, Scotland, around 1941., Public Domain The little information about the flamethrower project that is readily available is provided by historian Tim Mason, who has written extensively on the once-secret work of different British military aircraft trials establishments. For the Royal Air Force, the most important of these in World War II was the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, or A&AEE, which had been established at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, in 1918. In his authoritative work The Secret Years: Flight Testing at Boscombe Down, 1939–1945 , Mason recounts that a single Beaufort Mk I, serial number EK997, arrived at the establishment in late 1943, where modifications for the flamethrower trials began. The cylinder, known as an Aeroflame container, was attached to the existing torpedo rack on the Beaufort. The Beaufort may well have been chosen for the trials due to the broad similarities between this canister and the torpedo that it was originally designed to carry. The container carried 1,500 pounds of fuel for the flamethrower that was discharged through a pipe pointing to the rear and extending two feet below the rear fuselage. While Mason writes that it’s not known whether or not ignition trials took place at the A&AEE, the available film makes it clear that those tests certainly happened. Where they occurred is unclear. There is no indication in the available sources as to exactly how the Aeroflame was expected to be used had it progressed to frontline service. There are some suggestions the program was connected to fighter defense, which might suggest that aircraft equipped with it were intended to torch pursuing fighters. Earlier in the war, facing the Blitz on the United Kingdom by the German Luftwaffe, the British certainly explored some radical weapons to be used against hostile aircraft. These included aerial mines suspended from long cables that were dropped into formations of hostile aircraft, powerful airborne searchlights to illuminate bombers at night, and even an “emergency fighter,” the Miles M.20 , a cheap and easy-to-build aircraft that was completed in just nine weeks. Ground crew rolling the Aeroflame canister across the airfield prior to loading., Youtube Screencap There is a precedent for an aerial flamethrower intended to ward off enemy fighters. In September 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain , a Luftwaffe Dornier Do 17 bomber was shot down over southern England . The aircraft’s fuselage was equipped with an infantry flamethrower set up to fire rearward, controlled by the radio operator. This was a trial installation only and the flamethrower apparently failed to work at higher altitudes. The fact that the aircraft in question was shot down by an RAF Hawker Hurricane fighter approaching from the rear seems to confirm its limited utility. Either way, despite evidence that some other German bombers were also outfitted with flamethrowers for self-defense, there is no record of this being a regular occurrence or of there being any success in bringing down an intercepting fighter. A still frame from the film showing the ground crew loading the Aeroflame canister in the bomb bay of the Beaufort., Youtube Screencap In the British case, however, and in view of the film’s close shot showing small fires on the ground, it seems much more likely that the flamethrower was expected to destroy ground targets. By 1943-44, the threat posed to the United Kingdom by Luftwaffe raids was much reduced and the war in Europe was progressing on the continent. We also do know that the Aeroflame was intended to be ignited “at very low level,” further supporting the idea it was a ground-attack weapon. With this in mind, it could perhaps have been envisaged for use against enemy vehicles or troops, although the aircraft carrying it would have been notably vulnerable due to both its low-altitude approach and straight-line attack profile. That latter factor would have reduced the flexibility of the Aeroflame and the types of targets that it would actually be able to attack, primarily columns of vehicles or troops. Other potential ground targets for the flamethrower might have been rows of enemy fighters (or other aircraft) sitting unprotected on their airfields. The Aeroflame test, moments after ignition of the flamethrower., Youtube Screencap It’s not necessarily surprising that the Aeroflame did not reach operational service. The flamethrower, as a concept, is a weapon of generally limited utility, beyond its tremendous psychological impact. They have been, almost universally, short-range assault weapons that are most effective in confined areas. Longer-range flame weapons were deployed in World War II, most notably on tanks and other armored vehicles. These were mostly intended to be brought to bear on specific targets when needed, to best exploit the tactical situation, although they often required a considerable amount of time to be prepared for action. The actual range of their primary weapons was still relatively short, as well. A British Army Churchill Crocodile flamethrower tank, of the type that saw notable service in the Normandy campaign., Public Domain Perhaps the Aeroflame could have found a niche as a flying infantry support weapon during the invasion of Normandy that began in June 1944, for example, being called into action by a forward air controller. This type of application would fit with the date of the trials seen in the film. However, even in this post-D-Day role, its utility would have compared unfavorably to a flamethrower tank, which could accompany infantry and be reloaded once it had expended its fuel. Furthermore, the size and weight of the Aeroflame would likely have prevented the aircraft fitted with it from carrying alternative weapons, too, beyond basic defensive armament. In the event, more agile fighter-bombers armed with conventional bombs and air-to-ground rockets proved to be ideal in this type of close air support role. There is also the very real concern that crews would have felt hauling 1,500 pounds of highly flammable flamethrower fuel into combat. That would have made the aircraft even more vulnerable, and even more of an attractive target, a problem shared by ground-based flame weapons, too. Although it was apparently destined for failure, the Aeroflame’s development points to a fascinating effort to provide an innovative aerial weapon. The reason for its seeming disappearance from the widely available historical records remains a mystery, however. Hat tip to R. G. Poulussen for bringing this to our attention, and to Nick Stroud of The Aviation Historian for his insight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 8, 2021",The Nuclear Football Is Now Following President Joe Biden Around,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Joe Biden now has access to a special briefcase that enables whoever is President of the United States to order nuclear strikes from virtually any location at any time. Another one of these cases, colloquially known as the “ nuclear football ,” traveled with now-former President Donald Trump to Florida, where it would have remained just feet away, carried by a military aide, right until the moment when he was no longer Commander-In-Chief. The Washington Post ‘s Mike DeBonis spotted a football , of which there is more than one, entering the Capitol earlier this morning ahead of the inauguration. The ceremony officially began at around 11:15 AM, but Biden was not officially sworn in as the 46th President until later on in the event. A US military aide, at left, carries a nuclear football to a US Marine Corps VH-3D Marine One helicopter, which then-President Donald Trump used to travel from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base on Jan. 20, 2021. The Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to Florida., C-SPAN capture From the outside, the football, the aluminum Zero Halliburton briefcase , officially known as the President’s Emergency Satchel, looks like an unassuming large black bag. U.S. military aides assigned to the White House Military Office, which can be from any of the service branches and have a rank of O-4 or higher , rotate through the job of following the President around with the briefcase. Typically, when a new President is sworn in, there is effectively a direct handoff, where the aide assigned to the outgoing President would turn over the satchel to the one assigned to the new Commander-In-Chief. However, Trump’s decision not to attend the inauguration would have required changes to those plans. “There are at least three or four identical ‘footballs’: one follows the president, one follows the vice president, and one traditionally is set aside for the designated survivor at events like inaugurations and State of the Union addresses,” Stephen Schwartz, a nonresident fellow at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and an expert on American nuclear weapons programs, told CNN . “Donald Trump is president through 11:59:59 am on January 20.” “If an aide with the football accompanies Trump on Air Force One to Florida, that aide will remove himself or herself from Trump’s presence at noon and return to Washington, DC, with the briefcase,” Schwartz continued. It’s not clear who specifically the aide carrying the satchel into the Capitol this morning was assigned to, at least initially, and whether they are the one following President Biden. Former Vice President Pence also attended the ceremony, who would have had the football in tow up until Kamala Harris was sworn in as Vice President. It’s also worth noting that President Biden would have needed little instruction on how to use the football as he dealt with the burden for eight years under the Obama Administration. Vice President Harris would need some instruction, a cursory version of which is rumored to occur either prior to or just after being sworn into office. The basic concept behind the football , various iterations of which have been used over the years, dates back to President Dwight Eisenhower’s Administration, but the current practice of having it close to the President at all times came about as a product of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Then-President John F. Kennedy and his advisors were concerned about the ability to launch a nuclear retaliatory strike in the event of a launch of Soviet nuclear-armed missiles from Cuba. An older version of the football that is now part of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History’s collection.                       , Smithsonian/Jamie Chung If there is ever a need to actually use the satchel, whoever is President at the time first needs to authenticate their identity using regularly changing ‘Gold Codes’ found on a card known as the “biscuit” that they carry with them at all times. Once that is done, they can then communicate instructions for a nuclear strike to the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon and to Strategic Command . In the event that those entities are destroyed or otherwise unreachable, an extensive communications network can transmit the President’s orders to other command and control nodes, including to E-6B Mercury or E-4B airborne command post aircraft , which have the ability to transmit orders to launch nuclear strikes directly to all the arms of America’s nuclear triad. The E-6B can even directly initiate the launch of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCM) from their silos down below. When it comes to the nature of the actual strikes, the football also contains a “menu” of pre-planned nuclear response options for the President to select. The aide carrying the football is briefed on these plans and can be consulted to provide immediate advice. The Commander-In-Chief would also be in contact with other elements of the so-called National Command Authority (NCA), including the Secretary of Defense, and could consult with them, as well as others, about other potential options. However, the pre-planned options exist specifically because there might not be time to explore alternatives. For instance, after hostile ICBMs are launched, it takes time to detect and categorize them to confirm the nature of the threat. After all that, there could be as 15 minutes before the weapons reach their targets. You can read more about the specifics about the NCA and what the President has to go through to order a nuclear strike in these past War Zone pieces . The topic of the football itself had popped up numerous times during President Trump’s tenure. In February 2017, Richard DeAgazio posted a picture of himself alongside a member of the U.S. military identified as “Rick,” later identified as the aide assigned to carry the satchel that day, while at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. DeAgazio, who was simply a guest at the resort, also appeared in the infamous images of the President and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reviewing classified documents relating to a North Korean missile test in a Mar-a-Lago dining hall. Richard DeAgazio, at right, and “Rick,” at left, at Mar-a-Lago in February 2017., via Facebook In February 2018, a report emerged that there had been a physical altercation over the football during Trump’s visit to the Great Hall of the People in the Chinese capital Beijing the previous year. The actual chain of events, which took place on Nov. 9, 2017, remains murky and there is no indication that the satchel was ever in the possession of Chinese authorities. The authority to use America’s nuclear weapons, which, at present, resides entirely with the President, had been a major topic of discussion during President Trump’s Administration. In the wake of the siege of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob earlier this month, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, called Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley to discuss potential safeguards against an “unhinged” commander-in-chief ordering a nuclear strike. “The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” she wrote in a letter to her colleagues on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress had raised similar concerns in 2017, at a time of great tension between the United States and North Korea, during which Trump had made various threats toward the northeast Asian country implying the use of nuclear weapons. “We are concerned that the President of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said during a hearing on nuclear command and control that year. Beyond these issues raised by some in relation to the last administration, concerns over so much power being wielded by a single person have existed for decades. The outstanding question largely revolved around whether or not reasonable fail-safes against improper use could be implemented without negatively impacting the country’s deterrent posture. The United States also notably does not have a so-called “no first use” policy, meaning it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to especially grave, but conventional attacks. There have also been calls for a change in this policy, as well, in recent years. “I will follow any legal order that I’m given – I will not follow any illegal orders,” U.S. Navy Charles Richard, head of STRATCOM, had told reporters on Jan. 5, the day before the Capitol siege, when asked about potential nuclear strikes on Iran. “And if you go much further, if I were to say anything else, we’re starting to call in civilian control of the military, which I think is a prized American attribute.” “Fundamentally, who has the authority to do that is a political question,” he continued. “If you ask me my best military advice, the system we have served us well, for 70 years. I don’t recommend any changes, but I’m prepared to execute whatever the political leadership of this nation would like to do.” However the U.S. government’s policies regarding the employment of nuclear weapons might now change or not under the new Biden Administration, the nuclear football remains close to the Commander-In-Chief at all times. As such, it remains a symbol of continuity of government and, when a new president is inaugurated, a clear and present indication of the peaceful transfer of control over America’s most destructive weapons.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 24, 2020",Airliner Pilot Says Jet Pack Guy Over Los Angeles Looked Just Like This Crazy Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Months after an initial report from airline pilots about seeing what appeared to be an individual flying alongside them using a jet pack as they came in to land at Los Angeles International Airport, that incident , and subsequent encounters in southern California , remains as curious and unexplained as ever. Newly obtained documents from the Federal Aviation Administration show officials there were also stumped after the first sighting. At the same time, they were asking similar questions and considering one of the exact same possible explanations that we here at The War Zone have also explored . John Greenewald, a vigorous filer of Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) requests and author, who runs the website The Black Vault , received the documents through the FOIA process and generously shared them with The War Zone . You can read the documents in their entirety over at The Black Vault by clicking here . The records cover discussions between various FAA officials regarding the first of these recent jet pack-related sightings near Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, on Aug. 30, 2020. You can read more about that incident specifically in these previous War Zone stories . A video online of a remote-controlled jet pack guy has become of interest to investigators. , Youtube Screencap “MULTIPLE AIRCRAFT REPORTED MAN IN JET PACK MANEUVERING AT 3,000 FEET ON 10 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 25R,” reads a brief initial notice regarding the incident that the FAA sent out. “NO IMPACT TO OPERATIONS OR EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN. LAPD AIR SUPPORT NOTIFIED.” The initial notice that the FAA sent out about the sighting of an individual flying using a jet pack near LAX on Aug. 30, 2020., FAA via FOIA A large portion of the documents concern the back-and-forth between air traffic controllers and other FAA personnel regarding the sighting and efforts to immediately confirm whether or not it actually occurred. These records largely reiterate what has already been known thanks to publicly available air traffic control audio recordings, which you can find in this past War Zone piece . As was noted at the time, air traffic controllers did not spot anything on their radars that would match the description of what became known as the “jet pack guy.” In an Email, Ray Palmer, a Group Manager within the FAA’s Litigation Support and Enforcement Office, offered to have the raw radar data reviewed to see if that might turn up any additional information. Any further details about that portion of the investigation are not included in this batch of documents. Still, this would further confirm information The War Zone had previously received that there had been reviews of the radar tapes from around the time of previous jet pack-related encounters in the past six months, but that nothing abnormal had been found. However, the documents do include a very interesting series of Emails between Sept. 2 and Sept. 3, 2020. On Sept. 2, Victor Goodell, the Aviation Safety Manager at the Van Nuys Flight Standards District Office, sent out one Email to a group of other officials that said he had contacted David Mayman, the Chief Test Pilot at Jetpack Aviation , based in Van Nuys, California, who was skeptical of the reported sighting. “He confirmed that they have not flown for months,” Goodell wrote of his conversation with Mayman. “He stated that he does not believe there are any ‘Jetpack’ operators who could get to 3000’ and sustain it.” Victor Goodell’s Sept. 2 Email regarding the jet pack sighting., FAA via FOIA The War Zone has also raised questions about the feasibility of an individual being able to fly for any prolonged period using a jet pack at 3,000 feet. Even more interestingly, on Sept. 3, John Blanco, the Aviation Safety Manager at the Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office, responded on the same Email chain with some details about what the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had turned up. The FBI has been leading the investigation into the incident since shortly after the initial report. “Mike Bumberger, our LEAP [ Law Enforcement Assistance Program ] Agent shared that the FBI interviewed the American Airlines pilot that made the jetpack sighting,” Blanco wrote. “The pilot said what he saw was exactly like the drone in the Youtube video below.” This is the video linked in Blanco’s Email: The War Zone included this exact video as one possible explanation for these sightings in a piece after video footage of another encounter between a student pilot and a “jet pack guy” off Palos Verdes in December 2020 surfaced online. You can read our full report on that incident here . As The War Zone ‘s Tyler Rogoway wrote at that time: It is possible that this is some sort of a drone dressed up to look like a guy in a jet pack, as seen in the video below. Then the question becomes why would someone be doing this? What could possibly be worth the risk? Also, it’s not like executing such a feat would be a cheap or simple operation. In this case, the craft wasn’t even flying over a populated area, it was out to sea where there are far fewer eyes to even recognize it. It’s interesting to note that Bumberger, the agent from LEAP, which is situated within the FAA’s Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety, or ASH, was also involved in the investigation into reports of mysterious drone swarm activity in eastern Colorado and neighboring parts of Nebraska and Kansas between December 2019 and January 2020. You can read more about that episode and what is known about it in this past War Zone piece . The newly released jet pack-related documents also include discussions between FAA officials regarding a video posted on Facebook on Sept. 8, 2020, of another possible sighting of a “jet pack guy.” That clip, seen below, purportedly shows the object in question, which does appear to be the general size and shape of a person, flying near the cities of Cudahy and South Gate, to the southeast of downtown Los Angeles. It’s not clear when this video was shot and its provenance is unconfirmed. Still, Blanco, the Aviation Safety Manager at the Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office, noted in a Email after receiving a link to the clip that “Ten mile final (basica ly [sic]) [to LAX]… Cudahy is right in line with where the [Aug. 30] sighting was.” He also attached an annotated satellite image showing the approximate location of the August 2020 encounter. Los Angeles Flight Standards District Office Aviation Safety Manager John Blanco’s Email regarding the video that emerged online in September 2020., FAA via FOIA There is no discussion within the documents released via FOIA about any further investigation into this video. All told, the case of the “jet pack guy” seems to be very much open from what we know now. It’s still interesting to know that FAA officials investigating the matter have been exploring similar and, in some cases, identical avenues to try to solve this mystery. While a drone dressed-up to look like a jet pack guy remains one theory, we still have no conclusive idea as to what or who the elusive Los Angeles rocketeer actually is.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 2, 2021",The Ultimate Guide To Surveillance Aircraft Available To Help Safeguard The Inauguration,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With so many uncertainties surrounding the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden following the deadly storming of the Capitol by pro-Trump demonstrators on January 6, one thing is for certain—it is likely to become the most heavily surveilled major domestic event in American history, especially from the air. Over the last two decades, as aerial surveillance technology has steadily matured, driven by various conflicts abroad, overhead surveillance has become increasingly commonplace during major high-profile events and pointed law-enforcement actions back in the homeland. From rural areas along the border to major cities, federal and even military aerial assets have been put to use to help accomplish high-stakes missions. This, of course, goes beyond local police helicopters and light fixed-wing aircraft equipped with spotlights and commercial-grade electro-optical and infrared systems. Increasingly often, far more exotic payloads are being carried aloft of the American citizens’ heads, many of which were products of lessons learned during the initial stages of the Global War on Terror. A Cessna 182T aircraft linked to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and equipped with a video camera-equipped sensor turret., AP So, with over 25,000 National Guard troops , thousands more active-duty military personnel, and throngs of law enforcement from an alphabet soup of agencies patrolling the nation’s capital, the powers that be are also bound to apply their newest and most capable aerial assets to the mission. While the airspace around the National Capital Region (NCR), which encompasses the District of Columbia and various adjacent areas, will be almost completely sanitized of commercial and civilian traffic, a stack of surveillance assets the likes of which we may never have seen before will likely be orbiting overhead, sucking up all types of data, and communicating with a bustling command post down below. A view of the preparations underway at the U.S. Capitol building ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration., AP With that said, here is an overview of what types of aircraft with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will likely be part of this massive and historic security undertaking, from the obscure to the more mundane. We can start with the active military. Legally, there are significant restrictions on when and how elements of the U.S. military at the federal level can conduct any kind of operations domestically, including providing aerial ISR support to law enforcement agencies, something The War Zone has covered in detail in the past . There are also limitations in the circumstances under which elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community, including active and reserve components of the U.S. military that fly ISR aircraft, can target U.S. citizens directly , something that presents additional legal hurdles. ISR aircraft assigned to active-duty units have been used domestically in the past, but most commonly as part of responses to major natural disasters. For instance, U.S. Air Force U-2 Dragon Lady spy planes and RQ-4 Global Hawk drones have been employed to track the spread of wildfires in the past and OC-135B Open Skies surveillance planes collected visual imagery to help assess damage after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. A composite image of the Poomacha Fire in southern California in 2007 stitched together from infrared pictures taken by US Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk drones. , USAF That being said, there are certainly examples of active-duty U.S. military aerial ISR assets supporting the security posture around very high-profile domestic events – which the U.S. government terms National Special Security Events (NSSE) and is a category that the inauguration certainly falls into – as well as helping law enforcement agencies respond to especially significant crimes. U.S. Army RC-12 Guardrail signals intelligence (SIGINT) aircraft notably flew patrols around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. That same year, that service deployed an RC-12Q , a variant that also featured high-bandwidth satellite communications relay capabilities, to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to track suspects in the Beltway Sniper shootings , which occurred in the greater Washington, D.C. area, by their cell phone signals. A US Army RC-12Q Guardrail aircraft., US Army When it comes to the inauguration, smaller turboprop ISR aircraft, such as the Army’s latest MC-12S family or similarly configured Beechcraft King Air aircraft within the U.S. special operations community, could be particularly useful for keeping an eye on things. The U.S. military now often employs contractors, including for certain domestic operations, such as border patrol , which fly other similarly-sized ISR-configured types that wear civilian registrations. A contractor-owned and operated Cessna light aircraft equipped with a camera turret containing electro-optical and infrared cameras of that type have conducted domestic border surveillance operations on behalf of the US military., JTF-N via FOIA Many of these aircraft are equipped with sensor turrets containing electro-optical and infrared video cameras for keeping tabs on what’s going on down below, as well as SIGINT packages, primarily intended for monitoring communications chatter. Certain SIGINT systems could also potentially be used to spot, geolocate, and categorize other emitters, such as the control systems for small unmanned aerial vehicle, a type of potential threat that has only become more concerning in recent years . Aircraft carrying wide-area airborne surveillance (WAAS) systems, a groundbreaking technology that was born out of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, will also likely be used to collect streaming video of large parts of D.C. at once. This information could then help establish an understanding of the activities, or “patterns of life,” of groups leading up to any major crisis that may occur before, during, or after the inauguration. In fact, there are few domestic missions as relevant to game-changing WAAS technology as the inauguration. Its nearly panoptic gaze over a huge area can spot groups of protestors or nefarious actors as they gather, as well as large infrared events, like explosions — via automatic recognition and tracking software or manually — and allow commanders on the ground to rapidly respond in kind. The same can be said for other abnormalities that occur throughout a large geographical area within the WAAS’s systems wide purview. WAAS-equipped aircraft can also help target areas where aircraft with traditional ‘soda straw view’ electro-optical and infrared cameras are needed to take a closer look, but they can do this faster under most instances, as they do not need to reposition themselves to do so, they simply ‘zoom in’ on the data they are already collecting. Even keeping critical routes clear for major ground movements and contingency operations would be something a WAAS-equipped aircraft can help with better than most any other airborne asset. An annotated satellite map of the greater Washington, D.C. area showing the imaging “footprint” of wide-area sensors compared to more traditional full-motion video cameras as of around 2006. Aerial wide-area surveillance capabilities have only improved since then., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Examples of wide-area surveillance imagery collected using the Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) system developed by BAE Systems under contract to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This project was subsequently transitioned to the US Air Force and became Increment 2 of that service’s Gorgon Stare program., DARPA Most of these aircraft also have data-links that can pass video and other information they collect on to individuals operating down below or tertiary sites on the ground in near-real-time. Those same links can often be used to relay data and communications over extended ranges, as well. Helicopters assigned to active-duty units, such as the UH-60 Black Hawks and UH-72 Lakotas assigned to the Army’s 12th Aviation Battalion at Davison Army Airfield at Fort Belvoir in Virginia or the UH-1N Twin Hueys of the Air Force’s 1st Helicopter Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, could also contribute to the ISR ecosystem in support of the inauguration. Even helicopters without camera-laden sensor turrets could still perform visual surveillance flights, if necessary. At the same time, the 12th Aviation Battalion and the 1st Helicopter Squadron, among other helicopter-equipped units situated around the NCR have important Continuity of Government missions. As such, they will also be standing by to help rush President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and other important U.S. officials to safety in the event a major crisis or contingency develops before, during, or after the inauguration. You can read more about the U.S. government’s Continuity of Government planning in this past War Zone piece . One of Davidson Army Airfield’s ‘gold top’ VIP configured UH-60s seen with a sensor ball below its nose., US Army It’s important to note there’s generally significant demand for dedicated ISR aircraft, which are also often in relatively short supply, too. This often limits the availability of active-duty assets for domestic operations, even without getting into the legal hurdles. However, the National Guard, which occupies a very different legal space when not operating under the direct control of the federal government, is postured to provide more routine ISR support to domestic activities. For instance, Air National Guard RC-26B Condors, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , often work with domestic law enforcement agencies, particularly in regards to counter-narcotics operations. There are multiple RC-26B subvariants and the ones that carry electro-optical and infrared video camera-equipped sensor turrets are most commonly deployed domestically, though other examples are fitted with SIGINT packages. Some of these aircraft have also carried radars with synthetic aperture imaging functionality, capable of taking still images, day or night, and in almost any weather, in the past, as well. A subvariant of the RC-26B equipped with electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras in a turret under the fuselage., National Guard Bureau The camera-equipped versions were notably employed over Washington, D.C. in 2020 in response to protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. RC-26B flights were also carried out in Arizona, California, and Minnesota to monitor similar protests. The use of these aircraft in those instances was controversial. A subsequent investigation by the Office of the Inspector General of the Air Force determined that, while the aircraft did not gather personal information on any individuals, a possibility that had prompted concerns among members of Congress and civil liberties groups , the National Guard Bureau had improperly approved the flights , to begin with. There are MC-12W Liberty aircraft, similar in many respects to the Army’s RC-12 and MC-12 fleets, within the Air National Guard, as well. As with their active-duty counterparts, helicopters, especially from Army National Guard units, could also conduct surveillance flights. There may be some reticence to make any prominent use of National Guard helicopters in support of the inauguration given the backlash to the extremely controversial and potentially dangerous employment of D.C. Army National Guard UH-60s and UH-72s to try to disperse groups protesting in the District after George Floyd’s death last year. You can read more about that incident, and the subsequent investigation, in these past War Zone stories . It’s also worth noting that U.S. Air Force fighter jets, including the D.C. Air National Guard’s F-16C/D Vipers that stand alert every day to protect the nation’s capital , carry targeting pods equipped with electro-optical and infrared video cameras. In the Homeland Defense role , these are primarily used to help identify aircraft and other potential aerial threats at extended ranges. However, they also provide a secondary ISR capability. As such, F-16C/Ds, as well as F-15C/Ds Eagles called up from other units that might also be called upon to fly combat air patrols during the inauguration, could be called upon to fly so-called “non-traditional” ISR missions, or NTISR, in support of contingency on the ground. Air National Guard F-16C/Ds are also increasingly being equipped with AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), an active electronically-scanned array type you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . The DC National Guard Vipers were the first to get rushed this capability due to their high-stakes air sovereignty mission. SABR offers synthetic aperture imaging and ground moving target indicator functionality in addition to improved capabilities when searching for and tracking aerial targets, especially low flying cruise missiles and drones, which are becoming an increasingly dire concern . An F-16C Viper from the Washington, D.C. Air National Guard’s 113th Fighter Wing., DC ANG The entire integrated air defense network around the NCR will be on high alert for any kind of contingency during the inauguration. In addition to fighter jets, E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft customarily watch the skies, while National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems ( NASAMS ) and Avenger point-defense systems will sit ready on the ground, all backed up by a large sensor network distributed throughout the NCR. You can read more about the air defenses that ring the NCR in these past War Zone pieces . The U.S. Coast Guard, which occupies a unique position as the only uniformed U.S. military service outside of the Department of Defense, is part of this equation, too. It has MH-65 helicopters based at Reagan International Airport, which are also part of the air defense posture in the NCR, being regularly used to intercept and identify lower-and-slower-flying potential threats. These could also be used to conduct air-to-ground surveillance flights, both through visual means and using the camera-equipped turrets under their noses. A US Coast Guard MH-65 helicopter flies down the Potomac River past the Washington Monument. , USCG A multitude of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies will also be supporting the inauguration. Many of them have aircraft, including both fixed-wing types and helicopters, that could be used for surveillance missions, as well as certain other kinds of intelligence-gathering, if required. There are too many specific aircraft types and configurations to cover each one individually, but what we saw in response to the protests emanating from George Floyd’s killing and other incidents last year offers insight into what we might expect to see during the inauguration. Just over Washington, D.C., there were flights by Dash-8 turboprops belonging to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), as well as a Cessna Citation business jet and a Cessna Caravan turboprop, both linked to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The CBP Dash-8s, designed primarily for over-water surveillance, carry electro-optical and infrared video cameras in a sensor turret along with a surface search radar. CBP’s Beechcraft King Air-based Multi-role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA), which were also employed to monitor protests elsewhere across the country last year, offer these same general capabilities, but in a smaller and more modular package. A US Customs and Border Protection Dash-8 surveillance aircraft., CBP A US Customs and Border Protection Multi-role Enforcement Aircraft (MEA)., CBP One of CBP’s Reaper drones was also sent to monitor protests in Minneapolis in relation to the death of George Floyd last year, but the agency subsequently said that it returned to base without collecting any video footage after it was “determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP’s Reapers are all unarmed, but have sensor turrets with full-motion video cameras under their noses. CBP also has versions that are equipped with surface search radars, primarily for overwater operations, while other specialized bolt-on radars are sensitive to track individuals’ movements . US Customs and Border Protection Reaper drones., CBP The exact configurations of the FBI-linked Citation and the Caravan seen last year over the nation’s capital are unknown. It is likely these aircraft also carry some combination of cameras and could also be equipped with systems design to intercept, geolocate, and track cell phone and other communications signals. CBP and FBI, among other federal agencies, operate additional types of fixed-wing aircraft that may have other ISR capabilities, including wide-area surveillance sensors. These aircraft also generally have their own data-links that can send information to ‘customers’ on the ground in near-real-time. Nearby state or local authorities might provide additional capacity in this regard, as well. Authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, just to the northeast of D.C., have notably been experimenting with aircraft equipped with wide-area surveillance systems in recent years, something that has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups concerned that these flights could gather mountains of information about individuals who are not suspected of having committed a crime. It’s worth noting that many of these fixed-wing aircraft supporting law enforcement agencies are operated, and sometimes even owned entirely , by contractors or can be registered through front companies to obscure their ownership and origin. Beyond fixed-wing types, law enforcement agencies also operate a wide variety of helicopters, many of which carry their own video camera-filled turrets. Not surprisingly, just in the past week or so, there has been an uptick in sightings of CBP AS350s with exactly these kinds of sensor systems. The helicopters CBP has deployed notably include examples painted in more discreet civilian-type liveries in addition to ones wearing its official blue-and-white paint scheme. A CBP AS350 helicopter wearing the agency’s standard blue-and-white paint scheme flies over Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, ahead of Super Bowl LIII in 2019., CBP The U.S. Park Police’s helicopters are frequently seen flying over the District of Columbia on any given day and will certainly be airborne during the inauguration. State and local police departments, including D.C.’s own Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and those in neighboring Maryland and Virginia, also have helicopters that are likely to be seen zipping about, too. All of these aircraft are equipped with their own sensors, usually including a FLIR system. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a Congressional watchdog, on aviation noise concerns in and around the District of Columbia provides more detailed information about the kinds of law enforcement helicopters that routinely operate in the area.

These helicopters, some of which are based at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, are part of NNSA’s Aerial Measuring System (AMS).

This appears to a be new measure that domestic law enforcement agencies are taking for high-priority missions. As such, during major events, oftentimes aircraft are orbiting overhead in plain sight that cannot be seen on flight trackers while others nearby can. This was the case in multiple locations in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. While the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States is historic for a number of reasons, one of them will be just how many assets have been activated to surveil the security situation leading up to, during, and after the ceremony. Following the explosion of aerial surveillance assets being used domestically across the country that we saw this summer in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, the inauguration of Joe Biden is very likely to continue with that trend to an even more extreme degree. Of course, some of this depends on the weather and the exact disposition of the security situation at the time. While these may be special circumstances, the use of these types of aircraft and their sleuthing payloads is only set to increase in frequency and magnitude in the years to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the latest setback for the U.S. Navy’s troubled Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship , the service has decided to suspend further deliveries of the warships until a persistent problem with the transmission is finally ironed out. Industry journal Defense News reported today that the Navy had confirmed to them that “a material defect” in the transmission on the Freedom class would have to be fixed before any more of the warships are accepted for service. As it stands, 10 examples of the Freedom class have been delivered, with another five under construction or in the process of fitting out, and one more example is on order, too. The news follows an incident last October when the Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) USS Detroit suffered a significant breakdown while operating in the waters around Latin America. You can read all about the related events here . The Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship USS Detroit, which suffered a well-publicized “engineering casualty” last October., U.S. Navy A failure of the combining gear, a part of the ship’s drive train, was thought to be the cause of the October incident and it’s a design flaw in the same feature that has led to the Navy’s latest decision. The combining gear, which has been a source of problems on multiple occasions in the past, links the two main diesel engines on the Freedom class ships to a pair of gas turbines, which can provide additional power for its water jet propulsion system. This combined system is key to the ability of these ships to reach speeds of over 40 knots, which was a core requirement when the ships were under development. On diesel engine power alone, their top speed is only around 10 to 12 knots . Previous incidents involving the troublesome combining gear also occurred in 2015, when the USS Milwaukee suffered a problem with this part of its propulsion system while making its maiden voyage to Naval Station Mayport in Florida, where Detroit is also homeported. The following year, USS Fort Worth experienced a significant breakdown in its combining gear, as well. The Navy subsequently determined that incident to have been the result of a chain of errors by the crew that resulted in the system running for an extended period without critical lubricating oil. Last December, as concerns about the combining gear grew, the Navy told Defense News that the government was “investigating a material defect with the combining gear of USS Detroit and USS Little Rock , both Freedom -variant Littoral Combat Ships.” The same statement noted that a joint Navy and Lockheed Martin team was working with RENK AG, the original equipment manufacturer, to find the root cause of the defect. The USS Little Rock underway in the Caribbean Sea, in February 2020. The LCS was deployed to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility to support Campaign Martillo, an effort targeting illicit trafficking routes in coastal waters around Central America., U.S. Navy/Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Marianne Guemo The Navy has now told Defense News that it’s working on a fix to address Freedom class LCSs already in service, while new hulls will begin to be delivered again once this has been introduced. However, an anonymous senior Navy official told the same publication that the fix is likely to take months to install on each ship. Although the Independence class LCSs are of a separate design, they too have been dogged by problems with their propulsion systems. Ships from both subclasses have been involved in various mishaps, over the years, as well. This catalog of reliability issues has led to the Navy conducting only very limited operational deployments of its two LCS fleets, ever since the first-in-class USS Freedom , also known as LCS 1, was commissioned more than a decade ago. In 2018, for example, not a single LCS from either subclass was deployed operationally anywhere . Last September, the Navy began its latest initiative to try to and get more valuable service out of its LCSs. This involved sending the Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport USNS Burlington to the U.S. 4th Fleet area to serve as a mothership for Detroit and other LCSs in the region. A Maintenance Expeditionary Team onboard the Burlington was available to work on the ships while at sea, hopefully reducing the number of port visits required for more intensive repairs. The Spearhead class expeditionary fast transport vessel USNS Burlington (T-EPF-10) departs Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia, last September 26, in support of a three-month deployment in U.S. Southern Command’s area of responsibility, serving as an afloat forward staging base style platform to maintain various LCSs., U.S. Navy/LaShawn Sykes Aside from that, the LCSs also pack only fairly modest combat capabilities. While there exists a Navy initiative to provide an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile capability, so far only the Gabrielle Giffords has actually received the RGM-184A Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and this effort has also faced its own set of problems . It has been suggested that some of the LCSs might eventually also receive laser weapons . The Independence class LCS USS Gabrielle Giffords together with an interdicted narco-submarine, during counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific last December., U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Allen Michael Amani As for the first two LCSs in each subclass, these were produced with such considerable differences compared to subsequent members of their respective classes that the Navy has now begun looking at options to retire them entirely . As it is, these four vessels are currently only deemed fit for training and test and evaluation , a result of the concurrency procurement concept that has affected other Department of Defense programs too, and which you can read more about here . Ultimately, while the Navy has announced plans to build an entirely new class of more capable frigates, the first of which uses a design from an Italian shipbuilder , it has so far chosen to stick with its LCSs, despite their various shortcomings. The service will no doubt be hoping that, once a long-term fix has been devised for the Freedom class, both subclasses of LCS will eventually finally fulfill even a portion of their hoped-for potential.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jun 11, 2021",Australia Reportedly Looking At An Alternative To Its Costly New French-Designed Submarines,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Australia’s plans to introduce 12 advanced new Attack class submarines may have hit a new snag. The huge cost of the French-designed conventional submarines, which will likely feature air-independent propulsion and other advanced technologies, means that officials may be examining whether they might instead replace the Royal Australian Navy’s six existing Collins class boats with an updated version of this same design. The Australian Financial Review recently reported that the Australian government is considering scrapping the current contract with French shipbuilder Naval Group. That conglomerate, then known as DCNS, won the Collins class replacement program, also known as SEA1000, in 2016 with its Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A design. You can read all about how the final stages of that competition played out, and the rivals to the French design, in this previous War Zone feature. Subsequently dubbed the Attack class, these submarines are presently due to enter service in the early 2030s and will feature a significant proportion of U.S.-made systems installed, including a version of the AN/BYG-1 Submarine Payload Control System . An artist’s concept of the new Attack class submarine for the Royal Australian Navy., DCNS Prime Minister Scott Morrison is reportedly increasingly unhappy with the way the Attack class program has been run so far, with “cost blowouts and missed deadlines” leading to apparent tensions between the Australian Department of Defense and the Naval Group, according to the Australian Financial Review . The project is now valued at around $69 billion. Back in 2016, when the Naval Group was selected, the program cost was expected to be in the region of $40 billion. These concerns seem to have escalated as far as talks on the subject between Morrison and French President Emmanuel Macron. The French government holds a controlling stake in the Naval Group. “I don’t think the [French] submarine is guaranteed to be built,” an unnamed source told the Australian Financial Review . “Naval Group is still holding the design work and intellectual property in France and the Commonwealth is annoyed.” There are also worries about the involvement of the wider Australian industry, or the lack thereof. All 12 submarines are set to be built at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in South Australia. Under a Strategic Partnering Agreement, 60 percent of all the work on the program, by cost, was supposed to be invested in local suppliers. However, a commitment to this from both the defense department and Naval Group missed its deadline at the end of last year as negotiations continue. “If Defence and Naval Group cannot reach a satisfactory contract amendment in a timely fashion for something that the company publicly committed to and is supposedly subjected to Ministerial oversight, then what confidence can Australian industry, particularly the small to medium enterprises, have that they will be able to compete in a fair and equitable manner for meaningful work on this program,” Brent Clark, Chief Executive Officer at Australian Industry & Defence Network, told the Australian Financial Review . These are not the first problems that the program has run into. The original contract, and how the Australian government handled subsequent negotiations with the Naval Group, previously led to significant controversy and has been threatened in the past with a formal inquiry . As an alternative to the Attack class, the Australian government is now apparently considering the possibility of having Naval Group Australia — a local subsidiary of the French designer — build a new class of submarines that would be based on the aging Collins class design, the first example of which entered service in 1996. Freeing the project of some of the controls of the French parent company could help bring down costs and otherwise increase transparency in the project, which involves one of the biggest international defense contracts in recent history. However, it is unclear how the alternative design would compare to the Attack class, and what compromises might have to be made in terms of capabilities and performance. Collins class submarines HMAS Collins , HMAS Farncomb , HMAS Dechaineux , and HMAS Sheean off the coast of Western Australia., Australian Department of Defense So far, the Attack class program has reached the detailed design phase, in which the winning Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A design are to be refined and plans and specifications for the Australian version drawn up. The Australian Financial Review says that while this phase was expected to cost $1.9 billion, this is now thought to have risen to $2.3 billion, contributing to the current concerns about the overall feasibility of the project. “As work on the design of the Future Submarine progresses, Naval Group are finalizing their proposal for the next phase in cooperation with [the Australian Department of Defense] Defense to ensure uninterrupted work on the Attack class,” a spokesperson for that department told Australian Financial Review in a statement. Should Australia now turn to an evolved Collins class design — known informally as the “Son of Collins” — it would rekindle its relationship with the Swedish firm Kockums, whose parent company Saab now owns the design rights to the submarine. For their part, Saab/Kockums was not among the companies involved in the final bidding for the Collins class replacement, but they have plenty of experience building advanced conventional submarines, including the much-vaunted Gotland class . This design, which also features an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, was built for the Swedish Navy and one example was leased by the U.S. Navy in the mid-2000s as a dedicated aggressor. The “Son of Collins” idea is not new. Back in 2015, before narrowing down the Collins class replacement program to three contenders, the Australian Department of Defense rejected a revised Collins class design on the ground that it was not worth the cost and risk involved. Furthermore, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , it was considered that Kockums “weren’t up to the job since they hadn’t built a submarine for many years.” Now, however, Australian Financial Review reports that Australian Defense Minister Linda Reynolds has not denied the possibility of beginning talk with Saab about a potential alternative to the Attack class. “As the original designer of the Collins class submarine, Saab Kockums has an ongoing relationship with [the Australian Submarine Corporation] supporting the life of type extension program for the Collins class submarine,” she said. One of the Swedish Navy’s Gotland class submarines. , Saab Kockums is also still involved in the Royal Australian Navy’s submarine program, providing ongoing support for a life-extension program that is intended to keep the original Collins class boats viable until their planned successors are in service. As such, a relationship between the two firms that could field an alternative to the Attack class is already in place. There may be other customers in the market for just such an evolved Collins design, too. Saab is currently in the running to supply the Netherlands with a new submarine class and that country has broadly similar requirements to the Australians. Were both Australia and the Netherlands to opt for this “Son of Collins” design, both could benefit from the resulting economies of scale. The Royal Netherlands Navy’s Walrus class submarines are due for replacement around 2025. Naval Group, Saab, and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems are all in the running to provide successors., U.S. Navy The Royal Australian Navy badly needs an advanced submarine to ensure the security of its strategic sea-lines-of-communication in an Indo-Pacific region with no shortage of potential flashpoints and chokepoints . As Australia invests in its military to maintain a qualitative and quantitative edge over its regional rivals, its submarine fleet will be expected to conduct missions such as patrolling the South China Sea, where a fast-growing People’s Liberation Army Navy is increasingly assertive both above and below the water. The sheer cost of the Collins class replacement program has always been eye-watering, but the total includes research and development, integration of combat systems, setting up indigenous production, and support infrastructure, meaning that a price tag of $8 billion per hull is not strictly accurate. That doesn’t necessarily mean that Australia made the right choice to start with, however. Back in 2016, when Naval Group won the contract, The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway commented: “The truth is that diesel-electric submarines with advanced AIP capability can be had for around $500-$700 million a boat if bought directly from a manufacturer such as Germany’s Thyssen Krupp. Even Israel’s highly modified Dolphin II class of submarines cost around $500 million each. But the Shortfin Barracuda is a much larger boat than the Dolphin II and is packed with additional combat capacity and features. Most importantly, it will end up being a relatively new design built in an entirely different country than its origin. It will also feature American combat systems.” The size of the Attack class certainly contributes to its cost. However, the Royal Australian Navy is familiar with operating larger submarines. The current Collins class has a nearly 3,500-ton displacement, while the Attack class is planned to have a displacement of over 4,000 tons. Although exact specifications are not yet available, the French-designed submarines will be around 295 feet long, compared to 254 feet for the Collins class. On the other hand, the rival German Type 216 submarine that lost out in the SEA1000 bidding would have cost half as much but would have been comparable in size to the Attack class. At this point, many of the details of the Attack class are yet to be confirmed. However, we can be sure that they will be tailored for operations at long range, with the ability to move at high speeds when necessary. The exact nature of the propulsion technology to be used is unclear, but there have been rumors the submarines may use French fuel cell systems. Consideration is already being given to new battery technology that could offer significantly improved performance and may potentially replace traditional lead-acid batteries, in the same way that Japan has opted for lithium-ion batteries in its latest class of submarines. Another view of the planned Attack class submarine., Royal Australian Navy Ultimately, Australia demanded a submarine that was a close as possible to a nuclear-powered design in terms of capabilities, but with conventional propulsion. So in some ways, the most logical choice was the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A, based on a scaled-down version of the nuclear-powered Barracuda design that is now entering French Navy service. That decision should result in a submarine that easily meets Australian requirements, but one that comes with a hefty price tag that seems disproportionate. France, for example, is paying a reported $10.2 billion for its six Barracudas, which, even taking into account subsidies, seems to be in a different league to the $69-billion Australian program. The addition of U.S.-made systems in the Australian submarines potentially also adds cost and complexity to the Australian submarines. It now remains to be seen whether the Australian government is prepared to burden the costs of its highly advanced French-designed submarines, or whether it will be willing to trade them for a cheaper option.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A photo has emerged of the Israeli Navyâ€™s Saâ€™ar 5 class corvette Lahav armed with two Iron Dome air defense system launchers, apparently for the first time. This comes as Israel continues to be on a heightened state of alert as tensions with Iran grow, and amid reports that Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen now possess Iranian-supplied â€œ suicide drones â€ capable of reaching targets within the country. The photo of the Lahav is not dated and shows the pair of launchers fitted to the shipâ€™s flight deck at the stern. We have previously seen this ship with a single Iron Dome launcher on this aft deck. You can see the photo further down in this article. All three of the Israeli Navyâ€™s Saâ€™ar 5 class corvettes underway., Israel Defense Forces In its basic form, the Iron Dome system consists of launchers firing fast and agile Tamir interceptors , as well as associated air defense radars. The system is primarily designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells, but can also be used against lower-flying aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles , as well. Tamir has an active radar seeker to home in on its targets and receives additional targeting information in flight via a data link to get near its target and make it even more effective. Crucial to its ability to defeat trickier targets is a highly advanced proximity fuse system, able to detect a small and fast-flying target and detonate the missileâ€™s high-explosive blast-fragmentation warhead with perfect timing in order to destroy it. You can read more about exactly how the weapon works in this previous article, as well as the U.S. Armyâ€™s limited acquisition of it, here .Â Images of twin Iron Dome batteries onboard the Israeli Navy corvette Lahav ( linked here Â if the tweet does not propagate below) : Interesante imagen de la INS Lahav (Sa'ar 5) cargando dos baterÃ­as Iron Dome a popa.

C-Dome employs the interceptor missiles, vertical launchers, and other components from the land-based battle management center, together with the shipâ€™s own surveillance radar. It had been already reported that the Lahav would serve as a testbed for the new class of warships. However, unlike the Saâ€™ar 5 Â ships, the Saâ€™ar 6 class will carry the Iron Dome missiles in fully-integrated vertical launch system arrays. You can read more about these very capable ships â€” the first of which was handed over in an as-yet unarmed configuration last month â€” in this previous War Zone article. Still, it is hard to imagine what type of test would require two launchers and their magazines instead of one. The land-based version of the Iron Dome intercepts a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip., Israel Defense Forces The dual Iron Dome launchers on Lahav could also be related to a test of a new configuration for the Saâ€™ar 5s or be an actual operational fit for these ships. Israel did declare initial operational capability with C-Dome on these corvettes in 2017. While not as big or as advanced as the forthcoming Saâ€™ar 6 class, the Israeli Navyâ€™s three Saâ€™ar 5 Â boats are still highly capable. These American-built corvettes were acquired in the mid-1990s. They measure 281 feet long and have a displacement of 1,255 long tons fully loaded. The Saâ€™ar 5 class ships are equipped with the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR multifunction active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar developed by IAIâ€™s Elta division and known as â€œAdirâ€ in Israeli service that can automatically track and engage the full spectrum of aerial threats, from aircraft to sea-skimming missiles, at ranges up to 124 miles. Normal armament comprises Barak surface-to-air missiles, Harpoon or Gabriel anti-ship missiles, and a Mk 15 Phalanx 20mm close-in weapon system (CIWS). Israeli officials recently confirmed that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had moved both Iron Dome and long-range Patriot missile defense batteries to the city of Eilat on the countryâ€™s Red Sea coast. While there was no confirmation that sea-based Iron Dome launchers were part of that deployment, the two launchers aboard Lahav would certainly provide additional anti-rocket and artillery capabilities to the coastal town. Having two launchers aboard also points to this being more than a test program, with an apparent focus on providing additional magazine depth, at the expense of the ability to embark a helicopter. So equipped, the vessel could serve as an anti-air screen to defend against drones and cruise missiles launched from a surface vessel in the Red Sea or lands far to the south, swatting them down before they approach Israeli borders. Similarly, if Israel sees the potential threat of a drone or missile launch from the Mediterranean, the vessel could offer the same capabilities. Hezbollah has sent drones over Israel by way of a route along the shore of Lebanon and into Israel before, as well. Regardless, additional air defense systems were first reported to have been deployed Eilat around the first anniversary of the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iranâ€™s Quds Force, in the U.S. drone strike that killed him in Baghdad, Iraq on January 3, 2020. Israel has also been bracing itself for possible actions by Iran or its proxies, in revenge for the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, described as the â€œ father of Iranâ€™s nuclear bomb .â€œ Fakhrizadeh was reportedly killed by Israelâ€™s top intelligence agency Mossad, or individuals working on its behalf, in a complex attack on the car he was traveling in last November 30. Iran has vowed that it will respond in kind to these two killings.

The Houthi rebels â€” whom the United States recently decided to designate as a terrorist group â€” seized control of much of the west of Yemen in 2015, after which a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadiâ€™s rule. Iran has been a consistent backer of the rebel group, its assistance likely behind the groupâ€™s ability to employ ballistic missiles , anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles, and remote-controlled suicide boats , as well as suicide drones. An earlier type of Iranian-made suicide drone, the Qasef-1, one of several examples that have been interdicted or captured in Yemen., CONFLICT ARMAMENT RESEARCH The Houthis had previously launched high-profile attacks against targets belonging to Saudi Arabia, their other major antagonist in the region. In 2019, they claimed to have struck Saudi oil infrastructure , reportedly using Iranian-supplied drones and cruise missiles, and there have also been successive attacks on tankers in the Red Sea, most recently in December . The exact origin of those attacks is still hotly debated, with many thinking they emanated from Iran itself or from sites along the Iraqi border with Saudi Arabia. In a major exercise last week, Iran displayed delta-winged drones bearing a striking resemblance to those that were used in the attacks on the Saudi oil infrastructure.

You can read all about that incident here . While Iran has repeatedly denied allegations that it has supplied the Houthis with missiles, drones, and training, recent reports suggest that the rebels now have Iranian-made Shahed-136 loitering munitions, or â€œsuicide dronesâ€ in their inventory. With a purported range of between 1,240 and 1,370 miles, these weapons would be able to reach Israel, as well as targets within the wider region, including U.S. bases, and shipping in the Red Sea. The analysis of the new suicide drones was based on images obtained by Newsweek and confirmed to the magazine by an anonymous expert, but there is little other hard evidence available. Reportedly dating from late December, the images apparently show the Shahed-136 drones in Houthi-controlled territory in the northern Yemeni province of al-Jawf. My latest EXCLUSIVE: Intelligence seen by @Newsweek appears to show that Iran positions ""suicide drones"" in Yemen amid a rise in Red Sea tensions. The Shahed-136 UAVs appear to be in Al-Jawf, where they have a range of 2000 to 2200 kilometers. https://t.co/aQrh7zvLeK pic.twitter.com/VMvHeC6SxG — ğ•‹om ğ•†'â„‚onnor (@ShaolinTom) January 14, 2021 Last month, IDF Spokesperson Hidai Zilberman was quoted by the Times of Israel as having told a Saudi news outlet that, while Israel was not aware of any specific Iranian plans to attack Israel, there remained the possibility of an attack by Iranian proxies operating in Iraq or Yemen. He mentioned the threat posed by Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles and â€œsmart missilesâ€ deployed in these other countries.Â Zilberman added that Israel had information indicating Iran was developing unmanned aerial vehicles and â€œsmart missilesâ€ in Iraq and Yemen, and that the weapons could have the ability to strike Israel. This is where the Iron Dome-equipped corvette may come in. Overall, if reports are accurate, the deployment of Shahed-136 drones in Yemen would be in line with an increased Iranian military presence around the Red Sea. Speaking last week, the Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, said that Iran planned to send warships to patrol these waters. â€œWe are once again in the region of the Red Sea, where the Islamic Republicâ€™s merchant vessels have faced some limited aggression in recent times,â€ Bagheri said. â€œWe will deploy our naval patrol and establish full security for our oil and commercial fleet in that sea.â€ That statement was made as Bagheri oversaw the induction to service of two new Iranian warships, including the Makran . This vessel, which you can read more about here , is expected to serve as an Iranian expeditionary sea base and, forward-deployed to the Red Sea, could be of great value in supporting the Houthis. The 755-foot Makran could become a valuable asset in supporting the Iranian-backed militia operating in Yemen., IRANIAN STATE MEDIA Israel is also likely to be on heightened alert due to a potential response to its recent spate of attacks on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria. Here, amid the chaos of the civil war, Iran has been seeking to establish an increasingly robust permanent military presence, from where it can, in turn, support militant groups in the region, including providing advanced weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.Â IDF Spokesperson Zilberman said last month that Israel had used 500 smart missiles against targets in Syria over the past year. Just last week it was reported that Israel had carried out its heaviest raids on Syrian targets in recent years, the airstrikes on arms depots and military positions killing 57 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Among those said to be killed were Syrian regime forces and Iran-backed fighters. Tensions between Iran and the United States in the wider region have also been on the increase, with reports that Tehran fears an attack from the United States during the final days of the Trump Administration. In December, the U.S. Navy publicly announced the transit of USS Georgia , one of its four Ohio class guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, from the Gulf of Oman into the Persian Gulf by way of the highly strategic and often tense Strait of Hormuz . This was the first time one of these boats has sailed into that body of water in eight years. The rare appearance by an SSGN in the region would seem to be, at least in part, a signal aimed squarely at Iran and its regional proxies. It was followed up earlier this month by the appearance of a video reportedly showing an Iranian Navy Sea King helicopter flying over what was very likely the USS Georgia . USS Georgia passed through the Strait of Hormuz last December 21, accompanied by two Ticonderoga class cruisers, USS Port Royal and USS Philippine Sea . , U.S. Navy Against this backdrop, Iran also recently announced its plans to press ahead with enriching uranium at up to 20% purity, reducing the time it would take for the regime in Tehran to produce weapons-grade level material for use in a weapon, should it choose to do so. This is in clear violation of the controversial international deal that Iran made with the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, in 2015. In May 2018, Trump announced that the U.S government would pull out of that agreement and the U.S. government subsequently reimposed sanctions against Tehran. So far, we have yet to see any response from Iran â€” or any Iranian proxies â€” against Israel. But the deployment of additional air defense assets to Eilat shows that the IDF has been preparing for just such an eventuality. Should an attack come in the form of cruise missiles and/or suicide drones, a forward-deployed Iron Dome in the Red Sea, or even the Mediterranean, could provide a vital line of defense.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 2, 2021",The Story Of The Jet That Would Have Delivered South Africa’s Nuclear Bomb,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Africa, an international pariah for much of the Cold War due to its apartheid policy, remains the only country to have developed nuclear weapons and then voluntarily given them up. Before it did so, the main focus of these developments was an air-launched weapon that was intended to be delivered by a Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer strike aircraft. This combination could potentially have struck targets in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as part of South Africa’s long-running campaign against regional rebel groups, or even hostile revolutionary governments. With plenty of uranium available, South Africa had already become interested in nuclear energy as a source of electrical power by the early 1970s. It sought to enrich uranium for its own use and for export and, at the same time, the government began to examine the military potential of these developments. In the same period, the country was becoming increasingly entrenched in the Border War in what was then known as South West Africa, which remained under South African control until 1990, at which point it became the independent country of Namibia. As a sideshow to that conflict, the South African Defense Force (SADF) also became involved in fighting in Angola to the north, where it would meet well-equipped Cuban and other Soviet-backed forces. A South African Air Force Buccaneer S50 at Ysterplaat in 1970. At least one of these aircraft was modified to carry a nuclear weapon., Col André Kritzinger/Wikimedia Commons By 1974, the South African regime had decided to develop a nuclear weapon that could be used, if required, in these escalating conflicts. Not surprisingly, the efforts to build these weapons of mass destruction were conducted in strict secrecy, but after weapons inspectors were invited into the country in 1993, many more details started to become available. There remain still, however, some significant gaps in our knowledge, including the possible test of a South African nuclear device in 1979 — the so-called Vela incident — when a U.S. reconnaissance satellite detected a flash over the South Atlantic, suggestive of an atmospheric nuclear explosion. What is known is that by 1977, a single gun-type nuclear device — a fission-based weapon like the U.S. Little Boy bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II — was nearly ready to be tested, when the Soviet Union and the United States uncovered the plans. At this point, secrecy around the program increased further and it was switched from scientific to military control, led by the arms contractor Kentron, which had established a new facility for the purpose by 1980. Ultimately, South Africa succeeded in producing five complete nuclear devices that could have been deployed operationally, plus a test device. The first true operational weapon — initially codenamed Hobo and later Cabot — was a six-kiloton device made ready in 1982. One more device was left unfinished by 1989 when it was decided to suspend work on the program. These were all of the gun type, although in 1985, work was also launched on a more advanced uranium implosion device, similar in broad strokes to the U.S. Fat Man bomb also dropped on Japan during World War II, without producing any weapons. South Africa also began planning for how to deliver its warheads if the need arose. One option was to place the device on a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), based on the Israeli Jericho 2 missile. However, the device was always designed to be interchangeable for different delivery systems and was small enough to be accommodated in an air-launched glide bomb. It seems the preferred aircraft to carry this was the British-built Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer , originally developed as a naval strike aircraft that served aboard British aircraft carriers . The United Kingdom had transferred these aircraft to South Africa from 1965, despite having just introduced an arms embargo because of the country’s apartheid policy, one year earlier. The Raptor I glide bomb served as the basis for South Africa’s air-launched nuclear weapon., Denel Dynamics South Africa ordered 16 of the Buccaneer S50 version, a land-based strike variant tailored specifically for the country’s requirements, with the powered folding-wing system found on the British Royal Navy jets deleted and with additional provisions for flying in a ‘hot and high’ environment. These included a pair of retractable Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines in the rear fuselage to boost takeoff performance, although these were rarely used. A Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engine on display at the RAF Museum Cosford., Nimbus227/Wikipedia Commons To get around the embargo, the United Kingdom had agreed to deliver the Buccaneers on the understanding they would be used for purely defensive missions, such as protecting the shipping lanes around the Cape. In reality, not only would these aircraft see extensive combat in Angola, but they would also be earmarked to carry South Africa’s nuclear weapons. British authorities did subsequently cancel South African options to buy another 14 Buccaneers. SAAF Buccaneers lined up. , Uncredited Buccaneers in formation., SAAF After crew training in the United Kingdom, the South African Air Force (SAAF) Buccaneers were delivered between November 1965 and October 1966. Attrition was notably high, with one of the jets ditching in the sea on its delivery flight. By 1979, only six of the 16 Buccaneers reportedly remained in service. Ultimately, no fewer than 13 aircraft were involved in serious incidents during the type’s career, with 10 aircrews losing their lives. Over Angola, the SAAF Buccaneers were especially active from 1978, including flying bombing raids during that year’s Battle of Cassinga fought against the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO). SWAPO had been using bases in Angola to support its campaign for independence in what would later become Namibia. Other raids were flown against SWAPO training camps in Zambia, with the jets employing conventional bombs, unguided rockets, and French-made AS30 guided missiles, the latter of which had a range of up to 7.5 miles. The jets were also upgraded throughout their service, receiving a reconnaissance pod, threat warning receivers, and countermeasures dispensers. South African troops on patrol near the Angola border in the early 1980s., Smikect/Wikimedia Commons Adapting the indigenous nuclear weapon for air-launch by the Buccaneer was to involve a version of the locally developed H-2 television-guided glide bomb, subsequently also known as the Raptor I. The basic H-2 had a range of up to 37 miles and after its TV seeker had locked onto a target, control of the weapon could also be handed over to another aircraft within a radius of up to 125 miles, via a data-link pod. Opting for a glide bomb may also have had the advantage of reducing the need for nuclear delivery programming aboard the aircraft and providing the aircrew with a more straightforward mission profile, without the need for specific bomb delivery techniques. The Raptor I-based option had the benefit of being able to be launched from a Buccaneer outside the range of the Soviet-made, Cuban-operated air defense systems that were a serious threat to SAAF aircraft operating over Angola. The Buccaneer could also extend its range through aerial refueling, in conjunction with the SAAF’s Boeing 707 tankers, putting many more targets within reach. In a demonstration of the Buccaneer’s endurance, one of those jets had remained airborne for 9 hours and 5 minutes in December 1966, with the aid of two inflight refuelings. A South African Air Force 707 demonstrates aerial refueling with a pair of Cheetah fighter jets. , Col André Kritzinger/Wikimedia Commons The nuclear-tipped glide bomb based on the H-2 received the codename Hamerkop , after a bird native to parts of southern Africa, the appearance of which, according to myth, was a harbinger of death for the people below. This delivery system was more within the technical reach of South Africa than an MRBM and it appears that this view that the Hamerkop was more likely to be a success led to the complete termination of the development of such a missile. In a bizarre addendum to the latter, the prototype transporter developed for the MRBM, known as Moerse Lorrie Zonder Naam , or ‘huge lorry without a name’ was repurposed as a fire truck . The same design also served as the basis for an ammunition resupply vehicle for the G6 self-propelled howitzer . The switch from civilian to military leadership from 1977 had resulted in significant disruption for the South African nuclear weapons program, but there were other, technical, hitches, too. For example, no devices were produced between 1982 and 1986, partly due to concerns with the safety of an air-launched weapon. Tests had shown that a gun-type device, when dropped accidentally or jettisoned from the aircraft carrying it if it suffered a malfunction, could detonate due to the impact alone, without being electrically armed. A significant redesign was required during this period to prevent this from happening. As far as is known, only a single Buccaneer was ever modified for the carriage of the Hamerkop, probably between 1987 and 1989, coinciding with the period in which most of the usable weapons were completed. This aircraft is serial number 422, today preserved at the SAAF Museum in Swartkop, near Pretoria. While five Hamerkops were built (corresponding with the five functional nuclear devices), there is no record of any test flights or launches of unarmed weapons from Buccaneers or other aircraft. The weapon reportedly had a 20-kiloton yield. Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer S50 serial number 422 preserved in the SAAF Museum at Swartkop., NJR ZA/Wikimedia Commons The final death knell for South Africa’s nuclear weapons program was the presidency of F. W. de Klerk , who came to power in 1989, deciding to do away with it. There was apparently no significant opposition from the military, whose experience in years cross-border campaigns had not revealed any requirement for a weapon of this type. Ultimately, the actual utility of a nuclear weapon in the conflict in Angola was always negligible, and its use would represent an unprecedented escalation while further ostracizing the South African regime. Moreover, the end of apartheid now seemed to be in sight, and possession of weapons of mass destruction would do nothing to enhance South Africa’s international position then, or in the future. While a veil of secrecy remained over the program, de Klerk oversaw the removal of enriched uranium from the weapons that had been completed. In 1991, South Africa finally signed the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and, two years later, de Klerk acknowledged the existence of the nuclear weapons program. Survivors of the SAAF Buccaneer fleet were withdrawn in the same year, by which time only five examples were reportedly still airworthy. Some lingered on for some years longer in private hands, including providing flights to thrill-seekers with the Thunder City company in Cape Town. That was not the end of the line for the glide bomb, however. In 1998, the conventionally armed H-2 was declassified and began to be marketed as the Raptor I. Further development led to the improved Raptor II, which added different guidance options, and was exported to Algeria and Pakistan, followed by the MUlti-Purpose Stand-Off Weapon (MUPSOW), a jet-powered cruise missile. The Raptor II glide bomb, derived from the H-2., Denel Dynamics South Africa may also have assisted Pakistan in developing its own Ra’ad cruise missile — also nuclear-armed. As Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, founding publisher of Arms Control Wonk.com and an expert on missiles and nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey points out, it is also conceivable that South Africa may have only worked on a conventional version of the Ra’ad. Either way, if true, it brings the story of South Africa’s quest to build an air-launched nuclear weapon full circle. Today, very little of the hardware related to the South African nuclear weapons program remains, although Buccaneer 442 at Swartkop stands testament to what might have been, but thankfully wasn’t.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2021",Listen To What The Capitol’s ‘Giant Voice’ Alert System Sounds Like When It Goes Into Lockdown,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Downtown Washington, D.C. has been turned into a veritable fortress in the wake of the storming of the Capitol building and ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration this week, as you can read about more in this War Zone piece from yesterday. Tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel, as well as law enforcement officers, are in place and on high alert. We have now gotten a demonstration of the take-absolutely-no-chances security posture in place in the city after a nearby fire triggered a brief lockdown at the Capitol, complete with loudspeakers blaring a message directing people to shelter in place or otherwise seek cover due to an “external security threat.” The fire in question broke out around 10:00 AM local time near the intersection of 1st and F Streets, Southeast, just over 3,000 feet southeast of the Capitol. The exact cause remains unknown, but the blaze appears to have started at a homeless encampment. D.C. Fire and EMS have already reported that the fire has been extinguished and that there were thankfully no injuries. The U.S. Secret Service says that “there is no threat to the public.” A picture of the fire in Washington, D.C. that triggered a lockdown at the Capitol on Jan. 18, 2021., via Twitter Capitol Police subsequently said the fire was ignited by two small propane tanks or similar containers exploding. One person was taken into custody, but it’s unclear what the charges might be. However, the fire broke out during a rehearsal for the inauguration, and in the aftermath of the siege on the Capitol on Jan. 6 and subsequent alerts about potential new security threats in the nation’s capital, it’s clear that no one is taking any chances. Soon after the fire started and smoke started to rise to the west of the Capitol, the building went on lockdown, alarms went off, and a very powerful loudspeaker system began broadcasting a message about an “external security threat” and advising people inside the building to shelter in place and avoid doors and windows, as well as instructing people outside to seek cover. People outside were seen moving quickly away from the complex. Listen to the loudspeaker siren and message in the video below. It is also linked here if it does not show up. We don’t know the exact loudspeaker system installed at the Capitol, but it seems extremely similar to the “ Giant Voice ” systems that the U.S. military employs to issue similar alerts at bases at home and abroad. These kinds of systems are modern air raid sirens , with the added ability to play pre-recorded and live messages with high clarity over a massive area. The video below shows the test of a Giant Voice system at the U.S. Army’s Fort Benning in Georgia last year. In a public news release about nearby Andrews AFB’s Giant Voice system, its capabilities were described as such: “There isn’t one person who is the Giant Voice,” explained Tech. Sgt. Joseph Brady, NCO in charge of console operations for the Andrews Regional Command Post and 316th Wing Command Post. “In fact, the 113th Wing (D.C. Air National Guard) uses the system as well.” While a few base residents may view the Giant Voice as a nuisance, Sergeant Brady said the system should be viewed as a tool. The command post, the primary command and control node for both the Air Force National Capital Region and the president’s base, uses the Giant Voice for mass alert, should the base come under threat of attack or natural disaster. Command post controllers provide situational awareness to the important NCR power projection platform that is Andrews. “One of the biggest misconceptions about the system is that you can adjust the volume – you can’t. A large part of the variation in volume comes from wind direction which impacts the overall sound you hear coming over the Giant Voice – we don’t control that,” Sergeant Brady explained. A radio frequency is sent base wide to the Giant Voice speakers strategically placed around the base, which is part of the reason why an echo may be heard when the national anthem is played. In the case of war, base residents will hear three to five-minute wavering tones, like what is heard in the old-time war movies with a high pitch that then drops to a lower tone and back. During peacetime, but under threat of severe weather, a mass notification is made to take shelter with a steady tone. Because the surrounding community immediately outside the gates can hear the Giant Voice, as well, lightning warnings are not sounded at Andrews as not to alarm non-military personnel. “The warning system was working almost too well in that case,” said Sergeant Brady. “The decision was made to only sound the Giant Voice if there was severe weather – like a tornado or hurricane – or if the base is under attack. The bottom line is, if you hear the Giant Voice and you do not hear ‘This is a test’ or ‘Exercise, exercise, exercise,’ you need to get indoors or take shelter immediately.” Staff on Capitol Hill also got a text message alert from the Capitol Police with a similar message to the one issued via the speakers. This again is akin to how the U.S. military issues alerts about various kinds of threats, even including potential incoming missiles . “In an abundance of caution following an external security threat under the bridge on I-295 at First and F Streets, SE, Acting Chief Pittman ordered a shutdown of the Capitol Complex,” the Capitol Police subsequently said in a statement issued to the media. “There are currently no fires on or within the Capitol campus.” This was further confirmed by the U.S. Secret Service in its statement after the incident was declared over and the lockdown was lifted. Needless to say, given the current circumstances, together with the images of smoke, people running from the Capitol lawn, and the blaring sirens did raise initial concerns that something serious was going on. Thankfully, that turned out to not be the case in this instance. At the same time, we now know very well what it will sound like if the Capitol has to go into another emergency lockdown this week due to any other potential security threats. We will update this story as more information becomes available. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 20, 2021","25,000 Guardsmen Are In The Capital, Five Times The Troops In Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq Combined","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. America sits on the precipice of a presidential inauguration the likes of which we have never seen in our lifetime. A deeply divided nation is still coming to terms with the events on Capitol Hill on January 6, when pro-Trump protestors stormed the Capitol, chanted about hanging Vice President Mike Pence, assailed police, and ran wild through the halls of America’s seat of representative democracy. In reaction to those events and as the result of an avalanche of troubling intelligence , the center of the nation’s capital has become a locked-down fortress with thousands of law enforcement officers from an array of federal and local agencies backstopped by an unprecedented deployment of National Guardsmen to the Capital Region—set to eclipse 25,000 troops in total. That is roughly five times the amount of troops now in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq combined . This 25,000 figure is in addition to active forces that are also taking part in security for the inauguration, which also number in the thousands. For comparison, 8,000 Guardsmen took part in Trump’s inauguration in 2016. These forces are streaming in from all over the United States and beyond. There has been a steady flow of military transport aircraft arriving in the capital region to drop off these forces and their equipment. Meanwhile, large numbers of troops are not the only manifestation of extreme security for the inauguration. Fortified fencing has been erected around the vast majority of The Mall area and beyond, pushing security far out from major landmarks—most notably the Capitol and the White House—as Washington, D.C. slides into a state of quasi-lockdown. AP While past inaugurations have been showcases in extreme security in their own right—you can read all about the last one in this past feature of ours —they have never been anything like this. And while the current security affair in the Capitol is militarily impressive, it is a very sad and troubling indication of the current state of the union. What comes next is anyone’s guess. As of now, President-elect Biden is still planning on taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol, while his staff is also preparing for a number of contingencies. Regardless of reports of intelligence that points to large-scale violent acts in Washington on the inauguration day, one has to wonder how realistic this actually is at this point? Of course, small groups of nefarious actors can have a big impact, but any large groups lack proximity to the main event and are ridiculously outmatched by tens of thousands of armed soldiers and law enforcement that have been put on the highest alert. One would imagine that asymmetric threats, which are less impacted by these blunt security measures, still remain a grave security concern. Even the possibility of an attack from within the ranks of the military itself is now a concern that is being dealt with . The reality is that chatter is just that, chatter. It has to be taken seriously, but talking about doing something and actually doing it are two different things, especially in terms of a large organized group. The loss of social media that can be used to easily coordinate planning for groups that are considered a threat is another roadblock to realizing any sort of operation of this scale. Although, that is a double-edged sword. The tradeoff between denying bad actors access to readily accessible digital communications, most notably social media, may blunt their capabilities in the near term, and to a degree in the long term, as well, but the intelligence community loses the ability to easily peer into these same groups with ease. This makes predicting future actions and even exploitable fissures within extremist elements much harder to do. These tradeoffs have been well established—the hard way—during the Global War On Terrorism. With all this in mind, the threat of smaller groups acting around the U.S. seems to have risen possibly higher than any sort of major action occurring in Washington, and this situation is likely to exist for months, if not years to come. Another question that is outstanding is what reverberations will the siege on the Capitol have on the average citizen’s access to major federal facilities, especially those that are major tourist attractions, in the future. How long will the fencing remain? One has to question whether things will it ever really return to how it was on January 5th, which already reflected a significantly increased security posture compared to how things were on September 10th, 2001. How hard will it be to take your family to the Capitol and to learn about its history and utility hands-on in the months and years to come? A government removed from its constituents only deepens alienation among the electorate, but balancing this against the safety of the facility and its inhabitants will be a tough proposition going forward. Then there is the question of how this actually was able to happen in the first place. The idea that the Capitol wasn’t more fortified and there were not quick reaction teams on standby for such an event is beyond puzzling and has been a major question of security analysts, the media, and lawmakers alike since January 6th. Just the reality that there weren’t any roll-down metal gates retrofitted in the Capitol to slow an advance of a threat is mind-boggling, not to mention other passive and active measures that help do the same. Then there was the fact that those tasked with protecting lawmakers in session during such a demonstration, or at all for that matter, were equipped with mere handguns to defend the chambers—not a long gun in sight. It’s almost impossible to fathom that after so many billions have been spent on massively enhancing the security apparatus in Washington, both above and below ground , over the last 20 years, that such an incident could take place seemingly so easily. Just imagine if there were large armed contingents in that mob or individuals with a penitent for fire-starting, or if a trained smaller force tried to make a move on the Capitol during a far lower security time frame? The fact of the matter is we got very lucky. If there were elements within the mob that were heavily armed and had planned on executing a mass casualty event, similar to the Mumbai attacks, the result would have been almost unimaginably worse. Still, that is little consolation for the family of deceased Officer Brian Sicknick who was killed in the ordeal, or to those who were badly wounded. While there have already been resignations or firings of the security commanders involved, including the Chief of the Capitol Police and the House and Senate’s Sergeants at Arms , this is only the beginning. Many are calling for a 9/11 Report-like inquiry regarding the siege and the failings found in such a postmortem will be extensive and damning. The War Zone has talked to more security experts than we can count over the last week, all of which were astonished as to how many balls seemed to have been dropped at such a critical time and how naive and unimaginative the planning was for this event, or seemingly any attack on the Capitol was. This squares with the realization now that intelligence products were being circulated from the most prestigious sources , including those by the same Capitol Police that was in charge of protecting the Capitol, that such an event was not just possible, but even probable, in the days leading up to January 6th. This shouldn’t have been any huge surprise to anyone who has watched the political environment over the last four years, and especially the events following the most recent election. All this has also led to accusations that some lawmakers even helped those who took part in the Capitol raid. These accusations are likely to be adjudicated when Congress executes the aforementioned after-action report piecing together what did and did not actually happen during the crisis. Meanwhile, the FBI is aggressively pursuing those who took part in the siege, with hundreds of cases now open and more likely to come. Obviously, this will lead to new intelligence as to what exactly people in that crowd knew and didn’t know and what help any of them were offered by those in power, whether legislators or the police, if any at all. Although it is easy for the press to talk in monolithic terms, the reality of an event like this is that there were likely a massive range of groups and individuals all with different objectives and motives for storming the Capitol, from being caught up in the moment and following a large group, to well trained and premeditated teams of attackers. It will be interesting to see how the judicial system deals with this reality. Now the prevailing fear is that all this was a prelude to what is to come on Wednesday. We can only hope that is not the case. What happened on January 6th wasn’t just an attack on American democracy and our collective symbols of our republic, but also the biggest gift one can imagine to our adversaries, namely Russia and China, who have longed only dreamed of such an event and the footage that came with it. Now they have January 6th to hold up as an example for years to come for propaganda and informational warfare purposes. It plays directly into their grand goals of reducing America’s claims on stability and exceptionalism through democracy. Regardless, it is hard to imagine that things will return to normal, if there really is a normal anymore, anytime soon. With the threat that manifested itself on June 6th now distributed and fractured all over the country, things will likely be tense for the foreseeable future, especially around State Capitals and other local centers of political gravitas. We can only hope that the powers that be will work to come to terms with the political and social issues our country is confronted with and learn to govern in a way that is far more inclusive than exclusive. The turning of politics into a WWE-like all or nothing farce has only added to all this. That in itself has become a big business. Only compromise and bipartisanship will go a long way in turning that around. In the end, we should be Americans first, not party members or subscribers of one idealogy or another. But having lawmakers portray that to constituents and look beyond special interests and strict party lines for short-term political gains will take far more discipline than what we have seen in recent years. We can only hope that cooler heads will prevail and somehow we can take this tragedy as a turning point to lower the partisan rhetoric and focus on what unites us, not just what divides us. We will be covering the security situation in Washington D.C., all week. Please stay tuned for our ongoing coverage.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 28, 2020",Iran’s Missiles Landing Within 100 Miles Of A U.S. Carrier Is Provocative But Not Much Else,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s testing of a variety of medium-range ballistic missiles yesterday has caused a lot of misplaced fear and misunderstanding. The launch , which was part of the country’s “first phase” of its Great Prophet 15 exercise, was not a surprise and saw ballistic missiles traveling over 1,000 miles into the Indian Ocean in a claimed anti-ship ballistic missile test. The missiles splashed down 100 miles from the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group that has been operating in the region and 20 miles from another unidentified ship. Iran claims it destroyed a floating target in the tests, although this has not been confirmed in any way. Still, the headlines and reported claims were ominous, indicating that there was some threat to the American armada. That simply was not the case. The test appears to have been at least partially another ruse by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to make its capabilities look more robust than they actually are and to supply fresh propaganda for both domestic and international consumption. AP While the sea is a very big place and 100 miles is not a grand distance, relatively speaking, Iran’s missile test doesn’t prove these missiles pose a threat to the Nimitz or any other ship for that matter. The exact location of a carrier strike group can be obtained in many ways. If you are an individual or country, you can often track them via low-resolution commercial satellite imagery. This doesn’t offer precise targeting capabilities in any way and only provides delayed, general positioning information, with the possible location of the ships in question growing in a circle with every passing moment. In other words, a six-hour old image of a carrier strike group that can travel at a maximum of around 30 knots offers a maximum ring of uncertainty measuring roughly 180 nautical miles in any direction, although the heading the ships are traveling in the image can help a bit with some predictability. In reality, normal operating speeds are about half that or so, so for ease of the math, let’s call the actual distance of uncertainty to be 90 nautical miles. The more recent the image, the smaller the probability of error. It’s just simple math.

And THREE (3) solid propelled Sejjils. pic.twitter.com/Tn2fPDO9SY — Tal Inbar (@inbarspace) January 16, 2021 If you are the government of a country, such as Iran, you have many more tools at your disposal, including a vast intelligence-gathering apparatus that includes human and electronic intelligence sources, as well as cyber capabilities that can help pinpoint a vessel’s whereabouts. On a military level, you also have long-range maritime patrol aircraft with radar and electronic support measures that can search for a carrier strike group over vast distances via active and passive detection methods. This is in addition to your own naval assets, both declared and undeclared, that operate continuously throughout the region and can relay coordinates of vessels of interest. For a U.S. carrier strike group, Iran likely has multiple vessels working to keep track of it at any given time. As such, getting regular fixes on a carrier strike group in your own general region is not some high-end task, especially during peacetime when a whole slew of measures are not put in place to help limit detection. Everything gets far more complicated and deadly when the strike group is actively defending itself. So, just because some ballistics missile fell within 100 miles of the Nimitz , that does not mean the Iranians have the ability to actually engage a carrier directly with their ballistic missiles. In order to do that with a high degree of reliability, the missile should be capable of receiving midcourse updates via third party targeting platforms, such as ships, aircraft, or satellites. Then, they actually have to be able to find, lock, and track a maneuvering target on their own during their terminal phase of flight. This is no easy task considering the speed at which they are traveling and the atmospheric effects on the maneuvering warhead itself. Simply put, it is a far more complex kill chain than most realize. Still, to the average person reading a headline about ballistic missiles falling within a hundred miles of an American supercarrier, it may seem that way. Iranian ballistic missiles ready to fire during the Great Prophet 15 exercise., AP Even hitting a floating static target far out to sea is a different reality than one that is moving and maneuvering. Iran is mass-producing maneuvering warheads and has used them in anger to great effect . But being able to hit a precise fixed target on the ground or maneuvering during flight as a countermeasure to anti-ballistic missile systems, is not the same as targeting and successfully engaging a moving target a thousand miles out at sea. The missiles would also require their own onboard targeting sensors that are capable of working under the extreme terminal phase of flight conditions and the related guidance package and software needed to leverage those sensors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=3NxAvmBTiqQ Iran has claimed that it has anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities before, but for shorter-range ballistic missiles that are more adept at engaging targets in the Persian Gulf and northern stretch of the Arabian Sea, with the support of throngs of targeting sensors and other capabilities that are in place there, as compared to a target sailing 1,000 miles out into the open ocean. All that being said, it is only a matter of time until Iran does develop this capability, which may have been what this test was at least partially about. They have watched how China’s anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities have changed the calculus for U.S. Navy operations in the Pacific Theater, at least during wartime, and have come to underpin Beijing’s anti-access, area denial strategy . There is no evidence that this day has come, or is even all that near, for Iran. The exact capabilities of China’s own long-range ASBM capabilities are only emerging now , after years of development and missile production. In addition, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s Aegis-equipped escorts have the ability to shoot these and even more capable ballistic missiles down , although just how robust that capability is, which is now multi-layer in nature, remains to be seen. Reports state that half a dozen missiles were fired as part of the high-profile test event., AP So, in the end, Iran got a two for one here. They got a high-profile test of their medium-range ballistic missiles that flew their complete down-range profile. This will provide good data on how to improve these weapons in the future. At the same time, they made it look like they can threaten a U.S. Carrier Strike Group 1,000 miles from Iranian shores with this capability, which they cannot. Of course, they did this at a time of extreme tensions and saber-rattling with the United States, so added value there. Above all else, this is another reminder of how Iran remains a capable asymmetric warfare opponent, both on the traditional battlefield and on the information battlefield.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 6, 2020",General Atomics’ Stealthy Avenger Drone Flies With Infrared Search And Track Pod,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has conducted a flight test involving one of its stealthy Avenger unmanned aircraft carrying a Lockheed Martin Legion Pod under its wing. The Legion Pod is fitted with an infrared search and track sensor , or IRST, designed to detect and track other aircraft at extended ranges, but can also be configured to carry various other sensors and systems. This combination could quickly give Avengers an array of new capabilities for use when acting as a “ loyal wingman ” together with manned aircraft or flying autonomously, alone or together with other unmanned platforms . General Atomics’ Aeronautical Systems division, or GS-ASI, announced the flight test on Jan. 15, 2021, but did not say specifically where or when it occurred. The flight lasted 90 minutes and was a captive carry test intended to make sure the Avenger could safely carry the pod on the underwing pylon. GA-ASI said that it had taken less than three months working in cooperation with Lockheed Martin “to move from concept to flight.” A General Atomics Avenger drone carrying a Lockheed Martin Legion Pod during a flight test., GA-ASI “Our flight demonstration revealed the quick reaction capabilities of the Avenger RPA [remotely piloted aircraft],” GA-ASI Vice President of Strategic Development J.R. Reid said in a press release. “From software and hardware architecture implementation to sensor integration, the Avenger is a great platform for delivering critical capabilities.” “The successful integration of Legion Pod on the Avenger RPA is a testament to the flexibility of the Legion Pod system from a fighter aircraft to an unmanned aircraft, which means Legion Pod has proven its capabilities can assist our warfighter and keep them ahead of threats,” Kenen Nelson, director of Fixed Wing Sensor Programs at Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control, said in the same statement. “We are excited to see how our IRST21 systems will be integrated on other unmanned platforms.” It’s also not clear if integrating the Legion Pod onto the Avenger has been an independent initiative on the part of the two companies or if this is in response to specific requirements from a particular customer. On Jan. 6, GA-ASI had also announced that the Air Force had hired it to modify two Avengers as surrogates for the Skyborg program . This pair of drones are set to receive “upgraded datalinks and the core Skyborg System Design Agent (SDA) software, as well as other payloads,” as part of that project, according to General Atomics. “These Avengers will then be used as part of various experimentation events in 2021 and 2022, which will enable manned aircraft to control Avengers while in flight and relay specific information between the manned and unmanned aircraft,” a press release at the time added. The Air Force Research Laboratory is leading the Skyborg project, which is seeking to develop a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems that will be able to control “loyal wingman” type drones, as well as potentially fully-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). You can read more about the Skyborg program and its goals in this past War Zone piece . In December 2020, GA-ASI, as well as Boeing and Kratos, had received a separate contract to develop new prototype loyal wingman drones to carry the Skyborg systems. More than a dozen companies, in total, are supplying various other components for the project. A video presentation, seen below, on Skyborg that Air Force released last year included a notional drone design that appeared to have an IRST sensor in its nose. Also in December 2020, the company announced it had conducted a test flight involving an Avenger carrying a software package originally developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and that is now maintained by the U.S. Navy. That test saw the drone fly semi-autonomously in coordination with five other simulated Avengers to conduct a mock air-to-air mission in which they searched for aerial threats. The Avenger, which has an internal weapons bay that could potentially be configured to fire air-to-air weapons, would be particularly well suited to that kind of mission when also equipped with the Legion Pod. With data links installed in the pod, it could potentially push information about any potential threats it detects straight to other manned or unmanned aircraft. The IRST21 sensor is capable of providing actual targeting information, which could also be transmitted to those offboard platforms. Multiple IRST21 carrying aircraft could improve that targeting through triangulation, a perfect job for loyal wingmen and autonomous drones. Unlike radars, IRST sensors work passively, meaning hostile aircraft being tracked may not even know they’ve been detected. They similarly do not give away the presence and potential location of the aircraft carrying them. Beyond that, they provide a valuable alternative to radar when attempting to spot aerial threats in environments where there is heavy electronic warfare jamming and are unaffected by radar-evading features on stealthy aircraft or missiles. As already noted, the Legion Pod is also designed to modular and has an open-architecture design intended to allow for the rapid integration of new payloads and functionality in the future. You can read more about this pod, in general, in this past War Zone piece . A Lockheed Martin infographic describing the basic capabilities of the Legion Pod., Lockheed Martin All told, the addition of the Legion Pod on the Avenger could open very exciting new doors for that particular unmanned aircraft and for the Legion Pod itself. It also offers new insight into the kind of capabilities that the Air Force might be looking as part of the Skyborg program. Just the idea of stealthy, networked drones carrying IRSTs represents a palpable threat to the world’s most advanced and stealthy enemy aircraft.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Oct 21, 2021",White House Accelerates Development Of Mini Nuclear Reactors For Space And The Battlefield,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Trump issued an Executive Order on January 12 that aims to promote small, modular nuclear reactors for defense and space exploration applications. According to a press statement issued by the White House, the order will “further revitalize the United States nuclear energy sector, reinvigorate America’s space exploration program, and produce diverse energy options for national defense needs.” The order instructs NASA’s administrator to prepare a report within 180 days that will define NASA’s requirements and foreseeable issues for developing a nuclear energy system for human and robotic exploratory missions through 2040. The order also calls for a “Common Technology Roadmap” between NASA and the Departments of Energy, Defense, Commerce, and State for implementing new reactor technologies. The full text of the Executive Order can be read at WhiteHouse.gov. An artist’s conception of NASA’s 2018 Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY) experiments, which examined approaches to designing nuclear reactors for space exploration., NASA The statement cites American progress in mobile nuclear reactors, the likes of which have generated power aboard submarines and aircraft carriers for nearly seven decades. As competition in space heats up and becomes a more central part of America’s military strategy, the White House is now looking to apply that same level of energy innovation to the stars. “Using small modular reactors for national defense and space exploration will allow the United States to maintain and advance our leadership and dominance across space and terrestrial domains,” the statement claims. More specifically, the press release states that this Executive Order aims to outline the potential uses the DoD sees for mobile reactors for terrestrial applications, while also pointing to upcoming missions to the Moon and Mars as primary aims for developing new compact reactors for space: Small modular reactors have the potential to enhance energy flexibility and energy security at domestic military installations in remote locations.  At President Trump’s direction, the Department of Defense will establish and implement a plan to demonstrate the energy flexibility and cost-effectiveness of a small modular reactor at a domestic military installation, and will pilot a transportable small modular reactor for a mission other than naval propulsion for the first time in half a century. Nuclear power sources are essential to deep space exploration, where solar power is not practical. The sustainable exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other locations will be enhanced by small modular reactors deployed from Earth for operations across the solar system. NASA will explore the use of nuclear energy systems for human and robotic exploration missions through 2040. As the United States develops new technology, we will continue to adhere to the highest standards for nuclear nonproliferation and safety. According to SpaceNews.com , the order also directs the Department of Energy to transition its High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) project to the commercial sector for further development. That project aims to develop uranium fuels with higher levels of enrichment, allowing for longer-lasting reactor designs with increased fuel efficiencies. Currently, there is no domestic commercial enrichment capability for producing HALEU, and thus the order pushes for new steps towards producing this nuclear fuel. NASA and the National Nuclear Security Administration test a reactor known as the Kilowatt Reactor Using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY system). Like the reactors outlined in the current Executive Order, KRUSTY is aimed at deep space exploration., Los Alamos National Laboratory/NASA Creating these mobile, high-powered energy solutions has been a priority for the DoD for some time . In 2016, the DoD’s Defense Science Board (DSB) created the ad hoc Task Force on Energy Systems for Forward/Remote Operating Bases, which issued a report to provide advice to the Secretary of Defense regarding mobile reactors. The task force examined various methods of providing energy to these austere locales, addressing factors such as costs, technical feasibility, safety and security issues, and logistical concerns. The task force ultimately concluded that the U.S. military “could become the beneficiaries of reliable, abundant, and continuous energy through the deployment of nuclear energy power systems” in the form of very small modular nuclear reactors (vSMRs). While the report cited several obstacles and issues blocking the path to deploying such systems, the report did “not consider any as ‘show-stoppers’ to pursue engineering development and prototyping of vSMR capabilities.” In 2018, the U.S. Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics stated the service wanted its brigades to be able to operate in forward-deployed scenarios for a week without resupply . The incredibly energy-hungry modern military depends on increasingly sophisticated ground-based sensors, artillery and air defense systems , communications networks , electronic warfare systems , and temporary living spaces and mess halls, all of which consume large amounts of power. Directed energy weapons will only make this situation more pressing in the future. A mobile nuclear reactor that could fit aboard existing cargo aircraft could be a game-changer in terms of how long brigades could operate independently without resupply. Just last year, the Pentagon issued two new contracts for mobile reactors that will eventually transition to the Army. A Department of Defense image outlining how compact reactors may one day be deployed., DOD In 2019, U.S. military’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) requested proposals from potential contractors to develop “innovative technologies and approaches” for “ small mobile nuclear power reactors .” The SCO is calling that initiative “Project Dilithium” and hopes to have a reactor that can generate up to ten megawatts of energy while fitting in a semi-trailer or inside a C-17A Globemaster III. Section 4 of the Executive Order goes into further detail about the DoD’s energy needs, and outlines the role the Department of Defense will play in this new initiative to develop mobile nuclear reactors: Sec. 4.  Defense Capabilities.  (a)  The Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the world, using more than 10 million gallons of fuel per day and 30,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year, nearly all of which is provided through civilian electrical grids. Fuel demands for a modern United States military have dramatically grown since World War II and are anticipated to continue to increase in order to support high-energy-usage military systems.  In this context, nuclear power could significantly enhance national defense power capabilities. (b)  The Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA Administrator): (i)    determine whether advanced nuclear reactors can be made to benefit Department of Defense future space power needs; (ii)   pilot a transportable micro-reactor prototype; (iii)  direct an analysis of alternatives for personnel, regulatory, and technical requirements to inform future decisions with respect to nuclear power usage; and (iv)   direct an analysis of United States military uses for space nuclear power and propulsion technologies and an analysis of foreign adversaries’ space power and propulsion programs. These reactors could also power military bases stateside and provide power to areas impacted by natural disasters. The Executive Order also outlines a Common Technology Roadmap that “describes potential development programs and that coordinates, to the extent practicable, terrestrial-based advanced nuclear reactor and space-based nuclear power and propulsion efforts” between the Departments of Energy, Defense, Commerce, State, and NASA. This roadmap will also require “assessments of foreign nations’ space nuclear power and propulsion technological capabilities.” Naturally, one of the most pressing concerns with any nuclear technology is national security, and thus the order also instructs the DoD to work together with NASA and other agencies to identify security issues associated with any potential space-based nuclear systems. The Army Nuclear Power Program (ANPP), established in 1954, sought to develop reactors for use at remote sites. One of the reactors to stem from that program, PM-2A, was deployed at Camp Century in Greenland and is hailed as the first “portable” nuclear reactor., Public Domain With this new Executive Order, the White House seeks to propel the United States to the forefront of all of the work being conducted in compact reactor research. While the wording in the statement focuses more on space exploration, the Department of Defense’s involvement is highly important. Since space environments are similar in that resupply is a tricky, if not impossible, endeavor, NASA could help jump-start the DoD’s mobile nuclear program even further if both are really working on it collaboratively, although the requirements will be somewhat different. “There’s sometimes a risk of forcing too much commonality,” a White House official told SpaceNews.com . “What this executive order does is ensure that there is a deliberate look at what those opportunities may be.” If realized, the Executive Order’s accompanying statement reads, this initiative could lead to a “transportable small modular reactor for a mission other than naval propulsion for the first time in half a century.” Contact the author: Brett@TheDrive.com Brett Tingley Armies Land Nuclear Nuclear Power Space U.S. Army U.S. Space Force"

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 15, 2021",Those Mysterious Dark Helicopters Were Landing On Multiple Downtown LA Rooftops Last Night (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A trio of mysterious gray Bell 407 helicopters equipped with unique antennas, which may belong to an especially secretive U.S. military aviation unit, was up in the skies again over greater Los Angeles yesterday. You can read more about what we’ve been able to determine about them so far in our initial reporting here . During their most recent flights, two of them landed multiple times on rooftops in downtown L.A. This is very reminiscent of realistic urban training exercises that the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment has conducted in the same general area in the past , among other locations across the United States. All three of the helicopters – which have the serial numbers 12-1141, 12-1142, and 12-1143 painted on their tail booms – left Bob Hope Airport, also known as Hollywood Burbank Airport or KBUR, just north of Los Angeles, at around 6:00 PM local time on Jan. 14, according to online flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange . The helicopters had first arrived at that airport on Jan. 12 and have made multiple flights around the area since then. A picture of one of the mysterious Bell 407 helicopters, with the serial number 12-1141 on its tail boom, seen flying over the greater Los Angeles area on Jan. 13., Scott Lowe 12-1141 and 12-1142 subsequently flew routes that took them south to Long Beach, then down the coast to Laguna Beach, and eventually back to downtown L.A. via Anaheim. 12-1143 appears to have made it to Long Beach before turning straight back for Burbank for unclear reasons. These flights generally followed major freeways and occurred at altitudes below 1,000 feet. 12-1141’s route across the greater Los Angeles area on Jan. 14. , ADS-B Exchange The route that 12-1142 took to and from Burbank., ADS-B Exchange 12-1143’s truncated route., ADS-B Exchange After arriving over the center of L.A., 12-1141 and 12-1142 flew numerous orbits and touched down briefly on a number of rooftop helipads. Both helicopters visited the tops of the James K. Hahn City Hall East building and Two California Plaza , while 12-1142 also stopped on the roof of One California Plaza .

One California Plaza is the building with the helipad marked “10,” while two California Plaza has the helipad marked “12.”, Google Earth There was also flying activity nearby at Dodger Stadium and elsewhere in the Downtown Los Angeles area where the helicopters were or had been, by aircraft that whose IDs were not showing up. It is unclear if these were the same helicopters or other aircraft, although, in the past, additional overwatch assets have also taken part in these exercises. So, it wouldn’t be surprising if other assets were involved. ADS-B Exchange Interestingly, the available flight tracking data indicates that 12-1142 flew the entire route, including going all the way down to Laguna Beach, flew around downtown, and headed back to Burbank, twice. It finally returned to KBUR hours after the other two helicopters had touched down at that airport. What 12-1141 and 12-1142 were doing in downtown L.A. yesterday looks extremely similar to previous urban training that elements of the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) have conducted in the city in recent years . As seen in the videos below, the 160th has carried out these kinds of exercises in other cities across the country over the years, as well. Other U.S. military aviation units , as well as top-tier federal law enforcement units, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), do the same. Conventional military units and state and local law enforcement entities are often also involved. The prospect of fighting in a dense, urban environment has only increased in the past few decades. The U.S. military, as a whole, is acutely aware of the various challenges Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) pose compared to conflicts in more stereotypical locales, like deserts or open plains. The number of dedicated MOUT training facilities has steadily increased , as has the scope of what kind of simulated environments they provide. There is no substitute for the real thing, though, especially for aviation units. A “live” urban area, especially one as big and bustling as the greater Los Angeles area, is full of real-life potential hazards and bystanders, from power lines to other helicopters, which need to be navigated around. Atmospheric conditions, including the bright lights of the city, can impact what pilots see through their night vision goggles, as well. Buildings like James K. Hahn City Hall East and the towers at California Plaza provide a valuable break from routine training involving landing and taking off from and otherwise flying around better-known structures, no matter how realistic they might be, at established training facilities. Unfortunately, these exercises, which sometimes include machine guns firing blank rounds, have often occurred with little forewarning for the general public, subsequently prompting great concern among average citizens down below who have no idea what’s going on. With that in mind, these gray Bell 407s could certainly provide a more discreet platform for pilots from various aviation units, especially the 160th, to carry out this kind of training. At the same time, the possibility remains that these could belong to a more secretive U.S. government entity. As The War Zone explored in detail in its initial coverage of this trio of helicopters, Bell 407s are associated with the Army’s secretive Aviation Technology Office (ATO), previously known as the Flight Concepts Division. Other available information has also pointed to a connection between these particular helicopters and Felker Army Airfield at Fort Eustis in Virginia, where ATO/FCD is based. The unit could be getting similar training as their closely-tied 160th SOAR brethren or testing out a new piece of equipment in realistic conditions using the Bell 407s as a surrogate. You can read more about this unit, which provides clandestine aviation support to special operations units, is integrated very tightly with the 160th SOAR, and has close ties to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), while also being responsible for leading the development of what’s next in Army aviation, here and here . There’s also the potential that the 160th may have acquired some number of Bell 407s, or that these could belong to another U.S. government agency. FBI’s HRT flies 407s, as does the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), but in different configurations from these three helicopters. Though the 160th, in particular, has long operated AH-6s and MH-6s, variants of the MD 500-series , also commonly known as Little Birds , as its preferred light helicopters , due to their small size and overall performance characteristics. ATO/FCD also has its own long history flying Little Birds , but there have indications that they gave them up in recent years for other light helicopter types, including the Bell 407. The latest version of the Bell 407 offers competitive, if not superior capabilities to the Little Bird in a package that can still land in and take off from many relatively constrained spaces. Franz, a commercial fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter pilot with experience flying the Bell 407, and a good friend of The War Zone , explained it to us this way: I’ve spent a lot of time flying the Bell 407 conducting power line inspections in the urban environment. The 407 really is a pilot’s machine, it’s very maneuverable and relatively fast for a helicopter. Typically cruising between 120-130 knots, It can handle heavier payloads with around 2.5 hours of endurance on a full tank of fuel. The biggest concern we had with hovering at low altitude in the urban environment was the rotor downwash. The helicopter is capable of putting out hurricane-force winds that can easily wreak havoc on things not secured to the ground. The 407 is just over 10 feet longer than an MD500 allowing for landing in smaller LZs [landing zones] than a Huey or Blackhawk . The latest generation of the 407 has an even more powerful Allison turbine engine allowing for heavier payloads. The standard interior configuration allows for up to 6 passengers and a pilot. Overall, I would equate the 407 to the sports car of the civilian Bell product line. In the meantime, while we still don’t know with absolute certainty who is flying these helicopters in the skies about the greater Los Angeles area, The War Zone has received some new information since our first story broke. A reader in Lake Havasu in Arizona sent us videos of the three helicopters at the airport there on Jan. 11. This is a stopover we had already identified using existing flight tracking data, which also indicated that the trio had traveled all the way across the country before reaching Burbank. One of the videos shows the helicopters performing a very military-like maneuver in which they line up in formation on the runway before departing together in unison. The video below shows 160th SOAR MH-6s landing in a similar formation during training. In addition, aviation photographer Owen O’Rourke sent us a picture of a Bell 407 helicopter at Charlotte Douglas Airport in North Carolina in 2016. This helicopter is the same color and has virtually the same configuration as the three that have been flying around L.A., with the exception of the “egg-beater ” type satellite communications antenna on the tail boom. Flight tracking data had previously indicated that one of the trio of helicopters now in southern California had flown to North Carolina, possibly in the direction of Fort Bragg, a hub of U.S. special operations forces activity, on multiple occasions last year. A gray Bell 407 helicopter, with a virtually identical configuration to the ones that have been flying above the greater Los Angeles area recently, seen at Charlotte Douglas Airport in North Carolina in 2016., Owen O’Rourke The helicopter spotted at Charlotte Douglas five years ago also carries the U.S. civil registration code N407HP. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) database still lists a Bell 407 helicopter with this registration code and says the registrant is “TVXP Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee.” TVXP is a well-established broker of various aviation and other services, including providing trust services for registering aircraft with the FAA. It’s not clear whether the Bell 407 presently registered with the FAA is the same one that O’Rourke photographed in 2016. FAA says that the helicopter carrying the N407HP registration code today received its current airworthiness certificate in 2019. So, who exactly might be operating these helicopters remains murky, but they certainly look to have been conducting realistic urban training most typically associated with military special operations aviation units. UPDATE: All three of the helicopters were up tonight. We finally have some video of them in action over downtown Los Angeles: Also, apparently one of the helicopters visited Boise in 2017. Note, it didn’t have the tail-mounted SATCOM system: Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Armies B407 Helicopters Land U.S. Army"

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, plane spotters in the greater Los Angeles area caught glimpses of three mysterious Bell 407 helicopters painted overall in what looks to be a dark gray color, but with no easily identifiable markings. Covered in antennas that one might expect to see on examples in use by military or law enforcement units, but unlike any we at The War Zone are familiar with, the sightings immediately caught our attention. While we don’t know for sure who is operating them or for what purpose, these helicopters appear to have a very unusual history and there are solid indications that they could be associated with a very secretive U.S. military aviation unit. Chris Shaw of Shaw’s Aviation Photography was among the first to spot the trio as they arrived at Bob Hope Airport, also known as Hollywood Burbank Airport or KBUR, which is situated just north of Los Angeles, on Jan. 12, 2021. Later that day, plane spotter Scott Lowe caught a glimpse of two of the helicopters leaving that airport. One of the mysterious Bell 407 helicopters., Scott Lowe One of the mysterious Bell 407 helicopters seen heading toward Bob Hope/Hollywood Burbank Airport on Jan. 12., Chris Shaw (US Army Ret.) One of the Bell 407s seen leaving Bob Hope/Hollywood Burbank Airport on Jan. 12., Scott Lowe From what we can these helicopters each have an “ egg-beater ” or “ O Wing ” type UHF satellite communications (SATCOM) antenna on their tail booms. This installation is similar, if not identical to the one that the U.S. Army used on its now-retired OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopters, from which the commercial Model 407 was derived. They also have a pair of prominent blade-type antennas located ventrally under the fuselage, which are generally associated with high-frequency radios and other communications systems. Various other smaller antennas are also visible under the rear fuselage. The helicopters notably do not appear to have any kind of sensor turret of the types that typically hold electro-optical or infrared cameras underneath the nose or elsewhere beneath the fuselage. They are also equipped with high skids, which are commonly found on versions of the Jet Ranger family of helicopters that are tasked with utility work, law enforcement applications, and military missions.

They then returned to Burbank. The War Zone has already reached out to the Los Angeles County Fire Department for further information.

They made multiple stops along the way, including at Addington Field/Elizabethtown Regional Airport in Kentucky, Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, Flagstaff Pulliam Airport in Arizona, and Lake Havasu City Airport in Arizona, before arriving in Burbank. Their exact point of origin is unclear, but it seems most likely to have been somewhere on the central east coast. Audio of an exchange between the pilot of one of the helicopters and air traffic controllers at KBUR confirms that the trio were all Bell 407s and that the flight, as a whole, was using the callsign Mike 01. Using the lead aircraft’s callsign as the callsign for an entire flight is a typical practice within the U.S. military, especially U.S. Army special operations forces units. On Jan. 13, all three helicopters flew a route that took them first toward San Bernadino, to the east of Los Angeles, then down to the Pacific coast, between Huntington Beach and Long Beach. After that, they returned to Burbank.

Online flight tracking website ADS-B Exchange has identified the helicopters, via military-type transponders, as having “callsigns” that may be serial numbers – 121141, 121142, and 121143. Photographs Scott Lowe subsequently provided to The War Zone showed the helicopters have these serials written in black or dark blue on their tail booms. The serial number 12-1142 is clearly visible on the tail of this Bell 407., Scott Lowe The U.S. military did, for convenience, assign the serials 12-1141, 12-1142, and 12-1143, to a trio of Bell 407 helicopters that Iraq purchased, prior to their delivery to that country. “Three prototype aircraft will remain on Redstone [Arsenal in Alabama] in accordance with the Iraqis’ wishes for the aircraft’s future development and testing,” according to a U.S. Army news story in 2013. It’s not clear if those helicopters were the ones with these particular serials, but it seems very likely. Iraq may well have ultimately decided not to have had them delivered and transferred them to the U.S. military, that is if they were not still ‘owned’ technically by the United States in the first place. Regardless, the examples that Iraq did receive are in a configuration that is different from the ones recently seen flying near Los Angeles, though further development work on the aircraft that remained in the United States could have led to changes in their outward appearance. Reverting military variants of the Jet Ranger family to civilian configurations is hardly unheard of. It’s also worth noting that the United Arab Emirates also flies gray Bell 407s, but the paint is matte in nature, rather than the shiny paint on these new mystery helicopters, and again the configurations are different. An Iraqi IA-407 helicopter., DOD A UAE Bell 407., USN It’s worth remembering that the Army announced in 2017 that it was looking for vendors to supply up to 150 different Bell helicopters, including Model 407s, under a contract that would have also supported the needs of “other government agencies,” as well as foreign allies and partners. There are also some broad similarities between these helicopters and a number of Bell 407s that the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) operates. Its name notwithstanding, HRT is one of the U.S. government’s top-tier units for direct-action counter-terrorism operations at the national level. You can read more about this in this past War Zone piece . However. available pictures of the HRT Bell 407s show them painted in a distinct dark blue color and fitted with “ batwing ” type SATCOM antennas above the cockpit, rather than egg-beater-types on the tail boom. They are almost universally seen equipped with Tyler Technologies Tyler Special Operations Platforms (TSOP), plank-type arrangements that are mounted on either side of the helicopter that allow for the rapid insertion or extraction or personnel.

An FBI HRT UH-60M with egg-beater SATCOM antennas., FBI There is another possibility that these helicopters could belong to one of the U.S. military’s most shy aviation units, a U.S. Army element known today as the Aviation Technology Office (ATO). It was previously called the Flight Concepts Division (FCD) and it, as well as its predecessor organizations, also have deep ties to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This unit, which operates a wide array of aircraft, recently including Bell 407s, and foreign-made types, such as Russian Mi-17 Hips, is based at Felker Army Airfield at Fort Eustis in Virginia. A satellite image of Felker, dated Dec. 2, 2020, which The War Zone obtained from Planet Labs, shows three Bell 407s on the ramp, at least two of which appear to be of a similar color to the ones that have been flying over Los Angeles in the past few days.

They’re also tasked with developing what’s next in Army aviation. Sometimes those missions converge and the unit is understood to have led the development of the Stealth Hawks , the heavily modified UH-60 Black Hawk variants that were employed in the raid that led to the death of then-Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011. The general paint scheme and antenna configuration of this trio of Bell 407s are reminiscent in some ways of the configuration of a shadowy Hughes 369D helicopter photographed in what was then West Germany in 1987. That helicopter belonged to Seaspray, a joint Army-CIA aviation unit that is a predecessor to ATO/FCD. You can read more about that organization and that helicopter in this past War Zone piece. The hex code associated with the transponder on one of the mystery helicopters in southern California, AE69D1, shows up multiple times last year on flight tracking websites in the general area between Newport News and Virginia Beach in Virginia. Fort Eustis is just north of Newport News. There are also tracks heading in the general direction of Fort Bragg in neighboring North Carolina, which is an epicenter of U.S. military special operations forces activity, including the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The Dam Neck Annex at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach is also home to the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, better known as SEAL Team Six .

Army aircraft serials are in a similar format, but with five digits in the “Y” portion, instead of four. As such, this serial could be 19-1262 or 1-91262, though the latter would be incomplete. A cursory online search does not produce results for either formation. It’s also entirely possible that this a bogus serial, as could well be the case with the ones previously associated with the Iraqi Bell 407s. The U.S. Air Force has told the author on the record in the past that it provides serial numbers for aircraft belonging to other government agencies “as a matter of convenience,” specifically in response to records relating to the RB-69A Neptune . These Cold War spy planes were assigned Air Force designations and given Air Force serials, but were actually operated by the CIA. The style of the serial numbers, as well as the general circumstances surrounding these Bell 407s, also feels similar to the matter of an Mi-171E helicopter, a variant of the Russian Mi-17, which carries the Air Force style serial number 15-5207 on its tail. This helicopter, which is widely understood to be operated by the U.S. military, or some other arm of the U.S. government, was notably photographed at Bob Hope/Hollywood Burbank Airport in 2016.

In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the Air Force told The War Zone it had no record of this serial being assigned to an Mi-17 variant. Regardless, the Mi-17s fly regularly out of Felker Field. An Mi-17-type helicopter at Felker Army Airfield, which likely belongs to ATO/FCD., Bing Maps Still, while we know that Bell 407s are directly associated with ATO/FCD, we really don’t know with absolute certainty that the unit, or their Agency associates, are operating the mystery helicopters that have been spotted around Los Angeles, although the evidence strongly points to it. The fact that the serials line up with the left behind Iraqi Bell 407s is also quite telling. Regardless, their current operations are anything but clandestine, so they are bound to keep grabbing people’s attention.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Oct 20, 2021",North Korea’s New Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile Is Its Biggest Yet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Right on cue, after declaring the United States its biggest threat and announcing it was preparing for a new round of weapons tests, North Korea presented several examples of an apparently new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) during a parade in its capital, Pyongyang. The missiles and various other weapons rolled through Kim Il Sung Square under the gaze of the country’s leader Kim Jong Un as part of North’s Korea’s latest grand propaganda display of its growing military might. The missile is identified as the Pukguksong-5. At least four examples of the new weapon were on display transported on flatbed trucks. Though it’s not clear if these were mockups or not, the design looks to be a further development of the previous Pukguksong-3 and 4 missiles. A close-up of the Pukguksong-5 in yesterday’s parade., Korean Central News Agency North Korea first publicly revealed the Pukguksong-4 in October 2020 and there’s no indication that it has actually been test-fired yet. In October 2019, North Korea did announce that it had conducted a test launch of the Pukguksong-3, the country’s largest solid-fuel ballistic missile at that time, but this was from a submerged platform at sea rather than a submarine. There are some indications that the Pukguksong-5 is longer than the Pukguksong-4, possibly due to a revised nose section. It is also possible that the new weapon is somewhat wider than its predecessor, based on a rough visual comparison. The Pukguksong-3, 4, and now 5, are all substantially larger than the Pukguksong-1 SLBM and its ground-launched derivative, the Pukguksong-2. All of the ballistic missiles in the Pukguksong series are solid-fuel types, compared to the Hwasong series of liquid-fueled ballistic missiles, which includes the Hwasong 15 and 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). The giant Hwasong 16 intercontinental ballistic missile, which North Korea showcased for the first time in another military parade last October., Korean Central News Agency As The War Zone has discussed in the past, solid-fuel missiles mark a major advance for North Korea over its previous liquid-fuel technology. Not only are solid-fuel missiles much quicker to bring into action, as they do not require complex fueling preparations, but they are essentially a prerequisite for a safe and reliable submarine-launched ballistic missile capability. The tight confines of a submarine do not lend themselves to storing and pumping liquid rocket fuel into missiles and it would be an especially risky proposition in general given the volatile and corrosive nature of the propellant. While North Korea has been actively engaged in the development of SLBMs for some years now, the program to field a practical operational weapon that can be launched from a submerged submarine has had only limited success. To date, the Pukguksong-1 is the only missile North Korea is known to have actually fired from a submarine. In October 2019 , for the first time in three years, North Korea test-fired an SLBM from an offshore platform., Korean Central News Agency However, it is clear that Pyongyang is continuing to push ahead with its SLBM plans, including a project to convert an old Soviet-era Romeo class diesel electric attack submarine into a platform capable of launching ballistic missiles . This would seem to be part of a broader effort to develop a submarine-borne second-strike nuclear deterrent . The Korean Central News Agency described the new SLBM as the “ world’s mightiest ,” adding that some of the missiles on show in the parade could be used to “pre-emptively and completely destroy any enemy outside of our territory” — making clear that the Pukguksong-5 is intended to be a strategic weapon system. This would be in line with other North Korean ballistic missile efforts in recent years, including ICBMs that could be fired at targets well beyond the countries immediate neighbors, including potentially in the United States . Examples of any of the country’s ICBM designs were notably absent from this most recent parade. Meanwhile, the unveiling of this latest SLBM came only days after Kim Jong Un announced that the country would further expand North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and boost its overall military capabilities, outlining plans to field long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and “super-large warheads.” During the country’s latest Workers’ Party Congress, which lasted eight days and concluded on January 12, Kim had also said that the United States was its “ biggest enemy ,” noting that North Korea’s ongoing efforts to increase its military capabilities are necessary to defend itself against a possible U.S. invasion. Four flatbed trucks carrying Pukguksong-5 SLBMs, or mockups, roll into Kim Il Sung Square., Korean Central News Agency During the party congress, Kim claimed that the country has been developing a range of other sophisticated weapons, too, among them new tactical nuclear weapons, surveillance satellites, and hypersonic weapons. However, most relevant to the Pukguksong-5 SLBM is the reported work on a new nuclear-powered submarine that could be capable of carrying SLBMs. How realistic this project or any of the other aspirations are, remains extremely questionable, at best, but a nuclear ballistic missile submarine would clearly represent a huge advance over previous North Korea submarine programs. In the meantime, an operational version of the new Pukguksong-5 could perhaps be carried by the modified Romeo , work on which appears to still be ongoing. However, as already noted, it, as well as the Pukguksong-3 and 4, is notably larger than Pukguksong-1. It’s not clear if there would be adequate space inside a Romeo -based hullform to accommodate any of these bigger weapons, which could drive the need for an entirely new, larger submarine design. A “new” North Korean diesel-electric ballistic missile submarine, or SSB, was revealed in 2019 . However, it was in fact a significantly modified 1950s-era Romeo class attack sub and it is unclear what SLBMs it may be able to carry., NKStateMedia Whether or not the Pukguksong-5 can be accommodated within the confines of an existing, or adapted, submarine design may be academic, however. There is a good chance that the missile may find itself modified for land-based use as well. This would follow the same pattern as the previous Pukguksong-2, which became the KN-15 . In this way, North Korea can continue to build up a force of land-based medium-range ballistic missiles and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs). A land-based derivative of the Pukguksong-5 would, of course, retain the advantages inherent in its solid-fuel propulsion, above all its capacity for rapid launch . Beyond matters of practical weaponeering, all of these newly announced developments seem, at least in part, to be about applying pressure to the incoming Biden Administration in the United States, as well as signaling North Korea’s military might to South Korea. In the past, Biden has labeled the North Korean leader a “thug” and has been critical of President Trump’s approach to limiting North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. Bill Burns, Biden’s pick for the next head of the Central Intelligence Agency, has also been outspoken in his condemnation of Trump’s handling of North Korea, in particular. For his part, Kim has not ruled out further talks with the United States, but has called for Washington to abandon its hostile policy toward Pyongyang. During the Party Congress, he said that “no matter who is in power [in Washington], the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change.” On the other hand, North Korea’s stance on South Korea is as hardline as ever, officials taking the opportunity of the Party Congress to slam their neighbor for its alleged “misbehavior.” With all this in mind, it is anyone’s guess how relations between the Biden administration and Kim’s “Hermit Kingdom” will play out, but it seems more than likely that we should expect to see further progress made by North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile programs, whatever happens.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Nov 25, 2019",How British Tornados Used A Special Weapon To Ravage Saddam’s Airfields In Daring Desert Storm Raids,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. “With just a few seconds to run to the target, we got a red autopilot caption and the Tornado yawed violently after a massive bang on the left-hand side. I shouted to Paul, “We’ve been hit, we’ve been hit,” and he came back, “mark is good, continue.” So I stuffed the nose down, and re-engaged the terrain-following radar [TFR] — we were right at the point of weapon release. As we flew into a wall of tracer fire, Paul said “Committing.” I already had my “commit” button depressed — the weapons were coming off no matter what!” “I could see the airfield below lit up through the triple-A [AAA, anti-aircraft artillery] as our JP233 started releasing its munitions. Suddenly, as we’d been briefed, there were three massive bangs as the weapon canisters were automatically jettisoned. We came off target and I pulled us up into a climbing left-hand turn. The TFR had disengaged and Paul called “Height,” and by the time our wings were level, we were back down at 200 feet with the TFR on. It had lasted a matter of seconds, but it felt like hours! There was a palpable feeling of relief as we screamed away into the pitch black as fast as we could, leaving it all behind us.” A Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 in the “desert pink” Alkali Removable Temporary Finish (ARTF)., Ian Black These are the words of Nige Ingle, a young Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 pilot back in 1991, who flew some 15 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm with his navigator Paul McKernan. Exactly 30 years ago, British Tornado aircrews were tasked with some of the most demanding, important, and risky missions of the entire conflict. In particular, screaming in at very low-level over the most defended targets in Iraq and in the black of night to employ an exotic weapon exclusive to the Tornado that was meant to do one thing — tear apart the enemy’s runways and make it very dangerous for them to attempt repairs. Tornado on the front line The 1980s was an era in which the focus was on countering the Warsaw Pact threat to the east. The Panavia Tornado Interdictor Strike (IDS) was designed for that time — optimized to fight at low-level on the European front. British Tornado GR1 squadrons based in the U.K. and in Germany plied their trade skimming the treetops, and delivering unguided “dumb” bombs at high speed with great levels of accuracy. It was an environment in which RAF fast jet aircrews excelled, and it’s what they honed their skills for every day. Few could have expected that when the call to action came, the gray and green-painted Tornados and their aircrews were not plunged into nuclear combat against the vast Soviet war machine. Instead, they had to swiftly adapt to fight an unexpected foe in the deserts of the Middle East. For British Tornado GR1 pilot and navigator teams, that’s exactly what happened in 1990 as they joined a vast coalition of air assets that was being assembled to tackle Iraq and its tyrannical leader Saddam Hussein. The first few nights of the ensuing air campaign witnessed bravery in aerial combat in what proved to be the baptism of fire for the British Tornado force, which subsequently notched up an impressive service record on almost constant operations that lasted until the type’s retirement in 2019 . The accounts of the particular Tornado aircrews in this feature bear witness to one of the most incredible chapters in the history of aerial warfare. Heading to the desert When Iraqi forces invaded neighbouring Kuwait in the early hours of August 2, 1990, repercussions echoed around the world. With concerns that Saddam Hussein might order his forces to plough on into Saudi Arabia, a path to potential conflict quickly formed. With over 500 fighter and bomber aircraft, Iraq possessed one of the most powerful air forces on the planet. The threat from Iraq and its formidable air force was taken very seriously indeed. An RAF Tornado GR1 banks away from a Tornado F3 during the work-up period before Desert Storm., Ian Black To counter Iraqi aggression, a huge air armada began to be assembled in the Persian Gulf, led by the United States. The Tornado GR1s would form the backbone of a British strike force, alongside SEPECAT Jaguar GR1s, and later, veteran Blackburn Buccaneers, supported by tankers, helicopters and transport aircraft. The hastily assembled coalition air force was quickly integrated into a huge plan to stop Saddam’s forces in its tracks, and liberate Kuwait. The RAF deployed the first squadron of Tornado GR1s to the Gulf on August 27, 1990, as No 14 Squadron departed RAF Brüggen, Germany, for Muharraq, Bahrain, decked out in a new “desert pink” Alkali Removable Temporary Finish (ARTF). RAF Germany (RAFG) supplied the initial bulk of the Tornado assets for Operation Granby — as the U.K.’s part of the massive operation was known. Once the initial British build-up was complete, three reinforced squadrons each averaging 15 aircraft and 24 crews were in position at Muharraq, as well as at Dhahran and Tabuk in Saudi Arabia. Steve Warren-Smith was a young Flight Lieutenant on his first frontline tour as a Tornado pilot, assigned to No 17 Squadron at Brüggen, when he and some of his colleagues were swiftly dispatched to Bahrain. “Unlike the Tornado squadrons at RAF Marham, none of the eight Germany-based squadrons were qualified to conduct air-to-air refueling, because we were considered to be close enough to the Cold War front line. So initially, there was a huge push to get the RAF Germany Tornado squadrons qualified to take fuel from the tanker, which in its own right was a mad scramble.” “One guy got the air refueling drogue down his intake before he managed to slow down enough. Another one sailed straight past the basket and popped out his airbrakes, which the drogue promptly snagged upon. This was closely followed by a hail of ball bearings and springs as he dropped back and the basket disintegrated.” Once in theater, the Tornado crews took their well-practiced Cold War-era tactics that were honed on the plains of Northern Germany and adapted them to the desert environment. The Tornados generally worked as four-ship teams, training with everything from the Hunting JP233 runway denial bomblet-dispensing weapon, to 1,000-pound general-purpose bombs, the latter in low-level lay-down and loft delivery profiles. Tornado GR1 ZA354 carrying JP233 test rounds during trials in 1983., BAE Systems “We did a lot of operational low flying [OLF, flying at 100 feet] and a lot of night work,” recounts Mark Roberts, at that time a Flight Lieutenant junior pilot on No 16 Squadron deployed to Tabuk. “The low-level really prepared us well on the basis that we had no idea what we’d be doing when it came to operations. So, being honed for low-level by day or night was a really good thing for us. The value of the training made us really sharp, which meant we could cope with whatever was thrown at us.” The Tornado crews intensely practiced using the built-in terrain-following radar (TFR) , which enabled them to fly hands-off on autopilot at 200 feet above the desert floor. Night-vision goggles were available to some crews later in the war, but in the early stages, the Tornado pilots were offered a hand-held system that nobody used. Unlike the forests and plains of northern Europe, the undulating sand dunes of Saudi Arabia didn’t give the TFR a very good radar return, and so the radar altimeter (radalt) became a vital tool for avoiding the ground. During the work-up period, it became clear that the Tornados could be called upon to tackle Saddam Hussein’s sprawling airfields, mainly due to their excellent low-level skills. The Tornado and JP233 combination was perfectly suited to the task. The Tornados would need to attack at ultra-low level in order to best avoid the ring of air defenses at these bases, and to accurately deliver their highly specialized, runway-destroying weapon. Using the JP233 was aimed at keeping the feared Iraqi Air Force firmly on the ground as the airfields were taken out of action — better to strand them or kill them on the ground than fight them in the air. A Tornado GR1 deploys the JP233 system during testing at West Freugh in the U.K. in 1983., BAE Systems Tornado and the JP233 The Hunting JP233 was one of the Tornado GR1’s primary weapons. During the Cold War, the idea behind it was to close down Soviet airfields, thus nullifying any potential air support for ground forces. Taking out the Soviet bases meant that NATO forces would stand a better chance of holding their ground. The Tornados of the German Luftwaffe and the Italian Aeronautica Militare Italiano opted for a different runway denial system, the MW-1. Development of the JP233 system dates back to 1977. It consisted of two huge 21-foot 5-inch-long dispenser pods, weighing a combined 5,148 pounds, that were attached to the underside shoulder pylons of the Tornado GR1 fuselage. Each pod consisted of two sections, the rear portion containing 30 SG357 57-pound runway-busting concrete-penetrators, and the front housing 215 HB876 5.5-pound area-denial submunitions, with both types of sub-munitions being retarded by small parachutes. The larger SG357 two-stage munitions featured a long, smaller-diameter forward section that included a cylindrical high-explosive charge with a hole in the middle. The shorter, larger-diameter, rear section accommodated a shaped charge. A telescopic fuze at the front of the SG357 created the exact detonation distance for the shaped charge. When the submunition impacted the surface, the fuze initiated this shaped charge, which created a molten metal “spear” that shot through the forward portion and the concrete to create an underground void. The cylindrical high-explosive charge followed this down into the ground before exploding, which was intended to create a crater with significant “heave” at the edges, thus resulting in significant damage to the area around the crater that couldn’t be easily repaired. The JP233’s submunitions falling and wreaking absolute havoc on an improved surface. , Public Domain The HB876 was a particularly nasty anti-personnel mine — designed to spread across the rubble and detonate at specific intervals, or if disturbed, in order to hinder repair operations. The outside of the HB876 featured sprung steel strips. After landing a small explosive device fired to release the strips, which served to stand the mine upright, with the fragment warhead pointing upwards. When detonated, it would fire anti-personnel fragments in all directions. The first JP233 test flight was flown over the range at West Freugh, U.K., on February 23, 1982, using a British Aerospace flight trials Tornado (ZA354/BS07). Trials continued throughout 1983 with the release of the munitions, initially from height, and then at lower levels, including against a prepared surface to confirm its concrete-busting performance. The testing also included separation of the JP233 containers, which housed the sub-munitions, and would automatically fall away from the Tornado when the weapon was done spewing out its deadly cargo. JP233 was issued to the RAF front line in April 1985. Despite operational evaluation trials conducted in the U.S., none of the frontline RAF Tornado squadrons had used JP233 until it was broken out of its crates in preparation to be used in anger over Iraq’s airfields in 1991. Indeed, there weren’t even any training rounds with which to simulate its carriage, they were all live rounds. Practice was restricted to the simulator or to carrying fuel tanks under the fuselage. The initial tactic for the JP233 was to fly straight down the runway to deploy the bomblets, which floated down on parachutes. However, accurately delivering the weapon was a challenge. If there was any crosswind or if the run was slightly offline, the rain of destruction would be neatly aligned down the side of the runway, leaving it untouched. Moreover, this delivery profile was very predictable. It required the aircraft to be flown in a straight line, wings level, right down the centerline of the runway — usually one of, if not the most highly defended pieces of real estate in the enemy’s entire portfolio. The weapon had two modes, one for a faster munitions release over a shorter distance, and a slower release that would spread the weapon over a longer stretch of the flight path. The RAF preferred to use the faster release profile, scattering the munitions across runways and taxiways to cut them, instead of along their length, which was considered more predictable and prone to missing the target completely. The Tornado crews became all too aware of how well the Iraqi airfields had been designed and engineered, with multiple parallel taxiways that were also stressed for use as runways. Putting even a single Iraqi airfield out of action would be a huge undertaking. A three-ship of JP233-toting Tornados during training in the Gulf in late 1990., Steve Warren-Smith “We trained to either cross the runway to cut it up, or to fly down it, and it had two delivery modes: 7.6 seconds or 19, for the two rates of spread,” explains Steve Warren-Smith. “JP233 had to be delivered at around 160 feet, wings level, with no G or angle-of-bank. So you had to fly with very precise parameters for it to be delivered effectively. If you were too high some of the sub-munitions could drift off downwind. Over a peacetime range is one thing, but to do it over an airfield in the pitch black where everyone’s firing at you is quite another!” An added complication was that the TFR was calibrated for 200 feet, and it wasn’t capable of flying the aircraft at the 160-foot height that was optimum for employing the JP233. It meant the pilot needed to deselect terrain following and hand-fly the aircraft with a radar height hold of 160 feet on the radar altimeter, in the pitch black of night, without night-vision goggles or a forward-looking infrared, if they were to achieve an optimum release height. Training for war The three Tornado detachments in the Gulf spent the last months of 1990 engaged in intense work-ups for what lay ahead. One of the specific training requirements was to low-fly with the JP233 pods fitted, both day and night. However, this presented a problem. The RAF only had live rounds, and the explosive lugs that attached the huge weapon system to the aircraft were only stressed for 1.5 missions. It meant each pod could do a takeoff and landing, but a second mission would require the system to be employed or jettisoned — the Tornado couldn’t land back with the JP233 still attached. The solution was to fly each live system once, then park it ready for if hostilities kicked-off. “At the end of each training mission from Muharraq we would “hoover” down the runway at Sheikh Isa Air Base with the weapons package selected to fly a JP233 delivery profile at 160 feet,” explains Steve Warren-Smith. “Because we couldn’t actually drop the weapon in training, we just had our HUD [head-up display] symbology with a bomb-fall line to go by. We could fly down a runway, but without the weapon actually coming off, you didn’t really know how effective you’d been!” An RAF Tornado GR1 over the desert with wings swept fully forward., Ian Black It became apparent that the number of sorties needed to familiarize each Tornado crew with JP233 could have an adverse effect on available live rounds. A solution was developed whereby manufacturer Hunting modified a complete JP233 system with weighted concrete ballast in place of the explosive charges. With beefed-up lugs, this training store would be available for multiple sorties. “On December 1, 1990, my four-ship was scheduled for a night training sortie,” says Warren-Smith. “My nav and I were allocated the JP233 training round. I had become increasingly aware of the impending conflict, and of making sure we had the training nailed so we didn’t get all the way to the target and then do something wrong. In fact, it was at the forefront of my mind.” “When you dropped a JP233, rather than going “now” the pilot held the “commit” button on top of the stick and once the bomb-fall line hit the target the computer would release the weapon. The plan is that you commit, the munitions come out at the computed point, and then the containers fall away automatically 1.5 seconds after the dispensing process is complete. We didn’t have any specific briefing on this training round, and as we walked out to the jet we decided that as there was nothing live on it, we should be as realistic as possible and do all the switches and the commit on our run.” “Our target was a geographical waypoint in a very flat part of the Saudi Arabian desert. We got airborne, in-flight refueled and then dropped into low level at 200 feet on the TFR in the black of night. As we made our run, we went through the switches and committed the “weapon.” Suddenly the explosive release lugs went bang and the whole 5.5 tons of the two pods came off! The autopilot threw us into a 3.5-G pullup as it thought something had gone wrong. We left the whole thing in the desert!” “That was the end of the JP233 training round.” A Tornado GR1 from the Muharraq detachment with JP233s loaded., Ian Black When the RAF initially deployed Tornados into the theater in August 1990, it sent some of its most experienced Qualified Weapons Instructors and Flight Commanders. The policy of a three-month roulement meant that some of the crews that were deployed right at the start — notably those at Muharraq — started to return home despite all the experience and work-ups that had been completed. Steve Warren-Smith and many of his colleagues in Bahrain — who had spent three months honing their skills in the desert — headed back to Germany in early January. In their place, a fresh influx of personnel arrived, and these new crews, many of which included some very junior officers, had very little time to get up to speed with the challenges of desert operations as conflict loomed. Nige Ingle was a young Pilot Officer on No 617 Squadron “Dambusters” at RAF Marham, in his first year flying the Tornado GR1. “As all the experienced guys had gone to the Gulf; it left a gene pool of us doing combat work-ups and others who didn’t have the required hours to deploy. I just managed to accrue sufficient hours to get permission from my boss Wg Cdr Bob Iveson to do the Gulf work-up. We flew with heavy weapons [1,000-pound dumb bombs], did night TFR, and operational low flying down to 100 feet. In my heart of hearts, I thought we’d end up deploying, but that Saddam Hussein would call it quits, and I’d come home fully qualified!” “Our experience of JP233 was that we had the software in the jet, and we knew we needed to fly down the centerline of the runway to use it. That was it,” says Ingle. “They’d worked out that if they put the big 2,250-liter [594 US gallon] tanks on the jet and the two JP233 pods, plus a full load of fuel, the aircraft would be above its maximum take-off weight. I remember the boss of No 617 Squadron proved it could be done by flying a jet in this configuration at Marham.” A dismantled JP233 pod showing the rear and front sections. , USAF Wrecking Saddam’s airfields The day before Operation Desert Storm was launched, the various crews around the Gulf region were told that they were going to war. The Iraqi Air Force was considered to be a formidable opponent, and the RAF entered the conflict with the same level of expectation and preparedness as if it was meeting the Soviet forces in Europe. Four jets from the Dhahran detachment and eight from Muharraq were the first RAF Tornado GR1s into Operation Desert Storm as the air campaign started in the early hours of January 17, 1991 . Each clutching a pair of JP233s, they were tasked with taking out Iraqi airfields in a bid to keep Saddam’s air force on the ground. In the dead of night, the Tornados taxied out to their respective runways in radio silence to maintain operational security. “Our objective was to sever access to the runways from the hardened aircraft shelter dispersals at each corner of the airfield, thought to be easier to achieve than putting two runways out of action,” explained Mal Craghill, who was assigned to No 16 Squadron at Tabuk. “In what would become a familiar pattern, we would have “area support” from fighters sweeping a wide area ahead of us for enemy aircraft, electronic attack aircraft jamming surface-to-air missile [SAM] radars, and aircraft capable of shooting anti-radiation missiles at any radars which did threaten us. These aircraft were not dedicated to our formation, but knew where we would be at any given time to ensure they could protect us.” Led by their respective detachment commanders, the first Tornado “package” launched shortly before 01:00 AM local time headed for Tallil Air Base, near Nasiriyah. This base housed at least one squadron of fighters. Meanwhile, just over an hour later Wg Cdr Travers-Smith led a four-ship of GR1s out of Tabuk towards Al Asad Air Base, to the north of Ramadi, and home to two Iraqi MiG squadrons. A Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 flying at low level over the Saudi Arabian desert., RAF/Crown Copyright For Mark Roberts, he was to fly the first of his 26 Desert Storm missions as number three in a four-ship formation. “I flew at the end of the first wave for a JP233 attack on Al Asad. I remember as we were flying low across the desert at a couple of hundred feet, we could see the triple-A lighting up from about 200 miles away. We commented: “Christ, thank goodness we’re not going there,” only to turn onto our final attack heading to realize that it was exactly where we were going.” “As I approached the target I remember quite vividly that the triple-A was being arc-fired. I disconnected the autopilot and flew low across the airfield into what felt like a wall of lead. We flew right into it and your senses tell you that everything is going upwards, so the visual stimuli is that you’re going downwards. We were doing a coordinated attack and I remember looking across and seeing the JP233 going off [on another jet] and effectively saying ‘I’m here!’ right inside the triple-A ring. Then we went from all the visual stimuli in the world to absolutely nothing. All I could see was the triple-A in my mirrors.” Nige Ingle and Paul McKernan deployed to Bahrain on January 1, 1991, to complete a No 27 Squadron four-ship, which was attached to No XV Squadron. The timing meant they flew a total of seven work-up sorties in theater, but they had no experience of flying with the JP233. Yet on night two of the campaign, they were preparing to fly their first combat mission, and it was to be a JP233 raid. Muharraq was to launch eight jets — four to attack Shaibah Air Base, and another four-ship was tasked to hit Ubaydah bin al Jarrah Air Base, near Kut. “We actually lost the toss for the mission, so our formation got the longer flight that required two pre-strike tanker brackets. We were told the best thing to do was to sleep during the day, then stay awake at night to be ready for the attacks in the darkness. Neither Paul or I slept a wink for what must have been 24 hours before the mission — I’ve never felt as tired as I did for that first combat sortie,” Ingle recalls. A Tornado GR1 on the flight line at Muharraq, Bahrain, armed with live JP233s., Ian Black Ingle and navigator Flight Lieutenant Paul McKernan were to be the number four aircraft in the four-ship. “Our formation leader planned the sortie, and we pitched up at the brief to hear that we’d be tanking twice with JP233 loaded before we went low level, supported by four F-15Cs , four F-111s, four F-4Gs and two EF-111 Ravens,” McKernan recalls. “The first time we came face-to-face with a JP233 was on the evening of January 17 when we walked out to the jet and it had these two big wardrobes strapped underneath it!” The al Jarrah formation left Muharraq at midnight local time. “Night formation, flying an overweight jet, and taking JP233 with us to the tanker was a challenge in itself,” says Ingle. “After departing the tanker we dived down into low level and turned our lights out as we went across the border. Paul was very busy operating the kit and getting the navigation fixes, which was the most important thing that we had to do.” “The airfield itself at al Jarrah had been under attack for a considerable time before we got there,” Paul McKernan continues. “That was most definitely not Tornado Standard Operating Procedure — we liked to sneak in, drop the weapons, and clear off before anyone knew that we were there.” “Soon after we had tanked, the number three jet had a problem and had to turn back. Shortly after crossing the Iraqi border we were locked and fired upon by a Roland SAM. Nige spotted the missile and did an evasive maneuver and chaff was dispensed. Thanks to the efforts of the SEAD [suppression of enemy air defense] aircraft the target was easily visible as a huge orange glow on the horizon. None of us had seen triple-A before, and we thought how on Earth are we going to get through all of that?” Flt Lt Paul McKernan (left) and FO Nige Ingle during Operation Granby, as the British participation in Desert Storm was known., Paul McKernan Ingle picks up the story: “At a range of around 18 miles to go we were told we should select full combat power [afterburner] and leave that in until around six miles to run, then go to max dry power so we were absolutely as fast as possible, but without the reheat “carrots” coming out the back to give away our position as we ran over the target. I decided that speed was what we needed, so when Paul said cut the burners at six miles, I kept them in for a bit longer. For the run, we were given a choice. We could leave the autopilot terrain-following radar in, which would take us over the target at 200 feet, or we could fly manually down to a height we were comfortable with. With very few hours on the Tornado, I elected to stay on autopilot.” The remaining Tornados in the formation were offset to the right of the lead aircraft, with 20 seconds trail spacing between each jet, hugging the desert floor. As if they didn’t have enough to do, Ingle and McKernan’s final attack run was interrupted with 2.5 miles to run when what was initially thought to be triple-A hit the port wing. “The aircraft rose to 600 feet but we rapidly got back down to 200 feet,” says McKernan. “I was head down in the radar scope, but it was horrendously bright in the cockpit with all the triple-A. Having gone all that way and worked ourselves through that orange dome of fire, we were damn sure we were going to hit what we were aiming for, and we did!” Ingle recalls that when the JP233 was deploying its sub-munitions it felt like driving a car over cobblestones; another navigator said it was like driving over a cattle grid. Coming off the target run, with JP233 canisters punched-off, and running south at the speed of heat for the border, Ingle remembered the huge bang and yaw on the final run-in. “We were still flying, so it couldn’t be too bad.” The leading-edge wing slats had stopped working and he couldn’t sweep the Tornado’s wings forward from their 45-degree position. The three jets all landed safely and taxied in after what had been a grueling four-hour and 10-minute mission. As they stepped from the cockpit, a television crew awaited Ingle and McKernan. “How was it?” They filmed the weary pair as they inspected the wing to find that the impact hadn’t been Iraqi bullets, but instead a large bird that they’d hit as they screamed towards al Jarrah. Back in the temporary squadron building, the three crews got together to debrief what they had just done. The sheer enormity of the task they’d achieved started to sink in. “With the debrief complete, the other formation, which had gone to Shaibah, came to see us. One of the pilots was in bits,” Ingle recalls. “They didn’t tell us until we’d got everything finished that they’d lost one of the Tornados in their formation.” They’d seen the commanding officer of No 27 Squadron, Wg Cdr Nigel Elsdon, and his navigator Flt Lt “Max” Collier, go down during their JP233 attack. Both were tragically killed. Intense first days In the early hours of January 19, Ingle and McKernan were back in action. This time, they were part of a package of eight Tornados assigned to No 27 Squadron that were again tasked with attacking the Iraqi airfield at Tallil. The lead four-ship was to loft 1,000-pound dumb bombs into the airfield, which were designed to airburst over the SAM emplacements. Then the JP233-armed four-ship would make their run. “Our formation was 40 seconds behind the first,” recalls Ingle. “So we could avoid the frag from their bombs. I saw the number two jet in their formation get shot down. It was Dave Waddington and Robbie Stewart, and they’d been hit by a Roland SAM.” Flt Lts Waddington and Stewart were taken prisoner, enduring six weeks of captivity and interrogation in Iraq before being released at the end of the war. During the first four nights of the war, the Tornado crews flew 53 JP233 raids against Iraqi airfields, expending 106 JP233s. After five days, thanks to a mix of coalition successes, it was decided that the threat from Saddam’s air force had been suitably reduced. The intense low-level raids had taken their toll on the RAF Tornados, with four jets lost during these raids and four aircrew killed. The Tornados were instructed to change tactics to fly at medium level at around 20,000 feet, where only the larger SAMs could cause them problems. Much of this threat had by now been diminished by the activities of the coalition SEAD aircraft. “Switching to medium-level operations on January 22 took a bit of the intensity out of it,” recounts Mark Roberts. All the Tornado units started flying at medium-level and used 1,000-pound freefall bombs as the Tornado crews took their existing tactics and employed them at higher altitudes. Then came one of the major breakthroughs of the campaign. Both the Muharraq and Dhahran detachments began working with Pave Spike laser designator pod -equipped Buccaneers from February 2 and 5 respectively, before Tornados equipped with TIALD (Thermal Imaging and Laser Designator) pods began arriving at Tabuk on February 10. The advent of laser-guidance enabled the Tornados to attack targets such as bridges and individual hardened aircraft shelters with precision using Paveway II laser-guided bombs . Three JP233 Tornado GR1s on a mission from Muharraq., Mike Lumb The end of JP233 While JP233 had an important role to play in Desert Storm, its delivery profile resulted in some of the most dangerous missions of the entire air war. Designed in the depths of the Cold War, it was reliant on having a delivery aircraft directly over the target at very low level, making a long and predictable target run. What the RAF Tornado aircrews did on those first few nights of Desert Storm was unbelievably brave. While the Tornado crews were told whether or not their JP233 attacks had hit their intended targets, the overall success of the employment of the system against Iraqi airfields was subject to a classified report after the war. SG357 concrete-penetrators spill from the rear portion of the JP233 during testing., BAE Systems The JP233 was initially planned to remain in service until at least 2005, but the British Landmines Bill of July 1998 put an end to JP233. While the bill didn’t prohibit the use of airfield denial weapons, JP233 was ruled out by the Ottawa Convention and British legislation prohibited the use in any circumstances of any weapon classified as an anti-personnel landmine. All HB876 bomblets were to be destroyed by January 1, 2000, and the SG357 submunitions (which did not contravene the Ottawa Convention) by the end of 2002. To achieve this timetable, JP233 was planned for withdrawal from service in August 1998. It was decided that the advent of modern, precision-guided weapons such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile, which was carried by the Tornado operationally from 2003, more than mitigated the removal of JP233 from the British inventory, although clearly these weapons were not specifically designed to take out airfields in the manner of the JP233. A JP233 on display underneath a Tornado GR1 at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force., USAF An era of dramatic change Operation Desert Storm book-ended the Cold War era of the RAF, which was built around a strict doctrine that was purposely designed to meet the threat from the Warsaw Pact. The RAF Tornados went to war at low level with unguided weapons and emerged versed in smart munitions and pinpoint attacks. Ironically, as the peace dividend brought about huge defense cutbacks, both the British and U.S. military entered a period of sustained combat operations in the Middle East that continue to this day. When the RAF Tornado crews were sent to the Middle East to confront Iraq, there was very little actual combat experience on the RAF front line. Desert Storm laid the bedrock for a whole new era of warfighting for the modern RAF. One in which the service could strike a point of its choice, at a time of its choosing. The events of January 1991 heralded a step-change in the way the RAF Tornados conducted business, switching away from the low-level focus towards medium-level tactics with increased use of smart weapons. RAF crews proved that they were able to quickly move away from rigid tactics and that they were highly adaptable and capable of adopting new techniques, even during high-intensity combat operations — making a huge impact on the overall campaign. “When I think about it, it was quite extraordinary what we did when you compare it with the way things are done today — with night-vision goggles, forward-looking infrared, standoff weapons — but actually what we did back then was really advanced for its time,” commented one Tornado pilot. Overall, six RAF Tornados were lost during combat operations in Desert Storm. These losses were mistaken by some as an indication that the Tornado was incapable of undertaking its intended mission, and that they were forced to switch to medium level. In fact, attacking those Iraqi airfields on the first few nights had to be undertaken at low level. No other aircraft or aircrews were better suited to perform these treacherous missions. Neutralizing Iraq’s airfields played a significant part in the coalition achieving air superiority, which in turn meant the Tornados could safely switch to medium-level operations. One pilot commented: “We knew Iraq had an advanced air defense system and a significant air threat and we believed they’d be up for the fight.” Ingle and McKernan flew together throughout the air war, completing some 15 incredible combat missions. “Our Qualified Weapons Instructor was experienced and he had a seasoned perspective, and our backs,” says Ingle. “And I’d have followed our formation leader to the end of the Earth.” Looking back at the events of those nights in the cockpit of a Tornado some 30 years ago, McKernan and Ingle have an impenetrable bond that was forged in the heat of battle. “We set out to do what we were asked to do, and to do it as well as we could.” It’s easy to see why some retrospectively drew parallels between what the Tornado crews did on those first few nights over Iraq with some of the RAF’s World War II operations, such as the “Dambusters” raid on Germany’s Ruhr Valley. The quietly professional RAF Tornado community was always keen to avoid such comparisons. Overall, the 61 deployed RAF Tornado GR1s flew some 2,535 sorties in Desert Storm, employing 106 JP233s, and dropping 3,631 unguided 1,000-pound bombs, and 1,079 laser-guided bombs. The Tornados also flew 140 reconnaissance sorties and fired some 113 Air-Launched Anti-Radiation Missiles (ALARMs) on SEAD missions. The British Tornado story is just one chapter of Desert Storm, an air campaign that helped to shape the face of modern aerial warfare. Some 30 years on, the accounts from aircrews that took part in the massive air war bear testament to the significance of their contributions and their unflinching approach to the missions that they were asked to fly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",Report Adds Further Evidence Iran’s Soleimani Was Killed By New Highly Precise Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details contained in a new Pentagon report add to the already mounting evidence that the U.S. military used an AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) to kill Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq just over a year ago. In addition, it strongly suggests that these missiles have been employed in other strikes that may have been carried out by the secretive Joint Special Operations Command or the Central Intelligence Agency dating back to at least 2016. A direct confirmation that JAGMs have been used against unspecified “classified counterinsurgency targets such as truck[s] and motorcycles” was included in the latest annual report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, which was publicly released on Jan. 14, 2020. This review covers test and evaluation activities related to a number of high-profile projects, including the AGM-179A, which were conducted during the 2020 Fiscal Year that began on Oct. 1, 2019 and ended on Sept. 30, 2020. A fragment of a missile reportedly recovered after the strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020., via Twitter Officially, JAGM entered low-rate initial production in 2018 and the U.S. Army declared initial operational capability with the missile in 2019. However, operational test and evaluation activities are still ongoing as part of efforts to integrate the weapon onto U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy aircraft. DOT&E’s report highlights a number of issues the missiles have experienced in testing so far. These include the height of burst sensor detonating the warhead too early when engaging personnel in the open, the need for extreme cold weather testing to assess the weapon’s ability to perform in the increasingly strategic Arctic region , and problems encountered during the integration of the weapon onto the Marine’s AH-1Z attack helicopter . However, the admission that the JAGM has been employed operationally is by far the most interesting detail in the report. In addition, it includes a rendering of the missile with a visible data plate at the back that reads: WARNING 2-MAN LIFT WT: 52.0kg/115LB These markings are significant, but more on that in a moment. Also, while this is not a picture of an actual AGM-179A, it is apparently representative enough of the real missile that the dual-mode seeker in the nose is blurred out. The rendering of an AGM-179A JAGM from the 2020 DOT&E report., DOD The JAGM program traces back to 2007, as a follow-on to the abortive AGM-169A Joint Common Missile effort. In 2012, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon both received initial contracts to develop competing designs for the missile, with Lockheed Martin’s offering winning out the following year. The resulting AGM-179A is effectively a heavily modified AGM-114R Hellfire II , with a new dual-mode guidance package in the nose. JAGM can zero in on its target using either semi-active laser homing or a millimeter-wave radar seeker. It also has the ability to leverage the capabilities of both at once, initially finding the target via laser guidance and then switching over to the radar. Hellfire variants are available with both of these guidance options, but not both together on a single missile. A briefing slide showing a general breakdown of the components of the AGM-179A JAGM, including portions directly carried over from the AGM-114R Hellfire., US Army This combination makes the weapon extremely flexible and allows it to engage threats even in conditions where the beam from a laser designator might be blocked by clouds or other obscurants, and even suddenly during the terminal phase of flight. There have been discussions in the past about the development of future variants that could feature tri-mode guidance systems, adding in an imaging infrared capability, as well as greater range and other improvements. Though it leverages a lot of the existing AGM-114R design, the new nose section does mean that the JAGM it’s slightly heavier than a Hellfire. The Army says that it weighs 52 kilograms , or approximately 115 pounds. With the exception of the AGM-114K variant, all versions of the Hellfire II family presently in U.S. service have publicly stated weights of 49 kilograms, or around 109 pounds. An official Army infographic that provides details on various Hellfire variants, including their weights., US Army All of this would seem pretty esoteric if not for the fact that a fragment of one of the missiles reportedly recovered after the Soleimani strike had the exact same markings as seen on the rendering of the JAGM in this new DOT&E report. There had already been speculation at the time that these missiles, rather than Hellfires, had been employed in that strike. The U.S. military, however, has never confirmed that JAGMs were used to kill Soleimani. The Army has also blurred out the markings on the rear of the missile in pictures it has publicly released in the past from testing, which has always seemed odd since the weight data is not classified. A picture of a JAGM from a US Army test in 2019 with the weight data blurred out., US Army DOT&E’s note that these missiles have been employed again “classified counterinsurgency targets,” plural, as well as the mention of motorcycles being struck – Qassem Soleimani was riding in an SUV when he died – also provides strong additional evidence linking JAGMs to other strikes. Pictures do exist of missile fragments that initially looked to be from Hellfires, but which have the 52 kilogram weight markings, from at least two other strikes in Syria. The first of these was an alleged U.S. drone strike against an SUV in Idlib city in northwestern Syria in 2016. The second was a controversial strike on what locals said was a mosque near the village of Al Jinah, situated in the country’s northwestern Aleppo governorate, which reportedly killed dozens of innocent civilians. The U.S. military did acknowledge it had carried out that latter strike, but said had it struck a known meeting place for Al Qaeda-linked terrorists and that a mosque, which it left untouched, was across the street. It’s worth noting that northwestern Syria has been generally off-limits to the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, but has seen a number of U.S. airstrikes since 2016. Some of these, including the Al Jinah strike, have been publicly acknowledged by the U.S. military and have primarily targeted individuals tied to Al Qaeda . A number of these strikes have also been carried out in the same general region of Syria using the AGM-114R9X Hellfire missile, which has a warhead consisting of pop-out sword-like blades rather than a traditional explosive charge. You can read more about this weapon, which is understood to be used almost exclusively by JSOC and the CIA, in this past War Zone story . In addition, in August 2020, the U.S. military acknowledged losing two MQ-9 Reaper drones flying over northwestern Syria, saying the two unmanned aircraft collided in mid-air . In the period leading up to that incident, locals had taken pictures and video of MQ-9s with unusual loadouts, including what appeared to be gray-colored missiles. The base color of all known Hellfire variants is black, but JAGMs have been seen painted in gray and green color schemes. A gray-colored JAGM prototype next to a Hellfire missile under the wing of a US Army MQ-1C drone circa 2015., Lockheed Martin It wouldn’t be surprising that JSOC and the CIA had gotten early access to these weapons. These organizations have a long history of being early adopters of new weapons and other technology, as well as fielding highly specialized and novel munitions and other systems, such as the R9X Hellfire variant. As noted, the JAGM’s dual-mode seeker offers distinct advantages over Hellfires and an increased chance of successfully scoring a hit, regardless of any environmental factors. This would even more desirable than usual for targeting specific high-value individuals where the engagement window might be very small and the opportunities to engage at all may be extremely rare. With all this in mind, the potential decision of using the new JAGM to kill Qassem Soleimani, a particularly sensitive target, in an equally sensitive location, seemed to have made good sense, from a weaponeering perspective, and it now seems to have almost certainly been the case.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Apr 15, 2021",Russia Should Ditch Its Cursed Aircraft Carrier And Focus On Its Two New Amphibious Assault Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The latest photos of the Russian Navy’s sole aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov , currently undergoing a prolonged refit, suggest that work on the warship has more or less stopped in the last 12 months. At the same time, Russian media reports indicate that the two new amphibious assault ships under construction for the country’s navy will be even bigger than previously thought. Ultimately, these new warships would provide the Russian Navy with a much more flexible, affordable, and useful alternative to the Admiral Kuznetsov , even though it’s unlikely they will ever embark fixed-wing manned aircraft. Above all that, eliminating the trouble-plagued Kuznetsov once and for all would free up funding that would allow Russia to make its amphibious ships everything they possibly can be. The Center for Analysis of Strategy and Technologies , or CAST, a Moscow-based defense think-tank has analyzed recently published photos of the Admiral Kuznetsov during its refit and concluded that “there has been no particular work done on the ship in the last year.” The images, which show the snow-covered carrier’s island superstructure surrounded with scaffolding and no apparent workers on the ship itself, were originally posted to Instagram earlier this month by user Lana Sator , but it is unclear exactly when they were taken. The photos can be seen further below in this article. The Admiral Kuznetsov alongside the dock in Murmansk., LEV FEDOSEYEV/TASS/GETTY IMAGES The Admiral Kuznetsov has been docked at the Zvezdochka ship repair yard in Murmansk, on the Barents Sea in Russia’s far northwest, ever since concluding its last combat deployment to the eastern Mediterranean, which began in late 2016 and ended the following year. This was the first time the aircraft carrier had taken part in an active conflict, sailing to the Mediterranean to participate in the campaign over Syria . One MiG-29KR Fulcrum , as well as a Su-33 Flanker , from its air wing were lost in the process due to accidents. The carrier arrived in Murmansk for refit in early 2017, being buzzed en route by British Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets. Soon after its arrival at the shipyard, and as The War Zone reported, there were indications that the scope of the work was being dramatically reduced, throwing the fate of the warship into question. Nevertheless, the carrier was expected to receive upgrades to its powerplant and electronics equipment that would extend its service life by another 25 years. However, the project has run anything but smoothly since then. A floating dry dock containing the ship sank in October 2018 , resulting in a crane smashing into the warship’s deck and causing significant damage . Then, in December 2019, a serious fire broke out on board the vessel, which you can read about here . The refit for the Admiral Kuznetsov had originally been anticipated for completion in 2021, but, as of last December, a source quoted in a report from Russia’s state-run TASS news agency said the vessel was due to return to sea for trials in 2022. It could very well be that work has been stalled ever since the loss of the dry dock, which was Russia’s largest and the only one big enough to accommodate the carrier. The state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation, or USC, admitted back in September 2018 that it was looking into alternatives for servicing the flattop, but that those substitutes could be months, if not years away from becoming operational. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lana Sator (@lanasator) Still, there has been no official indication that work on returning the Admiral Kuznetsov to service has been abandoned entirely. It is nonetheless interesting to note that the new Project 23900 amphibious assault ships now being built for the Russian Navy will reportedly displace around 44,000 tons, according to a senior defense ministry official. In comparison, the standard displacement for the Admiral Kuznetsov is around 52,000 tons . Confirmation of the Project 23900 class’s increase in size was provided by Russia’s Deputy Minister of Defense Alexei Krivoruchko, in a recent interview with Krasnaya Zvezda , the Russian military’s official news outlet, which is also known as the Central Organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense. An official computer-generated artwork showing the Project 23900 ship, prior to its most recently reported increase in size., Russian Ministry of Defense “Under the leadership of the President of the Russian Federation [Vladimir Putin], two universal landing ships have been laid down of a new design, displacement 40,000 [metric] tonnes each,” Krivoruchko said. “Under current conditions for ensuring the pace of equipping the Russian Navy, implementation of a series of contracts is being carried out with the use of a mechanism for advance financing, in order to ensure delivery of the ships one to three years than the previously planned delivery time.” As recently as last August, TASS was reporting that the two ships would displace at least 33,000 tons each. This figure was provided by an unnamed source in the shipbuilding industry. Before that, the vessels were expected to displace around 28,000 tons each, according to that same story. While still smaller than the Admiral Kuznetsov , a figure of 44,000 tons would put the new amphibious assault ships firmly in the same category as the U.S. Navy’s Wasp class , which are capable of operating short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter jets, but are not equipped for conventional carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft. Russia, of course, has no STOVL jets in its inventory, and its fleet of helicopters dedicated to amphibious operations is only very modest. Back in 2017, Deputy Defense Minister Yury Borisov revealed that the Kremlin was in talks with the country’s aviation industry about a new STOVL fighter design , although there appears to have been little or no news of that program since and in the current acquisition environment it would seem a very unlikely candidate for funding. The U.S. Navy’s first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS Wasp in the Philippines carrying a U.S. Marine Corps contingent that includes at least 10 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters ., U.S. Navy Moreover, the new displacement would exceed that of the French Navy’s sole nuclear-powered carrier Charles de Gaulle , which has a displacement of around 42,000 tons fully loaded. The Charles de Gaulle is equipped with catapults and arrestor gear to operate conventional fixed-wing aircraft, including Rafale M fighter jets , while the conventionally powered Admiral Kuznetsov is not fitted with steam catapults and instead uses a ‘ski-jump’ ramp over the bow for launching its fixed-wing aircraft . Current reports suggest the Project 23900 ships will have a greater displacement than the Charles de Gaulle — the only catapult-equipped aircraft carrier currently active outside the U.S. Navy., U.S. Navy As yet, there appears to be no sign that the Project 23900 vessels are in any way planned to operate conventional fixed-wing aircraft, such as the MiG-29K and Su-33 that are included in the standard air wing of the Admiral Kuznetsov . Furthermore, it is as yet unclear how the planned increase in size will affect the overall design and capabilities of the Project 23900 class and whether it could potentially translate into a much larger flight deck. Equipping such a vessel with a takeoff ramp or catapults, plus angled deck would be a huge undertaking and the two ships are far more likely to be limited to the currently declared rotary-wing and drone types. Previously, the design was reported as being around 720 feet long, compared to 860 feet for the Charles de Gaulle , and 1,000 feet for the Admiral Kuznetsov , but this was before the planned increase in displacement. There is also the lingering possibility that Russia might indeed develop a new STOVL fighter , but that would be an enormously expensive undertaking in order to equip just two assault ships. These two vessels are intended to replace a pair of Mistral class amphibious assault ships that were to be built for Russia by a French consortium, their purchase being approved in 2010. However, this contract was suspended following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, and the two ships were eventually sold to Egypt , instead. The Mistral class vessels have a displacement of around 23,700 tons, considerably smaller than what is now planned for their successors. One of two Mistral class ships under construction for the Russian Navy in 2014., LUDOVIC PÉRON VIA WIKIMEDIA A contract for the construction of the two Project 23900 warships was signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense in May 2020, valued at around $1.36 billion, with work taking place at the Zaliv shipyard in Kerch, a facility that has been in Russian hands since it took over Crimea. That is a tiny amount of money for two amphibious assault ships of this size, but it could be just part of the acquisition cost. More so, it is very unlikely to include the vast array of mission systems these vessels would also require. An early model of the Project 23900 amphibious assault ship, with Helix and Hokum helicopters arranged on deck., ARTEM TKACHENKO/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Both ships were laid down at Zaliv last June and have been named Ivan Rogov and Mitrofan Moskalenko . Russian media reports suggest that the ships are due to be handed over in 2025 and 2027. Last summer, when the projected displacement was still 33,000 tons, the design of the vessels was reported as being able to carry 16 “heavy” helicopters, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this instance, it seems “heavy” refers not to a true heavyweight rotorcraft like the enormous Mi-26 Halo , used by the Russian Aerospace Forces, but to rotorcraft in the class of the Ka-29 Helix assault helicopter. This would also include the related Ka-31 airborne early warning and Ka-27 anti-submarine warfare/utility versions that have been routinely embarked on Soviet or Russian Navy warships in the past. The Ka-29 is the primary amphibious assault helicopter in Russian Navy service, but only around a dozen are in use. , DMITRY RYAZANOV/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Other helicopters envisaged for the Project 23900 include the Ka-52K Katran, meaning spiny dogfish in Russian, a navalized version of the Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter, which has already undergone ship trials aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov . In addition to folding rotor blades and other features for shipboard operations, the Katran can carry the Kh-35 (AS-20 Kayak) subsonic anti-ship missile. In its land-based form, the Ka-52 has also been operated aboard the Egyptian Navy’s Mistral class amphibious assault ships. Other non-marinized helicopters could also use the ships during temporary taskings. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oAWS7ndPazE The types of drones to be embarked has not been revealed either, but a rotary-wing type is one option. In 2018, Russia revealed a rotary-wing UAV, confusingly also named Katran, during the Victory Day Parade in Moscow. In terms of concept and capabilities, this drone appears to be similar to the Schiebel Camcopter S-100 , an Austrian-made rotary-wing UAV that has been used aboard the French Navy’s Mistral class assault ships, and many other naval vessels. Smaller unmanned fixed-wing aircraft could potentially be embarked on these ships, with a wider array possible if a light catapult were installed and some form of arresting recovery systems. This is not for manned fighters, or anything similar, but for smaller drones that can expand the sensor reach of the ship and more. Even aside from the problems that have befallen the Admiral Kuznetsov in the recent past, there is an argument to be made that two modern amphibious assault ships represent a much better use of resources than the single aircraft carrier, which is necessarily limited by its short takeoff but arrested recovery (STOBAR) flight operations. Without a catapult to launch its aircraft, its aircraft can only operate with a reduced payload of weapons and/or fuel, which was likely the reason that the jets disembarked from the ship during the Syrian campaign to fly from Russia’s land base at Khmeimim in Latakia province. You can read more about the land-based interlude for the Russian carrier air wing in this previous article. Also, operating only a single aircraft carrier significantly reduces availability to the periods when it is not in regular refit. For much of the time that it’s at sea, the carrier’s crew and embarked air wing will be engaged in routine training cycles, further limiting its ability to deploy on operations as and when required. The less-than-stellar showing by the Admiral Kuznetsov during its sole combat cruise in the Mediterranean, where the carrier’s value was arguably largely symbolic — and which included the embarrassment of having to retrieve two fighter jets from the seafloor — may also have contributed to some disenchantment among the navy, and perhaps the wider Russian defense establishment. Furthermore, the cost of operating a dedicated carrier aviation arm dominated by fighter jets, with various types unique to that service, is formidable, and eliminating it would free up a lot of funding. Russia’s financial situation alone could be enough to see the Admiral Kuznetsov , and its niche air wing scrapped. Ultimately, an amphibious assault ship is potentially much more flexible, even without conventional fixed-wing airpower. The Project 23900 is expected to be able to embark six landing craft to transport around 75 armored vehicles, 900 troops, and support equipment to a beachhead during an amphibious operation, but the vessels would also be suitable for floating hospitals or as flagships for littoral operations. With some modifications, or with a tailored air group onboard, these warships could also take on anti-submarine or mine warfare roles. In addition, time and again, amphibious vessels of this kind have also shown their worth in non-combat scenarios, including disaster relief and humanitarian assistance missions. A Russian beach-landing exercise in 2016. The Project 23900s would provide a much more capable and survivable amphibious assault capability., YouTube Screencap Russia’s experience in the annexation of Crimea may well have helped inform the ongoing design changes for the assault ships. It’s also likely that they will have a role in the kinds of Arctic operations that the Russian military is also increasingly focusing on . Speaking to TASS last August, Renat Mistakhov, the head of the Ak Bars Shipbuilding Corporation that is the parent company of the Zaliv shipyard, said that, unlike the French-made Mistral ships, the Project 23900s would be capable of operating in the Arctic, “being led by an icebreaker.” That said, the Project 23900 design would also have still relevance in a campaign like that in Syria , for example, its helicopters delivering special operations forces ashore, flying combat search and rescue missions, prosecuting anti-submarine or anti-shipping patrols, or even undertaking airstrikes in the vicinity of the shore. In the meantime, it seems there is currently no appetite for a direct successor to the Admiral Kuznetsov , with reports back in 2017 indicating that planned work on new classes of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and destroyers for the Russian Navy had been put on hold indefinitely , in favor of more urgent or important defense programs . Overall, if properly funded, Russia’s new amphibious assault ships will provide a more valuable complement to its maritime capabilities long-term than the Cold War-design aircraft carrier. Whatever their final size and aviation component, they will offer superior versatility across a wider set of missions. Moreover, doing away with fixed-wing carrier aircraft would also allow funds to be invested in realizing the full potential of these two new warships.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 22, 2020",Iran Films One Of America’s Most Powerful Submarines Lurking Near Its Military Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A video has emerged that reportedly shows an Iranian Navy Sea King helicopter flying over what looks to be a U.S. Navy Ohio class guided-missile submarine sailing a periscope depth somewhere in the North Arabian Sea This very likely the USS Georgia , which made an unusually public transit into the Persian Gulf, sending a clear signal to Iran, last month. The Iranian Navy claims that the American submarine was operating close to where it has been conducting a major exercise this week and that it left after being detected. It’s extremely rare to see U.S. Navy submarines sailing so close to the surface like this anywhere in the world, let alone in any sort of proximity to potential hostile forces. Iran’s Navy says that the encounter took place today and that the submarine looked to be heading toward the area where it has been holding its Eqtedar exercise at the time. This two-day drill, the name of which means power in Farsi, started yesterday, Jan. 13, 2021, and has reportedly involved a significant display of the country’s naval capabilities, including the first-ever instance of its lone Fateh class submarine firing a torpedo . The Iranian Navy’s new sea base-type ship, the Markran , which was only formally commissioned earlier this week and that you can read about more in this War Zone piece , as well as a recently delivered Sina class missile-armed fast attack craft are also taking part. A screengrab from a video reportedly taken from an Iranian Navy helicopter fly over the North Arabian Sea that appears to show an Ohio class guided-missile submarine at periscope depth., Darya Press capture The Iranian Navy did not identify the American submarine, but the video that subsequently appeared online shows a submarine matching the size and shape of an Ohio class boat. A dry deck shelter , used to deploy special operations forces , as well as the mini-submarines they can use to transit longer distances to their objectives and other over-sized payloads , is visible mounted on the hull behind the sail. This is a feature found on the four Ohios that were converted into guided-missile submarines, or SSGNs, including USS Georgia , though a number of Virginia class submarines are also fitted with them. The Ohio class SSGNs multi-mission boats, which you can read about in more detail in this past War Zone feature , are among the most capable and in-demand submarines in the U.S. Navy today. The video also shows the crew of the Iranian Navy Sea King attempting to contact the submarine and warning it not to enter the exercise area. The boat reportedly left the area afterward, with some Iranian outlets implying that it was forced to leave after being detected. When asked for a statement in response to the Iranian claims, as well as the video, U.S. Naval Forces Central, which oversees U.S. naval operations in and around the Middle East, to include the North Arabian Sea, told The War Zone that, as a general rule, it does not discuss submarine operations. This is, of course, in contrast to the USS Georgia ‘s transit through the strategic Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf last in December 2020, which the U.S. Navy actively highlighted , including releasing the video seen below. The new Iranian video would indicate that the boat left the Persian Gulf with no such fanfare. Regardless, it would not be at all surprising that USS Georgia would be keeping an eye on the Eqtedar drill. The primary focus when talking about the Ohio class SSGNs is often on their ability to carry up to 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and special operations forces units. However, they typically only have around 100 Tomahawks – still a significant loadout – onboard at any one time and empty missile tubes, as well as other spaces within the hull, are filled with other highly specialized equipment, including various unmanned platforms and the necessary systems to launch them while underwater. The boats are otherwise outfitted to operate as discreet underwater intelligence fusion nodes and command centers. This all makes them some of the best intelligence-gathering platforms available to the U.S. Navy. Based on Iranian news reports, the exercise presents a potential intelligence bonanza, including a chance to collect information about the country’s Fateh class submarine and its capabilities, as highlighted by this being the first instance it is known to have successfully fired a torpedo. This Iranian submarine officially entered service last year and is the largest boat that the country has at present. Iran has also said that it will eventually be capable of firing submarine-launched anti-ship missiles . There would no doubt be a general desire to get any additional details about the Markran , which is the second sea base-type ship to enter Iranian service in the past three months, as well. The Eqtedar exercise has also involved the employment of an array of existing surface and shore-launched anti-ship missiles and unmanned aircraft, as well as various other Iranian Navy warships, additional information about which would still have clear intelligence value. The entire exercise area would have been full of electronic emissions, from radars, communications systems, and more that would also be of interest to U.S. intelligence analysts. Any intercepted communications chatter might provide new insights into Iranian tactics, techniques, and procedures, too. No matter what, the exercise also comes at a time where there continues to be significant concerns within the U.S. government that Iran might be planning to attack U.S. interests, either directly or via proxies, in the region or elsewhere . The first anniversary of the U.S. military’s killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020 came and went without incident, but Iranian officials made pointed threats toward the United States, including ones aimed at President Donald Trump, specifically. In response, Trump directed the Pentagon to send the supercarrier USS Nimitz and its associated strike group, which had been on their way home, back to the Middle East as a deterrent. USS Georgia ‘s very presence in the region, together with numerous long-range sorties by U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers, were also seen as sending similar messages to the regime in Tehran ahead of the anniversary of Soleimani’s death. There have been reports that the U.S. intelligence community has seen notable upticks in Iranian military activity, but it has remained unclear if that might be in preparation for an attack, or U.S. relational to one, or if it a response to threats from the United States, real or perceived. Sending Georgia to discreetly observe this major Iranian naval exercise could help provide additional context for any future assessments about the posture of Iran’s military forces. It’s also worth remembering that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized a South Korean-flagged tanker earlier this month. This prompted the South Korean military to increase its activities in and around the Strait of Hormuz and otherwise increasing tensions in the region. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rDrUn8GCOsk Georgia ‘s appearance near the exercise, close to the surface and during the day, put it in a very vulnerable position and one where it was very likely from the beginning that it would be detected visually by Iranian forces operating in the area. This would have had to have been a deliberate decision on the part of the boat’s commanding officer. This raises the question of whether this was itself another signal to Iran, which could add another facet to the geopolitical friction between Washington and Tehran at the moment. There have been reports that President Trump might be considering some kind of military action against Iran, including on facilities related to its controversial nuclear program . Iranian authorities recently announced that they had begun enriching uranium to levels prohibited under an international agreement, which the U.S. government had been party to, but withdrew from in 2018 . This could potentially put Iran closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon, should it decide to do so. All told, the brief cat-and-mouse game between the Iranian Navy and its American counterpart today in the North Arabian Sea underscores how close the two are operating to each other and the bold activities the U.S. Navy is asking of its usually invisible submarine forces in the region.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 20, 2020",Declassified Document Outlines Trump Administration’s Secret Pacific Strategy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has just declassified a critical national security document, the 2018 Indo-Pacific strategy, which, for the last three years, has provided the template for U.S. policy in this strategically vital region, spanning from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India. In particular, the strategy outlines ways to counter Beijing’s burgeoning influence in the Indo-Pacific, plans to deal with an increasingly bellicose North Korea, as well as the importance of strengthening India as a military counterbalance to China. The strategy document was drawn up by the National Security Council (NSC) over the course of 2017, before being approved by President Donald Trump in early 2018, soon after the release of the National Defense Strategy, which you can read more about here . Previously classified as secret and not intended to be publicly releasable in any form before the very last day of 2042, the report was made available online late on January 12, with only minor redactions. Exactly why it was released now has not been clarified. Indian, Japanese, and American carriers sail side-by-side during Malabar 2017 excercise. , USN While the exact authors are unknown and the document was the product of a multi-agency effort, H.R. McMaster, then Trump’s National Security Advisor, and Matt Pottinger, the NSC director for Asia at the time, and subsequently Deputy National Security Advisor, would have been among those involved. McMaster resigned from this post in March 2018. Pottinger was one of the officials to resign last week, following the storming of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. by pro-Trump supporters. You can read more about that dramatic episode here . Although much of the document is clearly in line with what has already been seen of the Trump Administration’s actions in the Indo-Pacific in the past three years, it nonetheless provides a useful crystallization of U.S. interests in the region, as evidenced by the following passage: NSC Beyond that, is it worth looking in more detail at the most pertinent points of the document, in particular how the United States views its key adversaries and partners in the region, particularly China, North Korea, and India. The main threat: China As one of the most dominant powers in the Indo-Pacific, and one increasingly identified by the U.S. government as its chief opponent and strategic challenger in the region , it is not surprising that China is identified as the U.S. government’s primary concern. There is certainly no end in sight for the strategic rivalry between the two countries whose political and economic systems are so at odds. The document sets out the key national security challenges for the United States in the region, including “How to maintain U.S. strategic primacy […] and promote a liberal economic order while preventing China from establishing new, illiberal spheres of influence, and cultivating areas of cooperation to promote regional peace and prosperity.” It also provides a warning that “China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage” when it comes to the strategic competition between the two powers. There is little mention of the specific military strategies that China is using to assert its regional dominance, but there is an explicit reference to Beijing’s “proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations [that] will damage U.S. efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region and, increasingly, in the Western hemisphere and at home.” Separately, the U.S. government has publicly identified matters of military concern in regards to China, especially its growing nuclear arsenal , long-range ballistic and cruise missile capabilities, and naval capacity , among others. An official video from the Chinese Ministry of Defense from last year depicting a hypothetical attack on the U.S. airbase on Guam: https://youtube.com/watch?v=fj1wCjIitIU The document does provide an overview of a broader defense strategy aimed toward China and which specifies a posture that is “capable of, but not limited to: (1) denying China sustained air and sea dominance inside the “first island chain” in a conflict; (2) defending the first-island-chain nations, including Taiwan; and (3) dominating all domains outside the first island chain.” The first island chain refers to the major archipelagos nearest the east Asian mainland, stretching from Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula to the Malay peninsula and including the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, and the northern Philippines. Much of the waters within this approximate boundary are contested and claimed by China, which meanwhile possesses a capable and fast-expanding navy. Not mentioned specifically in the document, but surely in the minds of the authors, are China’s expansive and almost universally disputed territorial claims, particularly in the South China Sea , but also in other parts of the broader Western Pacific . The South China Sea and adjacent bodies of water have seen a notable increase in Chinese military activity , but also in activities by the United States and its regional allies and partners. Last year , for the first time since 2014, the U.S. Navy had two Nimitz class aircraft carriers and elements of their respective strike groups operating together in the South China Sea. , U.S. Navy In practical terms, the U.S. relationship with China has steadily deteriorated under the Trump administration, including an ongoing trade war targeting Chinese companies considered to be a threat to national security, while on the military side, the United States has not only been proactive in demonstrating its ability to protect allies and interests in the region from Chinese aggression but has also committed itself to the defense of Taiwan , evidenced by a number of big-ticket defense deals with the island nation. There have also been attempts made by Trump to blame China for the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing its government of not having managed the first outbreak adequately. Meanwhile, under Trump, the relationship between the United States and Taiwan has expanded beyond just arms sales , to include training and increased diplomatic engagement . Tackling a nuclear North Korea After China, the 2018 strategy framework identifies the next biggest threat in the Indo-Pacific is North Korea. This document’s viewpoint and language would have been directly influenced by the various provocative missile tests that took place in 2017, which also demonstrated the rapid advances Pyongyang had made with regards to various types of military technology. The document notes that North Korea’s “nuclear missiles and its stated intention of subjugating South Korea pose a grave threat to the U.S. homeland and our allies.” It is worth noting that the Trump Administration, and Trump personally, had already been pursuing an extremely aggressive policy toward North Korea in 2017 — before the document was actually approved. This even extended to threats implying the use of nuclear weapons . This strategy was developed as U.S. policy was shifting to detente in the lead up to the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un , as well as the softening of the relationship between North Korea and South Korea. A new type of North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile during a military parade last October ., NK Korean State News The 2018 document identifies the roles that both Japan and South Korea can play in helping the U.S. attain its objectives vis-à-vis North Korea, which include removing not only nuclear weapons, but also chemical, cyber, and biological weapons from the Korean peninsula. To help facilitate this, it calls for the United States to assist South Korea and Japan in acquiring “advanced, conventional military capabilities” and to draw South Korea and Japan closer together. Although, at least in redacted form, it does not provide clues as to how the latter would be achieved The key objective in the United States dealings with North Korea is to “Convince the Kim regime that the only path to its survival is to relinquish its nuclear weapons” and a whole raft of tools are highlighted as a means of achieving this, including applying pressure by economic, diplomatic, military, law enforcement, and intelligence, and information means. Negotiations are listed as an option if and when North Korea takes steps to reverse its nuclear and missile programs. While the Trump administration did follow through with direct talks with Kim Jong Un, the outcomes turned out to be, largely, failures . Against the backdrop of this, the relationship between Trump and Kim apparently evolved into something of an infatuation on the part of Trump, too. It is notable that Bill Burns, President-elect Biden’s choice for the next head of the Central Intelligence Agency, has talked about this specific point recently and its clear pitfalls. India as a vital strategic partner The strategy overall promotes strategic alignment with allies and partners in the region, including the desire to “to create a quadrilateral security framework with India, Japan, Australia, and the United States as the principal hubs.” However, India in particular is identified as a key regional partner and as a potential bulwark to offset Beijing’s power and influence. “A strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China,” the document states. It also notes that “India maintains the capacity to counter border provocations by China,” although the document pre-dates the latest round of skirmishes between China and India in Ladakh and the Tibet Autonomous Region, where the enduring military standoff between the countries escalated significantly last year. The strategy document came out before the India-Pakistan conflict in 2019 and actually makes no mention of Pakistan at all, despite Pakistan’s very close and significant ties to China and China’s aggressive efforts to redefine the status quo along its border with India. The document calls for efforts to “Accelerate India’s rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security and Major Defense Partner; solidify an enduring strategic partnership with India underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the United States and our partners in the region to address shared interests.” The Indian Navy aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and the guided-missile destroyer USS Sterett perform a farewell steam pass to conclude the Malabar 2020 maneuvers in the Indian Ocean. , U.S. Navy photo/Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Keenan Daniels Ultimately, however, as international security expert Ankit Panda has pointed out , the broader aspects of the role played by India within the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is a continuation of that contained in policy dating back to the second Bush administration. In concrete terms, under the Trump administration, the U.S. Navy has looked at establishing a new naval command with a particular focus on the Indian Ocean and adjacent areas of the Pacific. It has also been engaged in a cycle of large-scale maritime exercises involving the Indian Navy, as well as those from Japan and Australia, in the region. The U.S. military, as a whole, has also been working to strengthen ties with its Indian counterparts in this general region, in order to challenge China’s growing geopolitical ambitions. The U.S. has also begun to look at options for fielding longer-range strike capabilities in Asia as a direct counter to Beijing’s own missile forces. Meanwhile, significant arms sales, and big-ticket pitches , to New Delhi have continued apace and Lockheed Martin, for example, rebranded its latest advanced F-16 offering for India as the F-21 as it seeks to expand industrial cooperation in India. Some observers have even suggested that this might even pave the way for India to join the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Has it worked? Overall, despite the bold outlining of strategy in the Indo-Pacific, a good deal of the document’s aims remain unachieved, notably managing China’s growing power and influence. Communist China seems as ascendant as ever and is continuing to pursue very hardline policies in places like Xinjiang against the Uighurs and political dissidents in Hong Kong, with relative impunity. Tellingly, there is no mention made in the document of human rights abuses by Beijing. Similarly, attempts to remove nuclear weapons from North Korea have been a total failure. North Korea’s nuclear arsenal has reportedly grown and there are new rumblings of potential North Korean missile or nuclear tests in the coming year to challenge both the United States and South Korea. On the other hand, progress has been made, too. The aforementioned new numbered U.S. Navy fleet is due to be created to cover the Western Pacific, freedom of navigation drills have increased in frequency, and serious efforts have been made to empower and rearm Taiwan . Multi-national military exercises with key allies in the region have also continued to grow in scope and inclusivity. It is probably still too early to tell what the exact legacy of the Trump administration’s policies will be, in the end. Furthermore, we also don’t know how much of this general strategy will or won’t be carried over to the Biden administration. Regardless of these uncertainties, the strategy document provides an interesting view of how the Trump administration has been tackling issues in what is one of the most important and volatile regions on the planet.

Jamie Hunter,"Posted on Dec 23, 2019",Black Flag Rises: New “Super Bowl Of Test Exercises” Pushes USAF’s Top Weapons To Their Limit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Black Flag is a brand new, large-scale, test and evaluation exercise that the U.S. Air Force is betting big on. It forms a central pillar in transforming the way it gets new capabilities into the hands of frontline squadrons as quickly as possible. The War Zone was granted an exclusive interview with the leadership of the 53rd Wing , which is the organization responsible for overseeing this potentially revolutionary new exercise. In our discussion, we came to understand how the USAF will stress test and fully evaluate some of its most advanced technologies and new tactics in a secluded and highly demanding testing scenario that is far more akin to a high-end peer-state air war than a sterilized developmental environment. Established as a counterpart to the famous Red Flag training and readiness exercise at Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada, Black Flag is a test-driven derivative that is all about pushing the envelope of the latest equipment in similarly realistic and operationally-relevant scenarios. In December, Air Combat Command (ACC) chief General Mark D. Kelly formalized the 53rd Wing’s Large Force Test Events (LFTEs) as Black Flags. Now, this series of events will help to ensure ACC’s latest developments are ready to be plunged into the harshest of combat scenarios. A KC-135R refuels F-22As and F-16Cs during an LFTE in 2020., USAF The need for Black Flag Headquartered at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, the 53rd Wing is the operational test arm for pretty much everything inside ACC and much of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). It is therefore responsible for a multitude of critically important assets that are based at several different locations across the United States. Seamless integration between these assets is vital to ensure the maximum combined effect in combat. “Our job is to ensure to the maximum extent possible that we have really wrung out capabilities [in each aircraft], the tactics, and of course the procedures that we give to the operators so that on night one there’s no lesson to be learned other than us completely dominating in the space we operate in during the 21st century,” explains Colonel Ryan “Schmitt” Messer, commander of the 53rd Wing. According to COMACC (Commander ACC) Plan 21, Black Flag “will enable the Combat Air Force [CAF] to 1) innovate through deep-end test integration to discover new capabilities and synergies of fighter, bomber, ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance], and classified programs that create multiple dilemmas for the adversary, 2) satisfy AFI/AFMAN [Air Force Instruction/Air Force Manual] testing mandates, 3) add relevancy and accountability to ACC Weapons and Tactics Conference (WEPTAC), 4) foster a culture of Test Like We Fight that compliments Train Like We Fight, and 5) produce strategic impacts for Joint All-Domain Operations [JADO] and the NDS [National Defense Strategy].” An “OT” (Operational Test) Block 52 Viper in full burner over the Nevada Test and Training Range. , USAF ACC’s annual Weapons and Tactics Conference (WEPTAC) is a key driver for critical Tactics Improvement Proposals (TIPs) that are designed to make significant differences to the way squadrons approach their operations. TIPs are not about introducing new hardware or software on their own, they are more about using what is already available to its maximum potential and ensuring that everything will work in a combat environment when many other assets work alongside each other, including new and cutting-edge ones. These TIPs are a huge part of the thinking behind Black Flag, with the event being part of a new approach to get valuable new tactics to squadrons much faster. The Black Flag concept is not totally new — the operational test (OT) community has long been tasked with evaluating platforms and systems in a realistic, mass-force environment. “While the Black Flag concept itself was not new, the way we approached it was different,” explains Col Messer. “We wanted to create a venue by which we could create an integrated method and event where we could actually test the way that we plan to fight. Testing a specific weapons system or integrating just fighter aircraft together but not including all the other entities, although good, falls well short of what is required on night one,” says Messer. The 53rd Wing proved the effectiveness of the Black Flag concept through recent LFTEs in August and November 2020. “When it came to branding, LFTE doesn’t really roll off the tongue very well, and we knew we needed to make this a Flag-level event. This reflects the amount of resourcing that’s required, the level of integration, the number of aircraft, which is of the same order of magnitude as a Red Flag . The idea of a Flag-level event for operational testing dates back to the mid-2000s and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and that was originally going to be named Black Flag. So we are in fact building on the legacy of those who previously tried to get this approved.” Aircraft gather at the End Of Runway (EOR) during a large Red Flag mission launch., Jamie Hunter “ Red Flag was designed to get folks into combat so that they can survive their first several missions. Black Flag provides an environment for integrated test with the maximum amount of participation available from not only the USAF, but also as it expands from our joint test partners where we are fully testing not only the materiel, but also the non-materiel solutions in the highest-threat environment so our warfighters are as prepared as possible.” A higher echelon of flight-test “Black Flag is ultimately a deep-end testing arena to create and discover capabilities utilizing existing and emerging materiel,” says Lt Col Mike “Pako” Benitez, the 53rd Wing’s Director of Staff and lead project officer for the new exercise. Black Flag sits in a triad of new test-focused Large Force Exercises, or LFEs. “We call it the test Flag enterprise,” explains Lt Col Benitez. “These are Black, Orange, and Emerald Flags. Orange Flag has been around since 2017 and is run out of Edwards AFB , California, and is dedicated to developmental tests with “blue patch” test pilots working together in large force scenarios. Emerald Flag started in December and is run out of Eglin and it combines developmental and operational testing, and that is multi-domain and a playground for other systems from the likes of DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency], and experimentation from contractors.” Black Flag can either stand alone or work in conjunction with its other test Flag counterparts. F-16s and F-35s at Edwards AFB taking part in an Orange Flag exercise., Lockheed Martin/Darin Russell New programs have a rigorous set of tests and evaluations that they must complete in order to qualify for delivery to the front line. “To use an American football analogy, what we do on a day-to-day basis at the 53rd Wing’s individual units is the basic blocking and tackling for individual MDS [Mission Design Series, aircraft] of wringing out the systems and the associated tactics for that particular weapon system to either fix or upgrade,” explains Col Messer. “We then scrimmage in a Black Banner, Skull War, or Bat War, which are localized events where we bring entities within the wing together — that’s where we start to do a little more integration. Black Flag is like the Super Bowl.” “We have discovered that we often think we know everything about individual platforms and that new things are ready to go. But when we integrate into an LFTE we discover new things — issues we didn’t know existed because we hadn’t integrated with another platform until that point. So, a Black Flag allows us to really flex our muscles and include deep data-driven analysis to judge how we performed. This is extremely informative for our senior leaders. We can clearly show them what we did, what we learned, and back it all up with data and analysis that can then inform plans for the future.” Black Flag is primarily run on the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), which is adjacent to Nellis AFB. It offers the chance to plug into the incredible diversity of assets that are based here, as well as the full suite of Foreign Materiel Exploitation (FME) assets (foreign weapons) available in the NTTR. However, some joint events with Orange Flag, for example, have been flown in the R-2508 range complex near Edwards. A B-2 Spirit gets airborne from Nellis AFB., Jamie Hunter Working for TIPs “The 2020 LFTEs were about getting after the Tactics Improvement Proposals [TIPs] pushed out by senior leaders after WEPTAC. In the August event we primarily looked at how we help low-observable [LO] assets like the B-2 Spirit ingress and execute a deep strike on an adversary target,” says Major Theodore “CINC” Ellis, the 53rd Wing Weapons Officer, as he explains details of the two publicized LFTEs of 2020. Significantly, this event also teamed the B-2 and F-35 with the RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone from the service’s top-secret 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, which The War Zone was first to report on in detail . “The November event focused on Destructive of Enemy Air Defense [DEAD], how we sustain air dominance from a ground perspective to make sure all of our aircraft, including types such as tankers, have the security to make sure we can go in, knock down doors and be successful.” Ellis notes that this event included an EC-130H Compass Call as well as a pair of F-15E Strike Eagles upgraded with the new Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System ( EPAWSS ). “This system is still in the developmental phase, but it’s fairly mature. F-15E aircrews from the 53rd Wing that flew in the LFTE with EPAWSS were really impressed with how well it’s doing. They were actually able to use some of the electromagnetic features it has for geolocation as well as some electronic attack during the LFTE missions. This is a great example of Development Test working with emerging tactics, using a high-density, high-threat environment to really stress the system. This event had all kinds of threats online.” An F-15E upgraded with EPAWSS takes on fuel from a KC-46 during November 2020’s LFTE., USAF/53rd Wing “We conducted one additional [LFTE] event in the September-October timeframe in conjunction with Orange Flag 20-2,” Ellis adds. “That was primarily focused on U.S. Joint and Coalition partnerships to ensure our systems worked together. We let the DT guys gather their data, then the following week we had a Black Flag look on it. We were supposed to have Australian F-35s with us, but they could not participate because of COVID travel restrictions. But it underlines how the test Flags are designed to work in a joint or coalition environment.” Delivering on WEPTAC Held annually in January at Nellis and hosted by the resident Air Force Warfare Center, WEPTAC is a two-week conference led by ACC that is designed as a forum to discuss TIPs — a set of non-materiel solutions that will be focused on over the following year. It’s where senior leaders have a chance to hear from those on the front line about critical issues. “Broadly, the first week is geared towards working group development and the second is when senior leaders out-brief on what the groups have been working on,” says Messer. “It’s a chance to look at hard problems that folks are facing in the various combatant commands and bring some of the best minds together to try and come up with how solutions might look. We don’t always arrive at a fix, but we will decide on potential courses of action to test and develop.” “Some of the main challenges we faced with WEPTAC was that we had lots of different suggestions that were very aircraft-type focused and not fully integrated. More importantly, it wasn’t resourced properly. Each year when we discussed the top 20 TIPs we should focus on, we would form a prioritized list, but it wasn’t resourced, which meant we couldn’t really get after it.” Gen Mike Holmes addresses WEPTAC 2018., USAF “The big change for the 2020 event was that we bought a new team to WEPTAC. Our resource and test management folks looked at the TIPs to put a price tag on what each would most likely cost. It meant that our top 15 TIPs that were agreed by the four-star generals were actually resourced by ACC and the other MAJCOMs [Major Commands]. Despite the impact of COVID, we have been able to execute 12 of those 15 TIPs during 2020. That’s phenomenal in any year.” The 2020 TIP list included fifth-generation fighter Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) support to maximize the effectiveness of B-2 Spirit operations, and B-2 low-observable ingress tactics, AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) integration between the B-1B and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16 cruise missile defense with the AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS), and F-35 fourth and fifth-generation, joint, and coalition SEAD. “The addition of Black Flag allows us to plan ahead of time. We now have established venues that we can plug these TIPs into, which means we don’t have to wait for resourcing before we can execute. All that deconfliction can be done ahead of time and it allows more long-term planning and thereby streamlines throughput of the TIPs,” Messer explains. Maj Ellis adds: “TIPs drive how I build the scenarios. We took the top 15 from WEPTAC in January 2020 and looked at ACC priorities and how we could get after those in an integrated environment, structuring it to be operationally relevant and tactically focused to test like we fight. The Weapons School here at Nellis is training-driven with specific desired learning objectives, and we can use Black Flag to ensure the latest WIC [Weapons Instructor Course] graduates — the most tactical guys and gals that we have — go back to their squadrons with the latest data.” Black Flag is an indicator of big changes Black Flag is part of the broad initiative to expedite the fielding of new equipment and tactics. “Historically, tactics development is a linear process that can take three to four years,” explains Lt Col Benitez. “This year, with these changes, we’ve been able to cut that down to about 15 months from concept to combat. As our software updates start hatching faster, we now have a venue that’s resourced so that we can develop multiple on-ramps for opportunities to test new software and how it applies to a weapons system, as well as how it can amplify the combat capability of an entire package.” This acceleration is forcing changes in the way the USAF documents and issues instructions to the CAF. “We hope that Black Flag will change the paradigm of how we write and update the “three-dash-one” [3-1] tactics manual,” says Lt Col Benitez. “As we move to rapid test and rapid integration with agile software in the aircraft and Black Flag uncovering new ways to use it, rewriting a paper manual every couple of years is going to lag behind the fight. We will be developing tactics faster than we can publish them, so the way that we publish them will have to change.” An F-35A from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron., USAF Black Flag has already been used to test and endorse specific elements of the tactics manual, as Maj Ellis adds. “In August we looked at specific F-35 data and an example that said with a four-ship of F-35s they needed to be in X formation to achieve Y effect. They had never actually gone out to test the limits in a full-up environment. Black Flag said: “Well, your 3-1 says this, let’s actually do it.” We looked at what are the actual limits. We tried different formations and evaluated if they needed to be that specific to make it work.” Looking at the schedule for 2021, Maj Ellis says: “The first Orange Flag and Black Banner combined event came about because our objectives align fairly well. We will be primarily looking at LO aircraft once again and how we can test counter-air tactics against them.” The diary calls for two Black Flag level events per year plus two “usually smaller” Black Banners, based on resourcing and scheduling. Meanwhile, the 53rd Wing is reorganizing some of its units to embrace the more agile approach to operational testing across its broad remit. It is combining its previously separate Test Evaluation Groups (TEGs) and Test Management Groups (TMGs). At Nellis, the 53rd TEG will focus on test management and execution for all fighter, remotely piloted aircraft, and rescue types that come under ACC. The 53rd Test Management Group at Eglin will become the 753rd TEG that is focused on AFGSC to cover the test and management of all bomber assets. This will include the 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron, which will focus on the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider program. An F-15E from the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron flying over the Nevada Test and Training Range., Jamie Hunter The coming months will also see further clear examples of how the 53rd Wing is moving to truly combined development and operational testing . “We plan to roll out the first F-15EX here at Eglin and then hope to be able to take the USAF’s brand new Eagle to Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in May for operational testing,” reveals Col Messer. Northern Edge is designed to replicate the most challenging Indo-Pacific theater scenarios, and pairs training with the ability to stress-test emerging capabilities. “That will be a brand-new asset that will immediately be taking part in a Large Force Exercise. This is planned to have a large test footprint that is inserted into an Indo-Pacific Command exercise, and we will fly in certain missions.” Northern Edge serves as a further example of how the 53rd Wing is going much further than just evaluating a specific type or piece of equipment in the constraints of its typical daily environment. Modern-day USAF operational tests are pushing the limits much further. It is looking at a far more diverse and integrated environment, whilst also accelerating the overall process. These moves are critical in keeping the USAF on the leading edge when it comes to the great power competition with China. Fielding new tactics and technologies in an increasingly agile manner, while also ensuring integrity and lethality, has become an absolutely necessary proposition. With all this in mind, from henceforth, Black Flag will provide an arena where the latest and greatest capabilities, both disclosed and classified, that the USAF’s combat forces have to offer will be put to the ultimate non-combat test.

Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jan 26, 2021",First Peacetime Terror Attack On The Air Force Destroyed Eight A-7 Attack Jets 40 Years Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On the early morning of January 12, 1981, 40 years ago today, 11 commandos from a Puerto Rican separatist organization broke through the perimeter fence at Muñiz Air National Guard Base on the island, armed with explosives. Their targets were aircraft from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. What followed was not only the most destructive single attack on U.S. military forces since the Vietnam War up to that date, but also the most significant material loss from any single act of terrorism against the U.S. Air Force anywhere in the world. The commandos were from the Boricua Popular Army, or Ejército Popular Boricua, also known as the “Macheteros” — machete wielders in Spanish — a clandestine organization looking to secure Puerto Rico’s independence from the United States. Located in the Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico has been an American unincorporated territory since the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898. While controlled by the U.S. Federal Government, it is essentially a colony. Its inhabitants are U.S. citizens, but can’t vote in presidential elections and have only one representative in Congress, who can’t vote on legislative matters. An A-7D of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard undergoes maintenance at Muñiz Air National Guard Base, Puerto Rico., U.S. Air Force The island has a number of military facilities, including, as of 1981, Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and Muñiz Air National Guard Base, the latter of which is located on the outskirts of San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital and co-located with the island’s international airport. The Boricua Popular Army’s attack on Muñiz Air National Guard Base was timed to coincide with the birthdate of Eugenio María de Hostos, a 19th-century Puerto Rican independence advocate. Using military uniforms to disguise themselves, the commandos breached the airbase perimeter fence — which was not electrified — by simply cutting through a chain-link fence. It’s unclear how they got to the ramp for the Air National Guard’s A-7 Corsair II attack aircraft, but contemporary reports suggest at least some of the “Macheteros” may have used a boat to navigate one of the many channels running around the facility, connecting various lagoons with the island’s Atlantic coast. Likely aided by insider information, or close surveillance, the infiltrators arrived on the airbase just as its security personnel was changing shifts. The various guards — both Air National Guard personnel and contracted civilians — were apparently unaware that trespassers were within the facility. The separatists were carrying explosives that had been stolen from a local explosives factory, all part of an operation that was apparently codenamed Operation Pitirre II. The pitirre is a bird, also known as the gray kingbird, which is native to Puerto Rico, among other islands in the Caribbean. Around 25 satchel charges were placed on 11 aircraft on the ramp, in their air intake ducts, or wheel wells. Each pack contained four sticks of Iremite, an explosive normally used for blasting in commercial mining. To ensure a 60-minute time delay, a simple but effective watch-and-battery setup was used to trigger the detonators. Then, the commandos left the same way that they had entered the airbase. The whole process had apparently taken less than eight minutes. A row of Puerto Rico Air National Guard A-7Ds, almost completely burnt out, on the ramp at Muñiz Air National Guard Base., PUBLIC DOMAIN The resulting explosions at Muñiz Air National Guard Base damaged 10 A-7D aircraft out of a total of 18 at the base belonging to the 156th Tactical Fighter Group, as well as a single F-104C Starfighter. The latter type had previously been in service with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and this particular example was earmarked to be preserved as a static display. Eight of the A-7Ds were written off entirely, two more damaged, and the value of the total material loss was put at around $45 million. Bombs on two other A-7Ds did not detonate and were later dismantled by U.S. Navy explosives technicians . A Puerto Rico Air National Guard pilot aboard an A-7D During Exercise Ocean Venture in 1982. , NATIONAL ARCHIVES An A-7D from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard during Exercise Bold Eagle, a year after the attack on the base., NATIONAL ARCHIVES Never before had an Air Force facility on U.S. soil come under terrorist attack, nor had terrorists previously destroyed Air Force aircraft in peacetime. A day after the attack, the Boricua Popular Army claimed responsibility, issuing a statement denouncing the U.S. Air Force for “invading our homeland” and “[exposing] our people to nuclear extermination,” and also pointing to “revolutionary solidarity with the brotherly people of El Salvador and their revolutionary organizations.” The communique also named four individuals whose deaths the organization blamed on the U.S. regime, including two pro-independence activists. At this time, guerrillas in El Salvador were waging their own, far more violent conflict against the U.S.-backed military government of that country, which was, at the time, notorious for its use of paramilitary death squads . Combatants from the leftist People’s Revolutionary Army in El Salvador were one of the causes for which the Boricua Popular Army claimed responsibility for the attack on Muñiz Air National Guard Base.  , Linda Hess Miller/Wikimedia Commons The initial fallout from the incident focused on how easily the perpetrators had entered and then left the base and the degree of damage that they had inflicted in such a short space of time. Not since the Vietnam War had a U.S. airbase sustained such a devastating attack. During the fighting in Southeast Asia, these types of raids had invariably been carried out by North Vietnamese forces, or at least highly trained and battle-hardened local Communist guerrillas, using purpose-made weapons. An RF-4C Phantom II destroyed during a Viet Cong rocket attack against Tan Son Nhut Air Base in February 1968., U.S. Air Force While the National Guard Bureau had apparently been aware of the insufficient security at the base, it had yet to take action when the separatists struck. Immediately after, the level of protection at the base was enhanced, the number of guards on patrol at any one time was increased from 10 to 60, and an electrified perimeter fence was added. Other security recommendations included making improvements to lighting around the base, adding an alarm system, increasing training of security personnel, and installing a closed-circuit television system. Muñiz Air National Guard Base circa 1994., Google Earth At the same time, the Air Force Chief of Staff requested that the commanders of all the service’s Major Commands review their own security programs and look at areas where possible improvements could be made. As a result of this study, funds were made available for security enhancements at 44 airbases considered to be under a high level of threat, 15 of which were overseas. Furthermore, as part of the Five Year Defense Plan beginning in Fiscal Year 1984, other improvements were made, including the provision of four-man fire teams, additional lighting at selected bases, and more vehicles, radios, and personal equipment sets for security units. The budget for the following fiscal year added antiterrorism components to a range of existing training programs, including basic military training.

In the meantime, years of asymmetric conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have brought security of U.S. airbases — and other military installations — more sharply into focus, while the range of threats to these facilities has increased. In Afghanistan, in particular, U.S. airbases faced a serious threat from Taliban insurgents, with the most notorious attack occurring at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province in March 2012. In that incident, the Taliban made it onto the base and caused chaos, killing two, wounding many more, and destroying or badly damaging nine aircraft. As for Puerto Rico, the number of military bases on the island was reduced sharply following the end of the Cold War. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard stopped flying combat jets in 1998, trading its F-16 Vipers for C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, and transforming into the 156th Airlift Wing . It lost its flying mission entirely in 2019, less than two years after Hurricane Maria battered its main base and nearly a year after a tragic accident exposed a culture of apathy and poor morale. It has since reorganized its former flying units to support the U.S. Air Force’s recent push to revitalize its ability to rapidly deploy and establish forward bases overseas during major crises and conflicts. A line-up of Hercules aircraft of the 156th Airlift Wing at Muñiz Air National Guard Base in 2015., U.S. Air National Guard/Tech Sgt. Efrain Sanchez The Boricua Popular Army still exists, but multiple arrests of its members in the 1980s, followed by a restructuring of the organization and then the killing of its leader, Filiberto Ojeda Ríos , in a botched arrest operation by the FBI in 2005, all had a significant effect. Since then, multiple non-binding referendums have been held on the future status of Puerto Rico. Most recently, in November 2020, a majority of residents voted in favor of becoming a U.S. state. This all, however, remains a contested issue within the U.S. government at the national level, as well as among Puerto Rico’s own leading political parties,  and the long-term position of the territory in regards to the United States is yet to be resolved.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 31, 2020",This Is Our Best Look Yet At China’s Z-20F Seahawk Clone Toting Air-To-Surface Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new, much clearer picture has emerged of a Chinese Z-20F helicopter , the navalized variant of the Harbin Z-20 , carrying what appears to be a load of eight live KD-10 air-to-ground/surface missiles. The image confirms that China is evaluating at least two different stub wing designs for the Z-20 family, which are generally described as clones of the Sikorsky H-60/S-70 series. This would mirror the development of different external stores systems for Sikorsky’s Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters . The photograph of the armed Z-20F originated on the Chinese microblogging website Weibo and has since begun to appear on other social media platforms . The picture shows the helicopter carrying four KD-10s on each of its two stub wings, one of which is fitted to each side of the fuselage. An older picture of a Z-20F helicopter without any stub wings fitted., Chinese internet The missiles are painted black or very dark green and have what looks to be a yellow band around the center of their bodies, which typically indicates the presence of a live high explosive warhead. The helicopter also has an air data probe, used during flight testing, fitted under the nose. The stub wings are distinct from the ones that were seen on a standard Z-20 in a picture that emerged on social media in December. The external stores system on that helicopter appeared to have a total of four pylons, two on each side, with bulbous fairings on the outside edges out the outboard ones. The stub wings on the Z-20F in this new picture only look to have space for one pylon on each side and lack the fairings. The stub wings on this Z-20F are also mounted lower on the fuselage compared to ones seen on the Z-20. A standard Z-20 helicopter carrying KD-10 missiles on a stub wing system different from one seen fitted to the Z-20F., Chinese internet A side-by-side comparison of the distinct stub wing configurations seen on the Z-20F, at left, and Z-20, at right., Chinese internet All told, the Z-20Fs stub wings look very similar to stub wings available for the MH-60R , as well as a number of other Seahawk variants, which are in service with the U.S. Navy and other naval forces around the world. In U.S. Navy service, MH-60Rs generally carry variants of the AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, but they can accommodate other stores, as well, including pods capable of firing 70mm laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) rockets. A US Navy MH-60R Seahawk carrying eight AGM-114 Hellfire missiles., USN With these weapons, the U.S. Navy MH-60Rs typically provide force protection, especially for higher-value ships, such as aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships , against the threat of small boat swarms. With the People’s Liberation Army Navy making significant progress on expanding its own carrier and amphibious warfare ship fleets , it’s not surprising that it is looking to be able to equip its Z-20Fs for a similar mission. The KD-10, originally developed for the Z-10 attack helicopter , is broadly analogous to the AGM-114 and would be well suited to this role in combination with China’s Seahawk clone. Z-20Fs carrying weapons like the KD-10 could also provide for added fire support during amphibious operations, as well as for special operations forces during raids on land or at sea. There is also the possibility that these stub wings for Z-20F, or even more robust designs that may be forthcoming, could carry other kinds of munitions to engage a wider array of maritime threats. For instance, it would make sense that a naval version of this helicopter would be adapted for the anti-submarine role with air-dropped torpedoes. Arming the Z-20Fs with relatively small anti-ship cruise missiles could be another option. India is notably in the process of acquiring MH-60Rs that will be able to carry an air-launched version of the Norwegian-designed Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a capability that is also being marketed to other Seahawk operators worldwide. No matter what, China’s Seahawk and Black Hawk clones look to be set for a future performing various missions, including multiple armed roles, just like the American helicopters that clearly informed their development.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Nov 19, 2020",Iran Commissions Its Massive Oil Tanker Turned Sea Base Into Service,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Iran’s Navy has formally commissioned the Makran , a former oil tanker it says has been transformed into a “forward base ship.” This vessel could provide a platform for more persistent maritime operations in and outside of the country’s own littoral areas. The Makran was converted from the former oil tanker Persian Gulf and seems to have been launched in its new form late last year , with satellite images in late November revealing that its dry dock had been flooded. According to H.I. Sutton , an author and an expert on maritime special forces craft, the ship looks to have undertaken sea trials in mid-December in the Strait of Hormuz . This vessel’s entry into service also comes almost two months after the naval component of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) received its own new, but smaller, sea base-type ship, the Shahid Roudaki , which you can read about more in this past War Zone piece . The new helicopter deck on the forward end of the Makran ., Iranian state media With a length of 755 feet, the Makran is considerably larger than the Shahid Roudaki , the IRGC’s modified roll-on/roll-off ship, which is 492 feet long. The new Iranian Navy vessel is closer in general size to the U.S. Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Bases (ESB), which are 764 feet long. The ESBs, which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , are also notably derived from the Alaska class oil tanker design. Iranian media reports quote Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, the commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (IRIN), as saying the Makran will be able to embark six to seven helicopters. Video from Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news outlet shows some of Iran’s RH-53D Sea Stallion , SH-3D or AS-61A-4 Sea King , and AB212ASW helicopters operating from the ship’s flight deck. The same video shows a vertical takeoff and landing drone, which appears to be an indigenous Pelican-2 , a type already in Iranian Navy service, flying from the ship. Iran says that this unmanned aircraft is primarily intended for surveillance missions. VTOL drones were also seen on the deck of the Shahid Roudaki when it first emerged publicly last November, but these were smaller-scale quad-copter-type unmanned aerial systems, with very limited payload capacity and endurance. The video below is older footage of the Pelican-2 from around when it was publicly unveiled in 2019. Iranian media claims that the Makran will also be able to undertake other missions including electronic warfare and special operations. In the past, Rear Admiral Khanzadi has also talked of the vessel’s “missile and weapons capabilities,” although it is not clear what these might consist of. The smaller Shahid Roudaki , by way of comparison, has been shown with missile systems arranged on the deck, including anti-ship cruise missiles in container launchers, plus a surface-to-air missile system on a road-mobile transport-erector-launcher. There is certainly space aft of the Makran ’s flight deck, and perhaps also ahead of it, for similar weapons arrangements . Like the Shahid Roudaki, the new ship has sufficient open deck area to possibly accommodate other weapon systems, as well, including fixed or road-mobile cruise and ballistic missile launchers, or large-caliber rocket artillery. Other kinds of mobile surface-to-air missile systems, as well as the radars associated with them, could also fit onboard. As it is, the apparent lack of air defense systems would put the ship at a severe disadvantage, its size making it an obvious and attractive target. However, just simply as a product of its overall size, the Makran should offer capabilities above and beyond the Shahid Roudaki . Overall, at least in general concept and outward design, it actually seems to have more in common with the U.S. Navy’s Expeditionary Mobile Base concept . Unlike the ESBs, however, the Iranian ship lacks the utility deck that is closer to the waterline, for loading and unloading of stores, which would seem to reduce its overall flexibility. Without knowing its exact configuration internally, and how easy it might be to adapt it from one role to another, the Makran ’s exact capabilities are unclear. We do know, however, what kinds of missions the U.S. Navy’s ESBs are primarily tailored for , and it is at least possible that the Makran might take on similar roles. These might include counter-mine, special operations, humanitarian, anti-submarine, counter-piracy, and maritime security missions. The counter-mine and anti-submarine missions, in particular, are ones with particular resonance in the Persian Gulf and could involve Iranian Navy helicopters of the types we have already seen conducting trials from the Makran. The vessel’s commissioning with the IRIN rather than IRGC would also seem to point to a conventional aspect to its intended concept of operations. That being said, the Makran , like the Shahid Roudaki , could still be used, for example, as an extension of the concept of operations that have already been proven out by the Iranian covert operations ship MV Saviz . This is a modified cargo vessel that has reportedly been used for offshore surveillance, command, and liaison duties in the Red Sea in support of the Houthis in Yemen. You can read more about that ship in this previous War Zone piece . An AB212ASW helicopter, drones, speedboats, and a surface-to-air missile system on the deck of the Shahid Roudaki ., via Twitter Clearly, an Iranian expeditionary sea base, forward-deployed to the Red Sea, could be of great value in supporting the Iranian-backed Houthi militia operating in Yemen. Potentially it could also serve as a platform for more directly challenging Iran’s regional opponents, including Saudi Arabia. The Makran could certainly provide a more robust “mother ship” for different types of discreet or asymmetric operations by Iranian forces, such as the high-profile attacks launched against tankers in the Gulf of Oman in 2019. These included the use of limpet mines, which could be delivered by combat divers or personnel on small boats launched from a larger vessel. In the same way, the Iranian Navy’s new sea base-type ship could support more general special operations missions, including raids at sea or ashore. On the other hand, it should be recalled that Iran has a track record of making questionable claims about the capabilities of its warships. As well as the Shahid Roudaki itself, the utility of which The War Zone has examined in the past , there are also the Sahand “stealth destroyer,” a missile corvette type vessel lacking any low-observable features, and the Kharg , a fleet tanker with a helipad that has been repeatedly and credulously described as a “ helicopter carrier .” Time will tell exactly how Iran plans on using the Makran , and just how useful it might be for the types of asymmetric and otherwise limited operations that Iran regularly engages in.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Why Marine One Was Making All That Commotion Near The Vice President’s Residence Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the top trending topics on Twitter this afternoon was Marine One . The spike in interest in the presidential helicopters was due to some heavy flight traffic by them around the Vice President’s Residence at the Naval Observatory, which is located about three miles to the northwest of the White House. The movements were so noticeable that NBC’s Michael Beschloss tweeted about it , which catapulted the Twittersphere into wild theory and conspiracy manufacturing mode. Considering the unprecedented events of the last week on Capitol Hill , this is hardly surprising. So, I wrote a tweet thread on the topic that tried to explain what folks were seeing. Although the explanations are far less entertaining than what some may hope, many seemed to appreciate the commentary and background, so I thought I would adapt it and do a formal post on the matter. There are two major possibilities here to point out, and both of them being accurate simultaneously is actually more probable than not. Keep in mind that none of this is definitive, but it should go a long way in helping to explain what folks were likely seeing, and calm some nerves in the process. The iconic ‘White Top’ VH-3D., JTOcchialini/wikicommons HMX-1 is the elite Marine helicopter squadron that flies the VH-3D and VH-60N “White Top” helicopters that are used for presidential airlift operations, as well as MV-22 Ospreys that support those missions and others. When the President is on board any of these airframes, that aircraft goes by the callsign “Marine One.” When the Vice President is on board, the callsign is “Marine Two.” During the vast majority of these operations, HMX-1 flies identical airframes in pairs, with one being the decoy aircraft. Together they play a constant shell game to confuse potential adversaries. In order to accomplish this mission, HMX-1 crews need to train. The mission is incredibly demanding as it is a no-failure proposition. The urban landing zones, in particular, including the on South Lawn at the White House and the grass landing areas up at the Naval Observatory are not simple to safely and reliably get in and out of. So, crews need currency training. This is especially true when they are at heightened alert, as is pretty much everyone in the national security apparatus around Washington, D.C. right now, and especially those dealing with protecting the country’s political leadership. In addition, these highly specialized aircraft and their crews are not just tasked with moving POTUS and the VP around the region and especially to nearby Andrews Air Force Base for flights aboard Air Force One and Air Force Two. They are absolutely essential to Continuity Of Government (COG) operations , which come in many shades. In fact, they are part of a small air force of helicopters based around the Capital Region that all have a secondary tasking of supporting COG missions. You can read all about these units, including HMX-1, and this mission in this previous feature of mine , as well as this article about recent operations that have raised local concerns. The Vice President’s residence at Number One Observatory Circle. , White House The Naval Observatory with the VP’s residence up in the northwest corner. , Google Earth The VP’s residence. , Google Earth Part of HMX-1’s role in COG operations includes quickly snatching POTUS and the VP and whisking them away to highly secure remote facilities were a major threat to emerge. This highly challenging action has to occur in a manner of minutes . This is partially why HMX-1 has a heavily guarded forward operating location at Naval Support Facility Anacostia, which is located just three miles from the White House. The unit is otherwise based 30 miles south of the Capital in Quantico, Virginia. With all this in mind, practice is important, especially considering the state of play in the Capital at this time. In fact, one could argue it is more critical now than at any time in recent memory. Beyond training, consider what happened last week, which included throngs of Trump supporters screaming in unison to hang Mike Pence just for doing what the Constitution states. This was an absolutely despicable demonstration by a crazed mob and it clearly sent a chill through the ecosystem that is tasked with protecting Vice President. As such, security has surely been tightened around him. The practice of primarily using the motorcade to get the Vice President where he needs to go, and especially from his residence to the White House and the Old Executive Building, is among the most obvious security changes that should happen, and we can only hope that it has. The alternative to the motorcade’s armored vehicle procession is using HMX-1’s White Tops. This would result in a sudden spike in helicopter activity at the Vice President’s residence. It may demand some additional training for HMX-1 crews in order to support the new transportation regime over the coming days. This combined reality is likely what folks are seeing. VH-60N White Hawk about to touch down with a Secret Service agent directing it., John Murphy /Wikicommons If there was some sort of sudden transfer of power, this type of HMX-1 activity wouldn’t necessarily be an indicator of it, although such a transfer could occur at any time. Anything is possible at this point. So, there should be nothing to worry about here. It is just the White House Military Office, the Secret Service, and the folks of HMX-1 adapting to a changing security environment. This is precisely why we spend mountains of money to plan for such changes and to have the capabilities in place that can make them a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 10, 2021",Russian Navy Commander Stole Two 13-Ton Bronze Propellers From His Own Destroyer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian Navy says that a former commander of the now-decommissioned Sovremenny class destroyer Bespokoynyy conspired with others and stole the ship’s two bronze propellers while it was in dry dock being converted into a floating museum. The alleged caper sounds like it was ripped straight from the plot of a comedic Hollywood heist movie, with the thieves reportedly swapping out the pair of screws, each weighing approximately 13 tons, for ones made out of a cheaper metal. Russian media outlet Interfa x reported on Jan. 11, 2021, that Sergei Sharshavykh, head of the military investigation department of the Russian Navy’s Baltic Fleet , confirmed that the investigation into the theft was nearly complete. The names of the former commander of the Bespokoynyy , or any of their accomplices, and what kind of jail time or fines they might be facing, were not disclosed. The two propellers are valued at approximately 39 million rubles, or just over $522,513 at the rate of exchange at the time of writing. The decommissioned Sovremenny class destroyer Bespokoynyy under tow in 2018., Russian Ministry of Defense Sharshavykh, the Russian Navy investigator told Interfax that, to “cover their tracks,” those involved in the theft had imitation screws made up, the “cost and quality of which are several times lower” than the original bronze ones. The heist took place at the Yantar Shipyard in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave , which is geographically separated from the rest of the country and is situated between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea. Kaliningrad, which is heavily militarized as a whole, is also home to the headquarters of the Baltic Fleet. It’s unclear when the theft took place, but Sharshavykh said that happened after Bespokoynyy arrived at Yantar in 2016 for conversion into a museum ship as part of its decommissioning from the Russian Navy. That process included remove the destroyer’s two propellers, as well as its driveshafts, and sealing the hull in such a way as to allow it to remain afloat, but without the need for regular maintenance. The destroyer was finally formally decommissioned in 2018 and is now on display at the Patriot Park in Kronstadt, on Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. A total of 21 examples of the Sovremenny class, also known as Project 956 Sarych class, were built, the first of which was delivered to the Soviet Navy in 1980. Construction of these ships, including four that ultimately went to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), continued in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Bespokoynyy was only commissioned on Dec. 28, 1991, two days after the Supreme Soviet formally voted to dissolve the Union of Soviet Social Republics. The Sovremennyy photographed underway in 1982., USN These destroyers displace around 6,600 tons with a basic load, but that can grow to nearly 8,500 tons with a full combat load. The primary armament of the ships were eight P-270 Moskit supersonic anti-ship missiles, also known as the SS-N-22 Sunburn to NATO. They could also carry up to 48 3S90 Uragan surface-to-air missiles, the navalized version of the 9K37 Buk , also referred to by NATO as the SA-N-7 Gadfly. The ships had two twin 130mm gun mounts, as well as torpedo tubes, which were also capable of firing anti-submarine missiles, and AK-630 close-in weapon systems. At the time of the first ship’s introduction, the Sovremenny class also had some of the most advanced radars, communication systems, and electronic warfare systems anywhere in the Soviet fleet. The initial Project 956 design was followed by a slightly improved Project 956A variant, which was most readily distinguished by the addition of longer missile tubes to accommodate improved versions of the P-270 missile. The PLAN examples were of further upgraded types known as the Type 956E and 956EM , which have subsequently been refitted further to replace many of the Soviet-era weapons and other systems with more modern Chinese types, including the YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship missile and the HQ-16 surface-to-air missile . The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Project 956EM destroyer Taizhou in 2015., Japanese Ministry of Defense All four Chinese examples remain in service, but the Russian Navy only has four technically still in service. Of these, three – Burnyy , Nastoycvyy , and Admiral Ushakov – are presently undergoing major overhauls. The Bystryy remains active with the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet . The Russian Navy’s Sovremenny class destroyer Bystryy ., USN As to the case of the Bespokoynyy , the revelation that its screws had been stolen comes just over a month after reports emerged that thieves had taken unspecified “radio equipment” out of one of the Russian Air Force’s highly sensitive Il-80 Maxdome “doomsday aircraft,” an airborne command post for use during major crises, including a nuclear conflict. You can read more about that incident and its implications in this past War Zone piece . Though the weight of the propellers, which must be quite large, might make it seem hard to believe that even a group of knowledgable criminals were able to steal them without someone noticing, it’s hardly the first time enterprising Russian thieves have carried out such a brazen heist. In 2008, there was a report that an entire 200-ton metal bridge had been dismantled and stolen to be sold for scrap. In 2016, in a case of literal highway robbery , a municipal Russian official oversaw the removal of some 7,000 reinforced concrete slabs from 31 miles of road, again for resale on the black market. When it comes to Bespokoynyy ‘s propellers, it seems much more likely than not that other Russian Navy and shipyard officials were also involved in the heist. It’s not clear if the bronze screws, or what’s left of them, if they haven’t already been sold for scrap, have been recovered. Thankfully, unlike the theft of equipment from the Il-80, this destroyer was already headed into retirement when this theft took place. It’s still an ignoble footnote, though one that seems ripe for a comedy heist flick, for this warship, which had served the Soviet and Russian Navies for more than 25 years. All told, it is safe to say that someone got screwed. Contact the author: joe@thedrive.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Destroyers Navies Russian Navy Sea"
Thomas Newdick,"Posted on Jul 20, 2020",China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter First Flew 10 Years Ago Today. A Two-Seater Could Be Next.,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Exactly 10 years from its first flight, the Chengdu J-20 remains, without doubt, the main focus of global attention when it comes to China’s military aircraft developments. Within the People’s Republic of China, too, the jet known as the Mighty Dragon has become a totem for the country’s fast-emerging high-technology defense sector and its associated aviation industries . Plenty has happened since the J-20’s first sensational appearance in late 2010, including the appearance of a second stealth fighter , which is yet to enter service. Meanwhile, many column inches have been spent attempting to assess the J-20’s weapons and capabilities , its likely future development path, and even its basic mission. Now, it seems, the next development in the program could be a two-seat version for training as well as combat missions. An official video released recently by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, the parent conglomerate responsible for the Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Group that builds the J-20, features a computer-generated sequence showing a formation of two-seat versions of the fighter. While there has been some previous speculation that such a variant might be developed, this is apparently the first time a concept of it has been seen in any kind of official imagery. Computer-generated imagery of a possible two-seat J-20 from the AVIC video. , YouTube Screencap Of course, the release of the video is no guarantee that a two-seat J-20 is in development, or, if it is, that it will emerge looking as it does in this computer-generated form. Over the years, however, the J-20 program has provided a few surprises. It is worth remembering that when it first appeared on the runway at Chengdu, the black-painted J-20 was deemed by some Western observers to be a technology demonstrator at best, not the country’s first stealth fighter. However, after some minor tweaks , service entry followed in late 2016 and the jet is now in quantity production as only the third such stealthy fighter to become operational anywhere in the world. One of the most revealing early shots of the J-20. , Chinese Internet The most recent major development concerning the J-20 has been the steady introduction of an indigenous powerplant to the series-built aircraft. While the prototypes and early production batches were powered by Russian-supplied AL-31 turbofans, more recent J-20A aircraft use the indigenous WS-10. The engine in question is the WS-10C, a different version to that used in the single-engine Chengdu J-10C multirole fighter, and which features distinctive ‘serrated’ exhaust petals, designed to reduce aircraft’s rear hemisphere radar cross-section (RCS). Today, Western sources estimate the number of J-20s built by the end of 2019 as around 50 , a figure that likely also includes pre-production machines. Unconfirmed Chinese reports suggest that a production capacity of 48 aircraft annually, but there is no evidence that that figure has been attained. China has shown, however, that it is able to rapidly produce large numbers of military aircraft and this goal could well be met longer-term. Equally importantly, the J-20 has been incrementally improved while production continued. In a paper released last October, the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, think tank claimed that “subsequent developments are likely to increase its LO [low-observable] characteristics and sensor capabilities.” A J-20A powered by WS-10C engines and reportedly destined for a frontline unit., YouTube Screencap As for a two-seat version of the J-20, this would further set the aircraft apart from its closest counterparts, the American F-22 and F-35, and from the Russian Su-57 Felon , the latter of which is not yet in frontline service. None of these have been built in two-seat form, although India did seek a two-seat version of the Su-57 before it abandoned plans to co-produce it with Russia. Provided its equipped with dual controls, a two-seat J-20 would clearly provide a useful training platform for pilots converting to the type with either an operational regiment or perhaps even a tactical training unit. It would also make sense from a doctrinal point of view since most of China’s modern fighters are also available as combat-capable two-seaters, while others have been specifically developed as two-seat strike fighters . Moreover, for the types of combat missions that the J-20 is likely to undertake, a second crew member might be especially valuable. Western analysts have long expected the J-20 to offer considerable range, allowing it to perform penetrating counter-air missions far out into contested airspace, including over the South China Sea . Two pilots would help reduce crew fatigue and better battle-manage during complex missions lasting for long periods. China’s ambition to further stretch the range of the J-20, even if just for ferry flights to far-flung locations, was apparent when an example was seen carrying four massive auxiliary fuel tanks in 2017. When it first appeared, some attributed a likely offensive role to the J-20, perhaps including strike, and although there has been no evidence of this to date, a second crew member is also a useful attribute for purely air defense missions, especially those of long duration. Long-range combat air patrols and hunting down enemy force-multiplier assets, for example, would fit well into China’s established anti-access/area denial strategy and would benefit from two crew members. While a traditional weapons systems officer in the back seat might be in charge of all the aircraft’s weapons, and how they are employed, as well as navigation and attack avionics, China’s increasing interest in unmanned combat aerial vehicles, or UCAVs, suggests that a notional J-20 back-seater could also serve as a drone controller, managing loyal wingman-type unmanned aircraft or swarming UCAVs . A two-seat J-20 is not the only potential new development of the stealth fighter, however. The War Zone has already looked at the prospects for a mooted J-20B version, likely to feature upgraded indigenous powerplants, perhaps with thrust-vectoring controls, as well as increased power. You can read more about the possibilities for that version here . The achievements so far in China’s first stealth fighter program are impressive by any measure, but especially when one recalls that, when it first appeared, there was much Western skepticism that the J-20 was a credible design. The first flight of a J-20 prototype, on January 11, 2011, coincided with a visit to China by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Gates repeatedly downplayed China’s ability to field such a weapon and predicted that the fighter wouldn’t be ready for service until the 2020s, at the earliest. For now, it remains to be seen just what changes the next iteration of the J-20 will bring, but, based on past experience, the ability of China’s military aerospace industry to spring a surprise shouldn’t be discounted.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 4, 2019",New Sci-Fi Looking Pistol Packs 50 Rounds Of High-Velocity Personal Defense Weapon Ammo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Personal Defense Weapons, largely referred to as PDWs , have displaced sub-machine guns for a number of military and law enforcement applications. Whereas the handgun cartridge spewing sub-gun was great at delivering highly-accurate volumes of fire even in very tight combat conditions, they lacked the ability to punch through ever more prevalent and capable body armor. Enter the PDW, which uses what can be loosely described as a miniaturized rifle cartridge that lacks the stopping power and range of their bigger cousins, but can punch through many types of body armor with ease, are extremely accurate, and can fit inside a highly ergonomic and compact weapon system. While PDW cartridges have already been adopted in multiple handgun platforms, most notably Fabrique Nationale’s FN Five-seveN , American gunmaker Kel-Tec just announced a pistol that looks more like it belongs on the set of a sci-fi film than in a holster of a soldier or law enforcement officer. Oh, and this new weapon packs a whopping 50 high-velocity rounds in a single magazine . Kel-Tec There are a growing number of PDWs on the market today, but the most well known is probably the Fabrique Nationale’s P90 , which replaced the MP5 within the U.S. Secret Service , and HK’s MP7 , which is famously used by SEAL Team Six. While smaller high-velocity rounds defined the PDW segment, it is increasingly blending with smaller and smaller weapons that leverage full-sized rifle cartridges, but that is a whole other story . SEAL Team 6/DEVGRU kit. MP7 and HK416 in matching camo. The real gem is the 'Pirate Gun,' the sawed-off M79 40mm break-open grenade launcher made famous by 'Mark Owen's' book No Easy Day. pic.twitter.com/IzwEwun4ZX — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) October 6, 2020 P90., Fabrique National/FN America The reality is that both the MP7 and P90 have many users around the globe, from police departments to top tier special operations units. They fire different ammunition, but the P90’s 5.7x28mm cartridge has caught on more than H&K’s 4.6x30mm cartridge. Once again, FN’s aforementioned Five-seveN pistol, in addition to the P90, fires the 5.7mm round. Other PDW developers have also leveraged the ammo for their own designs, such as the AR57 and the Diamondback DBX 5.7 . A comparison, from right to left, of the 5.56x45mm, 4.6x30mm HK, 5.7x28mm FN, and 9x19mm Parabellum cartridges. A AAA battery is shown at the far left for scale. PDW cartridges offer rifle-like velocities in excess of 2,000 feet per second (typically 9mm stays shy of 1,000 feet per second) in a package that is about half the size of its full-size rifle cartridge counterparts., Grasyl/wikicommons The P90’s unique bullpup design, which is now 30 years old, leveraged a unique slab-like, flush-fitting, top-loading, translucent magazine design that holds 50 rounds. This fits well with the PDW concept, which trades a bit of stopping power for armored penetration and very fast follow-up shots via rapid cycling in automatic or burst, as well as semi-automatic modes. The magazine was purpose-built to make the P90 as small of a package as possible, so that it could fit under a coat or be used from within the tight confines of a vehicle. As such, the magazine itself, which rotates the cartridge 90 degrees prior to loading, is its own technological innovation and has helped the cartridge become more popular than its competition. The feeding system on the P90’s 50-round magazine rotates the cartridge 90 degrees. , ROG5728/Wikicommons FN’s Five-seveN full-sized service pistol uses its own separate standard box-like magazine, holding 20 rounds in a fairly light overall package. With the right ammunition—an issue we will get to in a moment—even the pistol, with its shorter barrel, provides the ability to penetrate body armor designed to stop all types of handgun cartridges. One can see how such a capability would come in handy in an era where body armor is readily available and an increasing feature not just on battlefields overseas, but in active shooter and other criminal situations here at home. FN Five-seveN, FN America So, what Kel-Tec did is that they built something between a PDW and a full-framed pistol that is designed specifically around FN’s 50-round P90 magazines. As such, the gun packs a tremendous amount of firepower at the ready in a relatively small package. Although, at 3.2 pounds, it isn’t exactly as ergonomic or lightweight as a full-frame service pistol. In fact, it includes the ability to attach a sling to it, if that gives you any idea of how it sits outside the side of a standard full-frame pistol. Still, the arrangement retains a 9.3-inch barrel, which is roughly double the barrel length of a full-frame pistol, including the FN Five-seveN. In fact, it is just an inch shy of the P90’s barrel. This allows for far improved ballistic performance for the 5.7x28mm round. Reloading occurs by the entire upper receiver and barrel assembly tilting upward via a forward hinge. Then the big empty longitudinal P90 magazine snaps out and a full mag snaps in. The P50 also comes with a full upper Picatinny accessory rail system, as well as one at the forward end of its frame, so red-dot optics, lasers, and weapons lights can all be accommodated. And yes, it looks like it is something right out of Netflix’s latest sci-fi thriller. Kel-Tec While the P50 is unique in the amount of firepower it packs for its size, and especially for its pistol classification, it is limited in application by this classification. In a law enforcement or military configuration, a small folding stock would make the weapon far more capable and accurate and it wouldn’t take up any more room really even in some type of concealment situation. But attaching a stock, or even a vertical foregrip, would trigger far more restrictive National Firearms Act rules for the average citizen buyer, making it totally illegal without going through special administrative steps. So, as it sits now, to the average buyer, this is a pistol, just as an AK-47 Draco or a similar gun, legally, is a pistol. Then there is the question of ammunition. The advantage to this round is primarily the ability to pierce body armor that typical handgun calibers cannot, all in a very handy and accurate package. The thing is, while a number of available FN factory cartridges exist in 5.7x28mm, the SS190 aluminum core armor-piercing duty ammunition is restricted and not commonly available to civilians. Still, even some rounds that are readily available to civilians, both from FN and secondary manufacturers, have shown an ability, even if inconsistent, to pierce through some Class IIIA body armor. This makes the entire argument for the 5.7x28mm, at least in civilian hands, a bit nebulous. If your life depends on punching through class IIIA body armor, consistency is key, and the ammunition choices available, while still certainly deadly, do not cater to answering the problem that, at least in part, spurred the creation of the round in the first place. Since the average civilian purchaser cannot put a stock on it, either, it isn’t really accurate under most circumstances. At the same time, traditional submachine gun designs that adapted into ATF compliant pistols are becoming increasingly available to civilians via top manufacturers, including Sig Sauer’s Copperhead and H&K’s MP5K . So, the P50 pistol, while clearly lethal, is sort of a niche, if not a novelty on the civilian market. Still, if it proves to be a robust and reliable platform, and has the ability to be configured with a stock, it could become a very attractive PDW solution on the military and law enforcement weapons market. It really would offer the most compact package for a PDW that does not sacrifice ammunition capacity or ballistics, especially for applications where burst or full-auto modes are not necessarily needed, although Kel-Tec may be able to add those. Furthermore, it would offer all this in a package that is just under two and a half pounds lighter than the P90 and just 15 inches in length compared to the P90’s 19.9 inches. Because of the P90’s fixed polymer bullpup stock arrangement, there is no folding option. Sling attachment points on the P50., Kelt-Tec That being said, Kel-Tec isn’t really known for a big footprint in the military or law enforcement issued firearms space, although they have found some success with their somewhat innovative and exotic shotguns, such as the KSG, with some police and military units. So, the P50 would have to really prove itself if the Kel-Tec hopes to make this more than just a range toy for those with and loose $1000 to spend and significantly more money available to blow on ammo in the following months after purchase, but the potential certainly seems there. And maybe, that’s just the plan. Considering their own webpage on the weapon states that the P50 is “Unique. Adaptable. Retro… Covert, Capable, Provocative” and “it doesn’t come with a white Ferrari and salmon blazer , however it does come with some other amazing features including two 50-round magazines. This 5.7 chambered handgun is sure to gather props from your buddies and range rats alike,” maybe they are focusing on the cool factor for domestic sales, at least for now, over marketing it to law enforcement or the military. Still, it would not be all that uncommon for far more ‘creative’ and hyperbolic language to be used in a firearm’s commercial marketing materials compared to its direct to military and law enforcement marketing materials. If anything else, it will be cool to see this unique weapon as the new off-the-shelf ‘wow isn’t that cool’ futuristic blaster in the next gritty science fiction television series, and the next, and probably the next after that.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2022",U.S. Navy Amphibious Warship To Deploy With Anti-Ship Missiles Next Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking to integrate the new Naval Strike Missile onto at least one amphibious warfare ship in the coming year. This is part of a larger effort to look at ways to increase the firepower of these types of vessels, which could eventually include the addition of containerized missile launchers. U.S. Marine Corps Major General Tracy King, the head of the Expeditionary Warfare division within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, gave reporters details about these plans on Jan. 8. 2021. The Navy first announced it would acquire the Norwegian-designed Naval Strike Missile (NSM), which the U.S. military has now also designated the RGM-184, in 2018. The immediate plan, since then, has been to integrate those missiles onto both subclasses of the service’s Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), though that process has been moving slowly, as you can read about in this previous War Zone piece . The NSM is also set to be part of the arsenal on the future Constellation class guided missile frigates . The landing platform dock amphibious warfare ship USS San Antonio . The Navy has said that San Antonio class ships are among those they are exploring the idea of arming with a containerized missile launch system., USN “We have these magnificent 600-foot-long, highly survivable … LPD 17s,” King said. “I suspect what you will see in the next year that we will probably test-fire a system off of an L-class ship and let the fleet play around with it, build up the doctrine on how we will use it and to confirm or deny whether it is worth the expense, which we think it is. We need the operators to confirm that.” LPD 17 is the hull number of the first San Antonio class landing platform dock, one of the Navy’s most modern amphibious warfare ship designs. Examples of a Flight II San Antonio design , which are slightly smaller and have reduced capabilities compared to the first generation ships, are also now under construction to eventually replace the service’s Whidbey Island class and Harpers Ferry class dock landing ships. The Navy collectively refers to all of its amphibious warfare ships, the classification codes for which all begin with the letter L for “landing,” such as LPD, as “L-class” ships. A brief visual overview of the changes in the Flight II San Antonio design compared to the first generation ships., Huntington Ingalls Industries “The LPDs need the ability to reach out and defend themselves and sink another ship,” Major General King explained. “It’s not from the aspect of using them as a strike platform; it will drastically increase their survivability if the enemy has to honor that threat.” The NSM is a stealthy , subsonic, sea-skimming cruise missile with a range of around 100 miles that Kongsberg developed primarily to engage other ships. The weapon uses a GPS-assisted International Navigation System (INS) guidance package, together with terrain recognition, to get to the general target area. After this, it switches over to an imaging infrared seeker that finds the target using an internal database of information about representative ship types. This gives the missile added accuracy and allows it to more effectively discriminate between the vessel it was fired at and other objects, such as decoys. It also makes it less vulnerable to electronic warfare jamming and other countermeasures. You can read more about the NSM in these past War Zone pieces . Adding these missiles to the San Antonios , as well as other existing or future amphibious warfare, together with any necessary additional fire control architecture, could definitely give them an immediate ability to defend themselves against other naval threats. The San Antonio class ships already have a capable AN/SPQ-9B surface search and fire control radar and could employ helicopters, such as the MH-60R Seahawk , for over-the-horizon targeting. The Navy is already invested heavily in efforts to network all of its ships, submarines, and aircraft together through various efforts, as well, such as Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air ( NIFC-CA ). These networks could also eventually tie into those that other services are working on , which could allow for targeting information to come from various offboard sources. In addition, the San Antonio design was originally supposed to have two eight-cell Mk 41 Vertical Launch System Arrays (VLS). The planned concept of operations for those San Antonios was to have been to load each of the 16 VLS cells with a quad-pack of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles, but they could have accommodated other weapons, as well. Today, these ships are armed with two Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers, as well as a pair of turreted 30mm automatic cannons , for close-in defense. There have been numerous discussions in the past , including here at The War Zone , about possibly installing Mk 41s or other weapon systems on the San Antonios in the end. The Navy is in process of testing a laser directed energy weapon, known as the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD) Mk 2 Mod 0, on the San Antonio class USS Portland , an installation that leverages some of the space leftover from the omission of the Mk 41s. Depending on its exact design, a containerized missile launching system of some kind could provide the Navy with added flexibility, allowing the service to more readily install and remove launchers from ships, as necessary. A launcher capable of firing more than just NSMs, or that has some kind of modular design that could be more easily adapted to launch other weapons in the future, could offer other additional capabilities for L-class ships or other naval vessels with sufficient space. The NSM itself has an inherent land-attack capability, in addition to its primary function as an anti-ship weapon. This could be valuable for knocking out enemy defenses on the shore or targets immediately inland during amphibious operations. An artist’s conception of a notional missile launching system fitted inside a standard shipping container fitted to the rear of a Freedom class littoral combat ship from a Marine Corps document published in 2016., USMC These seem to be among the exact questions Major General King is hoping to start answering in the coming year. “My prediction is that we will have one [L-class ship equipped with NSM] within the next 12 months,” he said. “We will let the fleet play around with it probably a year or so and then decide how we’re going to field it.” This is not the first time the Navy has explored potential ways to rapidly integrated NSMs onto ships, either. As part of testing leading up to the initial acquisition of these missiles for the LCSs, the service fired some of these weapons from a launcher lashed to the helipad on the Independence class LCS USS Coronado . That arrangement notably included the flatrack assembly from the truck-mounted launcher that is part of the ground-launched NSM system that Kongsberg markets for coastal defense. A Naval Strike Missile flies from a launch on the helipad of the Independence class LCS USS Coronado ., USN A truck-mounted NSM launcher for use in the coast defense role., Kongsberg The Marine Corps has also already test-fired the High Mobility Rocket Artillery System (HIMARS) from the deck of a San Antonio class ship in the past and is now looking to adapt the truck-mounted HIMARS launcher to fire the NSM. As such, Major General King raised the possibility that perhaps L-class ships might simply use embarked Marine missile units in the future, rather than actually gaining their own new launchers. As part of its dramatic force structure reorganization, which you can read more about in this previous War Zone story , the Marine Corps is looking to acquire an array of new long-range strike weapons, including ground-launched NSMs and Tomahawks , with a particular focus on taking out hostile ships. The U.S. Army is also now exploring ground-based Tomahawks , as well as a ground-launched version of the Navy’s very capable SM-6 missile . “When we jump on aboard a ship, that [weapon system] becomes available to the ship’s captain,” King explained. “So maybe we don’t need to install launchers and NSMs.” “I am a little bit dismissive of that complaint because the ship’s got to get there first,” he added, in response to a question about whether this concept of operations would then leave Marine units without any missiles to fire after arriving at their destination. “So, I think you’re going to see us deploying containerized weapon systems that we can use wherever we want to use them.” Major General King also addressed the separate issue about concerns about the general delivery schedule of NSMs to the Navy. At least as of last summer, Raytheon had yet to establish robust U.S.-based manufacturing and supply chains as planned. “My intent is to ensure that my desire to increase lethality of LPDs doesn’t interfere with [Director of Surface Warfare Rear Admiral Paul] Schlise’s efforts to increase lethality on LCSs,” King said. “It’s a legitimate concern [about] putting these very rare systems on an L-class ship instead of another kind of warship.” Regardless, increasing the firepower of ships such as the San Antonios seems to be a growing priority for the Navy. In recent years, the Navy has become increasingly concerned about the survivability of amphibious warfare ships, as well as support ships, in a future high-end conflict, especially in the broad expanses of the Pacific. Official Navy artwork from 2003 showing, among other things, the USS San Antonio , in the foreground, firing a missile from VLS array on its bow., USN The Navy has declared that China, which is dramatically expanding its naval capabilities, as well as developing and fielding ever-more capable anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles that can be fired from sea , air , and land-based platforms , “our most press long-term strategic threat.” This is a view shared by the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, which last year collectively issued a first-of-its-kind integrated maritime security strategy . Russia, as well as smaller countries, such as North Korea and Iran , continue to make advances that also present increasing challenges for amphibious warfare and other types of naval operations. This has already prompted the Navy and Marine Corps to begin exploring entirely new distributed warfare concepts for amphibious operations that reduce the dependence on large L-class ships, something you read about more in this past War Zone piece. Test firing an NSM from an amphibious warfare ship later this year would be an important step toward giving those ships additional tools to protect themselves against naval threats, as well as potentially engage other targets at sea or on land.

Joseph Trevithick and Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Jan 7, 2021",Capitol Siege Shines Light On Vast Underground Tunnel Network,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even before this week’s unprecedented siege of the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump, which you can read about in the War Zone ‘s rolling coverage of the events as they unfolded, there were ominous indicators of what was to come. This included the discovery of pipe bombs in the vicinity of nearby Congressional office buildings earlier in the day, which had prompted evacuations, at least in part through underground tunnels. When the Capitol itself was breached, members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence, among others, were also ushered to safety via subterranean passageways. These incidents highlighted the large tunnel network that lies under Capitol Hill, as well as other underground links throughout Washington, D.C. Many of these are used on a day-to-day basis just to conveniently get between government buildings without going outside, but, as was shown yesterday, they also have a clear value in helping people escape to safety during a crisis. Legislators had already been advised to make increased use of them on Jan. 6, simply to avoid encountering pro-Trump protesters . People evacuate from the House Camber as protesters try to break into the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington., AP Photo/Andrew Harnik When the first reports emerged of the evacuation of the Cannon House Office Building, as well as the Library of Congress’ James Madison Memorial Building, all of which are situated to the immediate southeast of the U.S. Capitol, the reasons were not immediately clear. While the focus of the world’s attention was on the crowds of Trump supporters preparing to storm the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol Police alerted the occupants of Cannon to the threat. Without mentioning the specifics of the improvised explosive devices (IED), the Capitol Police urged the occupants of Cannon to remain calm and move “in a safe manner” to the exits, due to “police activity,” according to NBC Washington . Another message called upon the staffers to “close doors behind you but do not lock.” “If you are in the Cannon Building, take visitors, escape hoods, and Go Kits and report to the South tunnel connecting to the Longworth Building,” Capitol Police also told staff there, according to NBC News reporter Scott MacFarlane. Unfortunately, we don’t know what was inside the “Go Kits” in question, but they were likely stocked with various emergency and survival items, including things like first aid supplies and glow sticks or small flashlights. Pictures from inside the Capitol after pro-Trump protesters made their way inside do show members of Congress and others wearing what appear to be ILC Dover SCape CBRN30 masks. A woman wears what appears to be an ILC Dover SCape CBRN30 hood-type emergency gas mask in the House Chamber of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021., Andrew Harnik/AP These are emergency hood-type gas masks with an integrated battery-powered air blower to help keep dangerous contaminants, including chemical and biological agents, out. These are designed to be rapidly donned in a crisis, even by people with minimal training. The hood design, which seals around the wearer’s neck, is also intended to help people who might be wearing glasses or have substantial hair on the top of their head or large beards get the mask on quickly and without issue. Other companies beyond ILC Dover also make hood-style gas masks and respirators with differing features and capabilities, including ones with their own oxygen supply that can be used to help escape fires. It’s not clear whether staff from the Cannon building, Go Kits and masks in hand, actually made their way to the Longworth Building across the street through the South Tunnel or if they simply sheltered in place in that passageway. It’s less clear how the evacuation of the James Madison Memorial Building was carried out, but it seems more likely than not that some individuals there also made their way out using tunnels that connect it to the Thomas Jefferson Building and the John Adams Building, also facilities belonging to the Library of Congress. The tunnels that connect the Cannon and James Madison Buildings to the Capitol and other nearby buildings, as well as various underground parking garages, are part of a labyrinth of at least 19 underground passages on Capitol Hill that people and vehicles can move through. The first tunnels emanating from the Capitol building itself, construction of which was initially completed in 1800, and which had been substantially rebuilt after British forces set it on fire during The War of 1812, date back to the latter half of the 19th Century. The first of these, dug out during the Civil War, were for ventilation, followed by a link to the then-new Library of Congress building nearby in 1898, through which books passed on an electrically-powered conveyor . That latter system is sadly no longer in operation. An undated picture of the conveyor inside the book tunnel between the Capitol and the Library of Congress., Library of Congress The first tunnels out of the Capitol intended for use by people were the ones linking it to the Cannon building, as well as the Russell Senate Office Building to the north. These were and remain satellite office buildings where many of America’s legislators actually work. The Cannon building opened in 1908, with the Russell building being finished the following year. From the very beginning, the Russell building has also had a subway car system , originally just electrically-powered Studebaker cars that would drive the route, to move Senators and others to and from the Capitol. A Studebaker electric subway car inside the Russell Tunnel in 1909., Architect of the Capitol As Congress’s footprint on Capitol Hill continued to expand over the next century or so, so did the number of tunnels. The passages have been steadily enlarged and improved, as well. Today, for instance, the Cannon Tunnel between it and the Capitol is closer to an underground town than it is a simple access tunnel, with a shoe repair store, post office, credit union, and cafeteria along the route. It is also distinguished by the artwork on its walls, provided by students from across the United States. Similarly, some of the tunnels that lead out of the James Madison Memorial Building host the offices of the Architect of the Capitol , which is responsible for a masonry shop, carpentry shop, and machine rooms used for the maintenance of the Capitol buildings, plus a bodega. The Capitol subway system also received upgrades and improvements , first in the form of a monorail to replace the Studebakers, which eventually gave way to more traditional light rail links. Starting in 1960, additional subway lines were added to cover other Congressional offices beyond the Russell building. Today, it has links to the Dirksen and Hart Senate Office Buildings, as well as the Rayburn House Office Building. Rayburn also notably contains a gym for legislators and a shooting range for the U.S. Capitol Police . In addition, it has long been apparent that the tunnels also offer a valuable way for individuals to get out of various buildings in a crisis, or a place where they can shelter, if necessary. In 1958, the U.S. government designated the tunnel between the Capitol and the Russell building a fallout shelter, according to the Washington Tunnels project . Security posture changes following the shooting of two Capitol Police officers by a man suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in 1998 also led to the closure of many of the tunnels to the general public as a safety precaution. The last major spate of underground work around Capitol Hill, at least that we know of, was part of a major expansion of the Capitol building complex in the 2000s. A three-story, 580,000-square-foot underground addition was dug out immediately to the east with new subterranean links to various surrounding office buildings. This work included a large tunnel stretching more than 1,000 feet to the northwest. This passage is ostensibly a route for garbage trucks, allowing them to be screened by security personnel to make sure they haven’t been turned into improvised weapons at a safer distance from the seat of America’s legislature. A picture showing work on the garbage truck tunnel in 2003., Architect of the Capitol However, the Washington Tunnels project has noted that after the tunnel’s completion in the 2000s, the Architect of the Capitol appeared to systematically remove all press releases and pictures relating to its construction from its website, though that information remains readily accessible online elsewhere. This could indicate that it has more sensitive functions, including as a designated route to evacuate members of Congress and other VIPs from the Capitol during a crisis, which wouldn’t necessarily be surprising. During the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Vice President Pence and at least some members of Congress were rushed out of the building via unspecified tunnels. “We were down in the basement and navigated the tunnels, and there was confusion as to where they wanted us,” Representative Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, said afterward . “A handful of us went to the cafeteria, which was locked down, and they let us in.” After leaving, at least some of those individuals were relocated to the U.S. Army’s Fort McNair in Washington. Fort McNair is known to be part of Continuity of Government plans , which are in place to ensure that the U.S. government can continue to function during various kinds of contingencies. The “garbage tunnel” would have provided at least one very clear route for vehicles to drive straight under the Capitol, pick up key government officials, and then drive right back out and head to McNair, which is around a mile-and-a-half by car to the south. It’s also worth noting that the Capitol complex tunnels are hardly the only ones linking U.S. government buildings in Washington, D.C., and the broader National Capital Region (NCR), not all of which are publicly disclosed. The White House, for instance, has its own maze of tunnels underneath. As with the Capitol, this includes one that is in regular use as a link to the offices in the neighboring Eisenhower Executive Office Building, also known as the Old Executive Building. The White House also has an underground pathway to allow vehicles to come in and out discreetly that has its entrance at the back of the Treasury Department Annex two blocks away. The origins of that subterranean passage trace back to the period immediately after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when an initial tunnel was dug between the White House and the Treasury Department to provide a more hardened means of escape in the event of a surprise aerial raid on the nation’s capital. At the same time, work began on an actual bunker underneath the White House, which has since evolved into the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC). A new massive bunker was built below the White House lawn during the Obama Administration, as well. You can read about the PEOC and this new facility in this past War Zone piece . Camp David also has a large subterranean bunker. In the 1960s, the Pentagon actively explored building a massive super bunker underneath Washington that would have been connected to it, as well as the White House and the State Department’s headquarters, plans that you can read about more in this previous War Zone story . Then-Vice President Dick Cheney, seated at center, in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC), on Sept. 11, 2001., US Government image There are other large Continuity of Government sites relatively nearby. These are the Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley and the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in the Appalachian Mountains near Blue Ridge Summit in southern Pennsylvanian. You can read more about these facilities, as well as other underground government construction projects in the nation’s capital and elsewhere across the country, in these past War Zone features . There are various other types of underground tunnels in the nation’s capital, too, some of which date back centuries and are no longer publicly accessible. There are aqueducts, sewers, and steam tunnels, as well as various transportation-related tunnels, such as the ones for the Metro subway system. Some old disused streetcar tunnels, first built in the early part of the 20th Century, have since been repurposed for other uses, including as venues for art exhibitions and music performances . The value of having all this infrastructure was made clear this week with the storming of the Capitol, in which one woman was shot by a Capitol Police officer. Another Capitol Police officer died from injuries sustained during the events. Three other individuals died from what have been referred to as “medical emergencies,” but there reports that at least some of those might have been someone who was crushed to death under the stampeding mob. Many more security personnel and members of the pro-Trump crowd were injured during the incident and there are strong indications that the violence could have been much worse. An officer from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) helps clean up the Capitol after a pro-Trump mob had been cleared out on Jan. 6, 2021., AP Photo/Andrew Harnik “These individuals actively attacked United States Capitol Police Officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and took up other weapons against our officers.” Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who is now set to resign amid serious questions about his force’s handling of the situation, had said in a press release on Jan. 7. “They were determined to enter the Capitol Building by causing great damage.” In the immediate aftermath of the siege at the Capitol this week, additional security measures are already being taken, including the erection of temporary fencing around the entire complex. Hopefully, we won’t see anything like what happened on Jan. 6 again any time soon, but if another incident like that occurs, the tunnels underneath Capitol Hill will remain just as important pathways for individuals looking to make their way to safety as this did in this case.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 3, 2021",This Stretched Super FB-111 Was A Low-Cost Challenger To The B-1 Bomber,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For most of its career with the U.S. Air Force, the FB-111A, Strategic Air Command’s version of the F-111 Aardvark , was pretty much unloved. After a troubled path to service, the tactical F-111 eventually became one of the most capable strike aircraft of the Cold War, while the FB-111 fulfilled a requirement for a supplemental bomber to augment Strategic Air Command, only 76 examples being built to provide a stopgap until a next-generation bomber became available. However, with the cancelation of the original B-1 bomber program in 1977, another opportunity suddenly emerged for the FB-111, or a derivative thereof, to shine. To take the place of the larger, more advanced bomber, the Air Force started looking at a much-improved “Super FB-111,” and the idea lingered on until the B-1 program was finally revived under the Reagan Administration in 1981, resulting in today’s B-1B Lancer . General Dynamics, the FB-111A’s manufacturer, had already begun studies to enhance the aircraft in 1974, hoping to address the limited range and payload that dogged an aircraft that hadn’t originally been designed for the strategic mission and which Strategic Air Command found itself operating more or less against its will. One of the 76 original FB-111As undergoes flight-line maintenance. , U.S. Air Force Development of a reworked, stretched-fuselage version of the FB-111A, eventually known as the FB-111H, initially took place secretly within General Dynamics, since the U.S. Department of Defense remained committed to the more ambitious B-1. The firm invested almost $10 million of discretionary funds on the studies, including 800 hours spent evaluating wind-tunnel models, plus completion of a quarter-scale model used to assess the radar cross-section at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant. President Jimmy Carter had different plans for the B-1, which he canceled in June 1977, describing it as “a very expensive weapon” that was “not now necessary” because of the “recent evolution of the cruise missile.” For a brief moment, at least, the concept of a penetrating bomber — one that relied primarily on speed to get to its target, rather than lobbing cruise missiles from a safe standoff distance — was dead. Just two-and-a-half months after the ax fell on the B-1, the House Appropriations Committee began to look at alternatives to the stillborn B-1. These included simply resuming work on the B-1, developing an all-new B-X penetrating bomber, a rebuilt and upgraded B-52X penetrating bomber design, adapting B-52s into more capable cruise missile carriers, converting commercial or military widebody aircraft into launch platforms for cruise missiles, and the FB-111H. Also, among all these options, the Carter administration was also secretly pushing ahead with stealth technology, including the Advanced Technology Bomber and F-117 Nighthawk , some of the early history of which you can read about here . Although the House of Representatives still preferred the B-1, in September 1977 the Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $20-million budget for Fiscal Year 1978 to study the FB-111H. The argument was that this aircraft would be able to match the B-1 in almost every aspect of performance, apart from its weapons payload, which would be roughly half that of the larger bomber. It was envisaged that the first FB-111H could be converted from an FB-111A and take to the air within two years, followed by a second prototype six months later. Standard U.S. Air Force FB-111As in formation., U.S. Air Force General Dynamics subsequently developed a test plan for these two aircraft. It was planned to use the first to evaluate propulsion, performance, stability and control, flutter, flight load, and stores separation. The second would be utilized for tests of the electronic countermeasures system, terrain-following radar, and the navigation/bombing system. Then, once these two airframes had been successfully proven, another 65 examples would be converted from other FB-111As, before General Dynamics would reopen the production line to produce another 100 new-build versions. This 167-aircraft fleet was anticipated to cost $7 billion, providing a unit price of $42.1 million, which was less than half the expected cost of each B-1A. Beyond that, there was the possibility that more FB-111Hs could be ordered beyond this total, allowing the swing-wing bomber to finally fulfill its full potential as a key component of Strategic Air Command’s fleets and potentially replacing aging B-52s as well. An artist’s concept of the FB-111H revealing the revised engine intakes and tail section., U.S. Air Force While it would retain 43 percent structural commonality with the FB-111A, and 79 percent of its subsystems were to be similar to the ones found in that earlier design, the H-model was expected to look significantly different from the basic Aardvark. Its stretched fuselage would accommodate new engines, additional fuel capacity, and an enlarged weapons bay, resulting in reconfigured landing gear and entirely different air intakes, which would be fixed rather than the variable-geometry design that The War Zone has looked at in detail in the past. The F-111/FB-111’s unique crew escape module was to be retained. The powerplant would be a pair of General Electric F101 turbofans, the same engines used in the original B-1As and the later B-1Bs, each of which was rated at 30,000 pounds of thrust at full afterburner. Visitors attending the rollout ceremony for the first production B-1B examine a model of an F101 turbofan., U.S. Air Force The variable-geometry wings would retain the same 70-foot span when fully spread as earlier F-111 variants, but would now be able to sweep back to only 60 degrees, compared to 72.5 degrees on the FB-111A. This would eliminate the low-level supersonic “dash” capability, but the H-model was still expected to be able to hit Mach 0.95 at sea level. Performance-wise, the FB-111H was planned to reach a speed of Mach 1.6 above 36,000 feet, a cruise speed of Mach 0.75, and a low-altitude penetration speed of Mach 0.85 flying at 200 feet. This would be slower than the FB-111A, which could hit Mach 2.2, but the tradeoff was judged acceptable to boost range and weapons carriage. The enlarged fuselage would add another 104 inches in length, making the aircraft 88 feet 2.5 inches long compared to the FB-111A’s 73 feet 6 inches. Weights were to be increased proportionally, including an empty weight of 51,832 pounds and a maximum inflight weight of 155,000 pounds. The same figures for the FB-111A were 116,115 pounds and 122,900 pounds, respectively. To allow truly strategic range, internal fuel would have to be doubled, growing to a whopping 64,000 pounds. It was in terms of range that the FB-111H would have offered a real advance over the FB-111A. While its predecessor could fly 5,300 nautical miles, the FB-111H would have increased this figure by 44 percent, for a range of 7,632 nautical miles. In both cases, this envisaged a mission profile that included the aid of aerial refueling, a 1,200-nautical-mile high-speed dash at low level, and carriage of two internal nuclear weapons. What is more, the FB-111H would be able to match the range of the FB-111A when carrying three times the payload. A 509th Bombardment Wing FB-111 aircraft, bottom, and a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft conduct aerial refueling during a flight out of Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire., U.S. Air Force Those weapons were to be carried in a bomb bay that was almost doubled in size, allowing four or five nuclear weapons to be carried instead of two. There would also be external hardpoints, too, 12 in all, including six that were below and on the sides of the air intakes, not dissimilar to those later found on the F-15E Strike Eagle . While the FB-111A could carry a maximum of six nuclear weapons, this revised design was expected to haul 15. These would be either freefall bombs or AGM-69 Short-Range Attack Missiles (SRAMs), the latter being a Cold War-era defense-suppression weapon that you can read more about here . An AGM-69 training round is maneuvered under a B-1B., U.S. Air Force The avionics and self-defense suite for the FB-111H was expected to benefit considerably from equipment that had been developed for the B-1 and would have included an AN/APQ-144 radar, a modified AN/APQ-134 terrain-following radar, AN/APN-200 Doppler Velocity Sensor, AN/AJN-16 and SKN-2400 Inertial Navigation Systems, dual CP-2A computers, AN/ALQ-131 and AN/ALQ-137 electronic warfare jammers, AN/ALQ-153/154 tail warning radar, AN/ALR-62 radar warning receivers, and AN/ALE-28 chaff/flare dispensers. Aside from its cost, projected performance, and, at least compared to the FB-111A, its payload, there were other factors that made the FB-111H an attractive proposition for the Air Force. Despite its mission with Strategic Air Command, the FB-111A was not classed as a strategic asset and the same would be the case for the FB-111H, preventing it from being subject to restrictions that might be imposed by future Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreements or similar arms control deals with the Soviet Union. In the same way that the Soviet Union argued that the Tu-22M Backfire was a non-strategic asset, the United States could have likely done the same for the FB-111H, pointing out that it was merely a derivative of the F-111/FB-111. However, the Senate Committee’s decision to pursue the FB-111H instead of the B-1 drew the wrath of members of the House Appropriations Committee. They made the case that the Carter administration had informed them that the penetrating bomber had no future and yet now another penetrating bomber was being approved. In late October 1977, the House of Representatives overruled the FB-111H study budget that the Senate had proposed and instead fought to get the B-1 back on track. The FB-111H, however, was not entirely dead and lawmakers agreed it could be revived at a later date if a case could be made to reassign funds. Writing about the FB-111H at the time , Dr. Harold Brown, U.S. Secretary of Defense, noted: “Our analysis showed no significant advantage in cost or effectiveness over the B-1. That being the case, coupled with the added uncertainties of — and time required for —development, there was little purpose in pursuing an option that at best would be roughly equal to what we already have in hand. However, now that we have canceled production of the B-1, it may turn out that beginning in a few years from now it will be less expensive to maintain some version of the FB-111 as an option for an advanced penetrator than the B-1.” A prototype B-1A accompanied by an F-111 chase plane in January 1983., U.S. Air Force Although no recommendations were made to fund the FB-111H in the fiscal years to come, by late 1979 the Air Force was revisiting the idea of a reworked FB-111, with proposed variants known as the FB-111B/C. It is not entirely clear how these proposed variants differed from each other, but it may have been a matter of alternative avionics, other minor differences in the overall designs, or the starting variants from which they were to be converted. Regardless, this plan looked again at stretching FB-111As to accommodate more fuel and weapons and re-engining them with F-101s. The gross takeoff weight for the FB-111B variant, at least, was to be 140,000 pounds. Projected weapons loads were broadly similar to the FB-111H. It was expected that these aircraft would penetrate to the target area flying at below 200 feet and at a speed of Mach 0.85. A total of 66 FB-111As would be converted to the new configuration under the revised proposal, which would then be joined by 89 more modified F-111Ds . Those latter aircraft would be similarly modified after their transfer from Tactical Air Command. It was estimated that the FB-111B/Cs could be operational by 1983, with all of the planned aircraft modified into these new configurations by 1985. Since the FB-111B/C program would involve no new-build production, it was potentially cheaper than the previous FB-111H project and the Strategic Air Command leader General Richard Ellis described it as: “the best near-term solution to the penetrating bomber problem.” The FB-111B/C was still on the agenda in 1981, but in October of that year, the newly elected President Ronald Reagan took the bold step both to resurrect the B-1 — now as the somewhat more modest B-1B, optimized for low-level missions — as well as invest in the future B-2 stealth bomber . The first production B-1B aircraft outside a hangar at the Rockwell International Corporation facility in Palmdale, California., U.S. Air Force The FB-111’s loss was the B-1’s gain and those latter bombers remain workhorses of the Air Force, despite repeated plans to retire them and other well-publicized problems with the fleet. Had the FB-111H — or indeed the FB-111B/C — been procured, it’s difficult to know how they would have fared long-term, although they would not have been able to match B-1B’s much-vaunted ability to carry conventional weapons, and huge numbers of them. Putting aside the smaller payload, the improved variants of the FB-111 could have been relatively low-cost, plentiful assets that might even still have been around to undertake the kinds of long-range force-projection missions that the B-1B regularly flies today, or even received a conventional role post-Cold War. An aircraft with that kind of ‘regional bomber’ unrefueled range and large payload could have proven very useful in the post-Cold War age. As it is, the FB-111 in general is destined to be remembered as a Cold War bomber that never quite cemented its place in the Air Force’s strategic branch.

Brett Tingley,"Updated on Dec 15, 2020",Here Is What Happened The Last Time The U.S. Capitol Was Stormed Over Two Centuries Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol came under siege for several tense hours as supporters of President Donald Trump attempted to disrupt the joint session of Congress that had convened to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. The Capitol went under lockdown as security forces, including Capitol Police and FBI strike teams, cleared the building and restored order. By the time the facility and its surrounding grounds were secured, four people had lost their lives and dozens of others were injured. It had been over 200 years since the last storming of the Capitol, which occurred during the War of 1812. At the height of that conflict, British troops fought their way up the Patuxent River, eventually making their way into Washington, where they burned several government buildings, including the Capitol. To help contextualize yesterday’s disgraceful and unprecedented events, here’s a look back at what happened the last time the seat of American democracy came under siege. British Burn the Capitol, 1814, Allyn Cox, Public domain In the early 1800s, a conflict began brewing between America and Great Britain. Britain was implementing several naval policies that heavily restricted trade by the fledgling United States. These included harassing ships at sea and even forcibly conscripting American sailors to serve in the British Navy. The United Kingdom also aided Native American tribes in their resistance against America’s westward expansion. When James Madison was elected president in 1808, he instructed Congress to begin preparing for another war with Britain. Congress would vote to declare war against the British on June 18, 1812, and fighting began in July when American forces invaded Canada, which was at that time a British colony. Those forces would be beaten back, but the fighting would continue for over two more years. On August 24, 1814, British troops led by Major General Robert Ross marched into Washington City (now Washington D.C.) after defeating American forces at the Battle of Bladensburg, one of the worst defeats in American military history. Attempting to hold them off was a ragtag band of between 6,000 and 9,000 hastily-mustered and poorly-trained American militiamen and a few hundred seasoned regular army troops under the command of Brigadier General William Winder. The American forces, despite their greater numbers, were easily defeated due to several tactical errors, coupled with the skill of British sharpshooters and the British use of Congreve rockets , a crude, early form of rocket-propelled grenade. In addition to the damage they inflicted, just the violent sight and sound of the rockets drove American forces back in terror. Casualties on both sides were relatively light during the battle, but American forces fled in disarray, leaving Washington nearly undefended. With a clear path to Washington in front of them, Rear Admiral George Cockburn ordered close to 4,000 British redcoats and Royal Marines to march on the American capital. 1876 wood burning titled “Capture and Burning of Washington by the British, in 1814”, Public Domain As British troops approached Washington, Ross used his drummers to play a parley, a drumbeat meant to signify a request for the American leaders to discuss terms of surrender and/or truce. When no American commanders returned the offer, Ross and Cockburn marched into Washington with no intention of razing the city. However, after snipers fired upon British officers, the decision was then made to burn buildings, but only those belonging to the American government, to send a clear signal that British grievances were with U.S. authorities, not the American public. In all, British sappers burned 10 government buildings including the Department of War building, the Treasury, the Executive Mansion, and the Capitol. The Executive Mansion, now known as the White House, was painted white in 1817 to hide the scorch marks left behind by the blaze. The Capitol was still under construction at the time, but British troops found enough furniture and documents and brought enough gunpowder to quickly set the interior of the building alight. The entire Library of Congress – at the time consisting of 3,000 books – made for a fast-burning fire that spread to the Senate Chamber. The United States Capitol after the burning of Washington, D.C. in the War of 1812. Watercolor and ink depiction from 1814, restored., Munger, George/Library of Congress While much of the Capitol was constructed of fireproof materials, such as iron, marble, and sandstone, the blaze inside did burn hot enough to melt glass skylights, destroy sculptures, and heavily damage much of the architecture. Some of the fires burned so quickly and fiercely that the British were forced to retreat from the flames, sparing several areas of the facility. On August 25, 1814, a thunderstorm brought heavy rains down on Washington, dousing the flames set by invading British troops the day before. Several of the original sandstone architectural elements survived the fire, however, and can still be seen in the Capitol today. When the rain subsided, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage had been done to the U.S. Capitol, according to Superintendent of the Public Buildings of the City of Washington, Thomas Munroe. The President’s House by George Munger, 1814-1815, Public Domain On December 24, 1814, representatives of both sides of the conflict signed the Treaty of Ghent, named after the city in what was then the United Netherlands (today part of Belgium), where the ceremony took place. The deal effectively restored the pre-war status quo and saw the return of territory that the two countries had occupied during the course of the fighting. The news of the agreement famously did reach U.S. forces under the command of future President Andrew Jackson before they won the Battle of New Orleans on February 12, 1815. The U.S. government did not formally ratify the treaty until February of that year, as well. Reconstruction of the Capitol subsequently began late in 1815, with the help of military engineers, and would continue until 1826. The Capitol would later be expanded with new wings in 1850, while its recognizable dome was added in 1855 during another expansion. In 1958, yet another major expansion was added to the East Portico. The 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Trump may not have damaged the building to anywhere near the extent of the Burning of Washington in 1814, but the fact that mobs of protestors were able to storm the Capitol and breach Congressional offices will no doubt be remembered for centuries to come and have lasting effects on how security is handled in our nation’s capital for some time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 20, 2021",Pelosi Wants To Prevent “Unhinged” Trump From Launching A Nuclear Strike. Here’s The Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has issued a statement that raises, in no uncertain terms, concerns about President Donald Trump’s continued authority to launch a nuclear strike in the last weeks of his term in office. This follows growing calls for Trump’s resignation, impeachment for a second time, or removal via the 25th Amendment following an unprecedented assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, which had been whipped up in part by the president’s own rhetoric, earlier this week. You can read more about those events, which took place as members of Congress met to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, in The War Zone ‘s own recent reporting . Speaker Pelosi, a California Democrat, made the comments about Trump’s access to the country’s nuclear codes in a statement to other members of her party in the House of Representatives on Jan. 8, 2020. That missive also included a call to keep protecting American democracy, a demand to remove Trump from office immediately, remarks about the death of a Capitol Police officer during the events earlier in the week, and information about resources for members who might now be coping with the trauma of the siege. Today, Pelosi is also set to meet with the House Democratic caucus with a view to launching new impeachment proceedings against the President before he leaves office on January 20. US Air Force personnel inside a launch control facility during an exercise simulating the launch of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles., USAF “This morning, I spoke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [U.S. Army General] Mark Milley to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike,” Pelosi wrote regarding the nuclear strike issue. “The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy.” General Milley’s office has confirmed the call. “Speaker Pelosi initiated a call with the Chairman. He answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority,” a spokesperson told Military.com ‘s Gina Harkins. The Associated Press has also reported that a “top military official,” likely a reference to Milley, “assured her steps are in place to prevent Trump nuclear launch.” However, while Pelosi’s remarks underscore very significant concerns, there appear to be, at best, limited roadblocks to any President ordering a nuclear strike under the National Command Authority (NCA). The NCA is the current mechanism through which a nuclear strike would be initiated, something you can read more about here . It is important to note immediately that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including its Chairman, Milley, is primarily a military advisory body to the President, as well as the National Security Council, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security. Milley and his colleagues are not even in the chain of command that would be used to carry out a nuclear strike. “The President does not need the concurrence of either his military advisors or the U.S. Congress to order the launch of nuclear weapons,” a report the Congressional Research Service released in December on nuclear command and control says bluntly “In addition, neither the military nor Congress can overrule these orders.” “Questions about the legality of the order—whether it is consistent with the requirements, under the laws of armed conflict (LOAC), for necessity, proportionality, and distinction—are more likely to lead to consultations and changes in the President’s order than to a refusal by the military to execute the order,” it continues. “In this sense, addressing legal questions about an order to use nuclear weapons would seem similar to the process used for evaluating any employment order from the President.” At any given time, there is an officer just a few dozen feet away from the President carrying a secure communications device, known colloquially as the “ nuclear football .” The Command-in-Chief can issue nuclear strike orders via this system after inputting the top-secret codes they carry at all times on a card known as the “biscuit.” There is a predetermined “menu” of strike options is available and the President can also immediately seek the advice of the military attaché with the football, who is fully briefed on the pre-planned options and their expected effects. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff US Army General Mark Milley., Alex Brandon, STF / Associated Press The matters of the proportionality of the response and adherence to the LOAC have long been understood to be the only real checks on a U.S. nuclear strike, something The War Zone has explored in detail previously, including through the examination of declassified operations plans . The U.S. government notably does not have a “no first use” policy when it comes to its nuclear arsenal and reserves the right to employ these weapons in response to grave, but conventional threats. In addition, in the last year, the U.S. military has fielded new lower-yield warheads on its Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles loaded onto its Ohio class ballistic missile submarines , which have raised separate concerns about whether the threshold for ordering a nuclear strike has been lowered, a debate you can read more about in these past War Zone pieces . This is more or less the reality that was outlined in a public Senate hearing on this very issue in 2017. Senators had discussed the authorities at play for more than two hours with retired U.S. Air Force General C. Robert Kehler, who had previously served as head of U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), as well as former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Brian McKeon and Duke University Professor of Political Science and Public Policy Dr. Peter D. Feaver. As The War Zone wrote at the time : Robust plans to maintain a so-called “ continuity of government ” in a crisis, something we at The War Zone have previously explored in depth , means that even if something happened to the president or other senior officials, this sole authority is always in the hands of a single individual. A mechanism known as the National Command Authority (NCA) does require the Secretary of Defense to confirm the order, but does not allow them to actively veto it. As such, the president can continue to fire and designate individuals to perform that function until someone approves the strike. The longer officials might attempt to dissuade the command in chief, the less time they would have to react to any incoming threats, though. … The established protocol essentially accepts the lack of any real check and balance beyond the president asking for and accepting the counsel of their closest advisers as necessary for the United States to offer a realistic threat of massive retaliation. At the same time, though, American military commanders are supposed to have the inherent right to refuse any orders they feel are unlawful. As already noted, the official U.S. military nuclear attack plan makes it clear that the strikes have to be in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, which requires any military action to be proportional to the hostile threat and to take all reasonable steps to avoid civilian casualties. During the hearing, retired General Kehler said that had he received the order to launch a nuclear strike, but believed it to be lacking in legal justification, that he would have consulted his own advisers as to how to proceed. But since the United States is the only country to have ever used the weapons in anger and has only done so twice, there is no precedent whatsoever for how this might play out in an actual crisis. “Then what happens?” Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Kehler to try to clarify the hypothetical chain of events and understand if the retired officer was truly implying he might have actually disobeyed the command. “I don’t know,” Kehler said to nervous laughter from the assembled Senators. The concerns that prompted that hearing are similar to the ones Pelosi has spoken to now in her statement. At that time, President Trump had made multiple threats to North Korea implying the potential use of nuclear weapons. “Let me pull back the cover for a minute from this hearing,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, had told the assembled panel. “We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests.” The fear then, as now, is that Trump could order a nuclear strike that some might see as outside the realm of more expected scenarios, such as massive retaliation in response to an incoming nuclear attack on the United States, but is nevertheless determined to be technically legal. Any such situation could be made more complex depending on the exact nature of and timing of the order, which might very well be a reaction to a real crisis of some kind. There notably remain concerns about potential attacks on U.S. interests in the Middle East or elsewhere by Iran or its proxies that could prompt calls for a military response of some kind. All told, it remains unclear what assurances Milley actually gave Pelosi during his recent call with her. It’s not clear, within the scope of the available authorities, what any part of the U.S. military may really be prepared to do or be capable of doing, outside of mass insubordination. “I will follow any legal order that I’m given – I will not follow any illegal orders,” U.S. Navy Charles Richard, head of STRATCOM, told reporters the day before the siege on Capitol Hill, in response to question about potential nuclear strikes on Iran. “And if you go much further, if I were to say anything else, we’re starting to call in civilian control of the military, which I think is a prized American attribute.” “Fundamentally, who has the authority to do that is a political question,” he continued. “If you ask me my best military advice, the system we have served us well, for 70 years. I don’t recommend any changes, but I’m prepared to execute whatever the political leadership of this nation would like to do.” Still, simply slow-rolling the process might be one option to avert a potential nuclear strike. Then-President Richard Nixon was also presented with the option of a nuclear strike on North Korea in retaliation for that country shooting down an American spy plane over international waters in 1969. There is a distinct possibility that delays in presenting that and other possible courses of action to Nixon gave time for tempers to cool. No strike on North Korea, nuclear or conventional, was ultimately carried out and Nixon received praise for his restraint. Just how real the risk is of Trump ordering a nuclear strike under suspect circumstances is unclear, as well. Though Trump is certainly a very different individual from Nixon, he has already received accolades in the past for a similar decision not to strike Iran after that country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down a U.S. Navy RQ-4 Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) drone flying in international airspace in 2019. “The nuclear launch codes are literally in Donald Trump’s pocket, and as President he has the full legal authority to order a nuclear strike at any time. Every minute Trump maintains his authority as commander-in-chief is another moment of peril for the United States and the world,” Bruce Blair, a former U.S. Air Force missile launcher officer and a co-founder of Global Zero , which advocates for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons around the world, said after Pelosi’s statement became public. “Ordering a nuclear strike may seem far-fetched, but until yesterday many would have said the same about a U.S. President inciting a mob to attack and terrorize the halls of government.” With Democrats now poised to take control of the office of the President, as well as both chambers of Congress, this month, we may well see new movement to find ways to curtail the Command-in-Chief’s nuclear authority, while still preserving America’s nuclear deterrent posture, later this year.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 15, 2020",The Age Of Swarming Air-Launched Munitions Has Officially Begun With Air Force Test,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force has dropped Small Diameter Bombs modified to incorporate swarming technology as part of the service’s Golden Horde program for the first time. The ultimate aim of this effort is to develop artificial intelligence-driven systems that could allow the networking together of various types of precision munitions into an autonomous swarm . The test, which took place on Dec. 15, 2020, but which was only publicly announced today , was carried out by a team from the U.S. Air Force Test Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida using an F-16 Viper fighter jet from that base’s 96th Test Wing. The aircraft dropped two specially-configured Collaborative Small Diameter Bombs (CSDB) during the experiment. The Air Force’s Golden Horde program is developing technology that the service could use to turn precision-guided munitions, such as these GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs, into networked swarms., USAF “The Golden Horde demonstration with the Small Diameter Bomb flights is an important step on the path to Networked Collaborative Weapon systems,” Chris Ristich, Director of AFRL’s Transformational Capabilities Office, said. “Completion of this first mission sets the stage for further development and transition to the warfighter.” The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is overseeing the Golden Horde program, with Scientific Applications & Research Associates , Inc. (SARA) under contract to develop the actual technology underpinning the effort. The CSDBs appear to be modified versions of the GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bomb (LSDB), with the laser seeker of that weapon replaced by a new nose section with the Golden Horde technology. The standard LSDB also has the same GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System (INS) guidance option as the standard SDB. After the F-16 released the two test bombs, they “quickly established communication with each other and their seekers detected a GPS jammer,” according to AFRL. An artist’s conception of the GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bomb (LSDB)., Boeing The GPS jammer was one of a number of potential targets that had been arrayed on the test range. The official Air Force news item on the test described the full mission as such: During the mission, the weapons referred to pre-defined Rules of Engagement (RoEs), a set of constraints preloaded by a mission planner, and determined that the jammer was not the highest priority target. The weapons then collaborated to identify the two highest priority targets. However, due to an improper weapon software load, the collaboration guidance commands were not sent to the weapon navigation system. Without the updated target locations, the weapons impacted a fail-safe target location. So, while not a complete success, in that the weapons failed to impact the simulated high-priority targets, the test nonetheless provided the first practical evaluation of the Golden Horde program. Another two CSDB flight tests are planned for early this year, ultimately employing four rather than two collaborative weapons in each mission. “I’m very pleased with the results of this first test,” said Steven Stockbridge, the Golden Horde Principal Investigator. “The team saw a good performance from the networked collaborative sub-systems and understand the root cause of the weapons not impacting the desired targets. We anticipate readiness for the next flight test.” Golden Horde is focused on developing what the Air Force is calling “networked, collaborative, and autonomous” weapon capabilities, or NCA, and will involve both live and virtual testing. Ultimately, the plan is to field NCA-enabled weapons that will be able to share information and work together collaboratively in a swarm to best overwhelm hostile air defenses and make it to their otherwise intended targets. This requires the weapons not only to “talk” to each other, but also to sense and react to changes in the battlespace in real-time. A US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle carrying 20 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs. With technology being developed now through Golden Horde, an aircraft with this loadout might eventually be able to launch these weapons as a single autonomous swarm., USAF In this first test, the NCA package inside the CSDBs included “a home-on-GPS-jam seeker that gathers information about the battlespace, a software-defined radio for communication between weapons, and a processor preloaded with collaborative algorithms,” according to the Air Force. The service compares the collaborative algorithms used in the NCA concept to a quarterback calling a play in football. Each “play” relates to an established behavior for a swarm of collaborative weapons, depending on the conditions in which they find themselves. Since the weapons use autonomous technology, their responses will only be in line with those prescribed in the preloaded algorithms, or “list of plays.” This kind of capability sounds very similar to what Boeing demonstrated with its Decision Mission-Control Software (DICE) during testing of the X-45A unmanned aircraft nearly two decades ago, which you can read about more in this past War Zone feature . It’s also interesting to note that the “home-on-GPS-jam seeker” used in the CSDBs would seem to imply the existence of a previously undisclosed anti-radiation version of the GBU-39/B with a guidance system capable of zeroing in on a target radio-frequency emissions. If this SDB variant doesn’t already exist, this would certainly make clear that it is a viable future guidance option for the weapon. “This successful Golden Horde demonstration builds the foundation for integrating this technology into a variety of other weapon systems, which will help the U.S. maintain a technological advantage over our adversaries,” said Air Force Colonel Garry Haase, Director of AFRL’s Munitions Directorate. While the Air Force doesn’t appear to have any present plans to field the CSDBs themselves as operational weapons, further developments of the technology that it is now trialing as part of the Golden Horde program could well find its way into frontline weapons. The AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), as well as the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy , have both been mentioned in the past as potential candidates for this swarming technology. Inert AGM-158 JASSMs loaded onto a B-52H bomber., USAF Networked together in a swarm, cruise missiles, such as the AGM-158, could engage targets across a broad area more effectively, prioritizing targets in real-time and even accounting for ones that suddenly emerge, such as pop-up air defense threats, while they’re in flight. As well as the increased capability to destroy targets more efficiently, the technology being developed under Golden Horde could potentially allow weapons to be launched into a general area without a specific target or targets identified in advance. This same kind of real-time prioritization would be immensely valuable for decoys, such as the ADM-160, or air-launched stores capable of non-kinetic attacks, including ones carrying electronic warfare jammers . A better understanding of the battlepsace through networking would also simply help autonomous weapons cover a designated area in the most efficient manner within pre-programmed mission perameters. The Golden Horde technology could also provide particularly impressive effects when combined with munitions, such as the GBU-53/B StormBreaker , previously known as the Small Diameter Bomb II, that feature multi-mode targeting systems. Weapons with multi-mode seekers are already immensely flexible against a wide variety of targets, including ones in motion, in various kinds of environments. A networked swarm with these capabilities would therefore have even more ways to find targets and determine the best way to sort and engage them. A GBU-53/B StormBreaker loaded onto an F-15E Strike Eagle during a test., Raytheon In 2019, the Air Force also notably announced that it was canceling its Gray Wolf program , which had been focused on the development of technology to support the development of a low-cost cruise missile, in order to refocus those resources into Golden Horde. At the same time, the service said that the initial phases of Gray Wolf had also been used to explore networked munition concepts and that it would leverage at least some of the work done under that project to support Golden Horde. The development of advanced, but low-cost munitions is a key tangential requirement to ensure that future expendable weapons swarms do not become prohibitively expensive. Though the Gray Wolf program has been curtailed, the Air Force has still been separately working toward a live-fire test of the experimental missile design that the project had produced. Members from the Gray Wolf test team and personnel from the 416th Flight Test Squadron stand behind a prototype Gray Wolf missile ahead of a captive-carry flight test in 2020., USAF All of this could help produce families of “smarter” and cheaper weapons that could also help further reduce the risk to the launching aircraft compared to the kind of precision-guided weapons available today by giving more authority to the munitions themselves to find and engage targets. Tactics wise, having the actual weapons work together to attack certain target sets autonomously could drastically increase their effectiveness, especially in highly defended airspace. As it stands now, the Air Force plans to conduct at least two more CSDB flight tests early this year. The goal is for at least one of these tests to involve the release of four of the weapons, rather than just two. This recent test of the first CSDBs already represents an important step forward in the development of exciting new air-launched swarming munitions capabilities that have the potential to totally change how aerial warfare is waged.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on May 11, 2021",The Iraqi Air Force’s F-16 Fleet Is On The Brink Of Collapse Despite Showy Flybys,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A total of 23 Iraqi Air Force Lockheed Martin F-16IQ Viper fighter jets took part in an impressive flyby to mark the centenary of the country’s army yesterday. This is despite recent reports that Baghdad’s fleet of F-16s, the pride of the country’s air force and arguably its most capable combat assets , is suffering from serious readiness problems. The flyby was part of a major military parade to commemorate 100 years of the Iraqi Army that was staged in Baghdad in the presence of the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kazemi. As well as fighters and helicopters, troops, and various military vehicles were presented to the country’s officials and the general public. A full video of the event is posted later in this article. A two-seat Iraqi F-16D begins to taxi at Balad Air Base, Iraq, in August 2018. , U.S. Army/Master Sgt. Horace Murray The Iraqi Air Force originally acquired 36 F-16C/D Block 52s, also known by the designation F-16IQ, under a 2011 Foreign Military Sales deal, but two of the jets were lost in separate accidents during their initial period of training in the United States. The remaining 34 Vipers are assigned to the 9th Fighter Squadron at Balad Air Base and have previously flown combat operations against ISIS as part of the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition, striking targets both in Iraq and in Syria . “The Iraqi Air Force F-16 pilots demonstrated their readiness in the Defeat Daesh mission,” said U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, the official military spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), said in a statement, using a colloquial name for ISIS. CJTF-OIR is the formal name for the U.S.-led coalition to fighting that terrorist group in Iraq and Syria. That vote of confidence from CJTF-OIR is noteworthy since it was reported only last month that the Iraqi F-16 fleet was no longer flying missions as part of the international coalition. That story was published online by the Iraq Oil Report , which specializes in news from and about Iraq. Video of the January 6, 2021 parade: The number of jets involved in the January 6 celebrations is also significant in light of previous accounts that suggested that less than 20 percent of Iraq’s F-16s were fully airworthy. The report , based on an investigation into the status of Balad Air Base, home of the Iraqi Air Force Viper fleet, contended that during one effort to get 19 jets into the air in the course of a single day last year, four of them “almost crashed,” apparently as the result of near-collisions. “The pilots were crying for help,” one unnamed former Iraqi Army official told Iraq Oil Report . “It was a huge risk.” The same story quotes active and retired members of the Iraqi military who describe “poor jet maintenance and mismanagement” leading to the F-16s regularly failing to meet required maintenance standards. Officials confirmed to the Iraq Oil Report last December that only seven jets from the F-16 fleet were able to fly “without serious risk of crashing,” while the operational jets were being kept airworthy using spare parts cannibalized from the other aircraft. This is clearly a short-term solution that will eventually lead to all aircraft becoming non-airworthy in the long-term. There was, however, some indirect pushback from CJTF-OIR in the wake of the article, with the following tweet — including an image of an Iraqi F-16 undergoing maintenance — posted around a week after the report was published: The poor state of the jets may well have been the reason — or at least a contributing factor — behind the decision to remove the F-16s from air tasking orders. This move, which occurred around April 2020, was confirmed to the Iraq Oil Report later in the year by one current and one former Iraqi Army officer and two coalition spokespersons from the U.S. military, including the coalition’s chief spokesperson, U.S. Army Colonel Wayne Marotto. Despite removal from the CJTF-OIR order of battle, the Iraqi Air Force did apparently fly two further sorties as part of the campaign, on September 1, 2020. However, it seems these were fairly tokenistic. One former Iraqi Army official told the Iraq Oil Report that the flights were “bullshit.” Further details on the status of the Iraqi Vipers have been published by the Scramble aviation website, which has reported that, of the 34 F-16s based at Balad, at least 10 “are not able to fly at all.” Of the 23 jets that took part in the flyby, Scramble says that more than half “are only able to fly but lack working radars and avionics to operate with weapons and show other shortcomings.” The website adds that within other Western air forces, jets in a similar status would simply be grounded. An Iraqi Air Force pilot conducts pre-flight inspections in an Iraqi F-16 during training at Tucson International Airport, Arizona, in 2014. The pilot was part of the first class of Iraqi students training with the 162nd Wing, U.S. Air Force., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jordan Castelan The problems faced by the Iraqis in keeping the F-16 fleet combat-ready are manyfold. Above all, logistical issues have affected aircraft availability, a knock-on effect of budget shortages due to the falling price of oil, together with the ongoing security situation in the country, which has led to a reduction in the Lockheed Martin-provided contractor support needed to properly maintain the jets. The lack of money to support the F-16s has led to Baghdad taking out a $2.7-billion loan from the United States to cover ammunition and maintenance for the jets, as well as to sustain its costly M1A1 Abrams. The Iraqi military has had increasing trouble operating and maintaining those main battle tanks, which it also acquired from the United States, as you can read about more here . There is also the factor of a limited number of fully trained crews to both fly and service the jets. In terms of pilots, a shortage of available jets on the flight line means fewer training sorties can be generated, with aircrew losing their qualifications for specific tasks, including undertaking combat missions, or night flying. Iraqi Air Force Captain Hama stands in front of one of the Iraqi F-16s at Tucson International Airport, Arizona. Hama helped deliver one of the new Iraqi F-16Ds to their training location in the United States., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jordan Castelan An example of the lack of oversight in maintenance was one incident last August in which a ground crew reduced from the standard four to just one person failed to properly secure an F-16 that was parked after a flight. It then rolled away and hit a maintenance vehicle, causing serious damage to the jet’s nose. The Iraq Oil Report also cited mismanagement and alleged corruption as factors behind the Iraqi F-16 fleet’s problems. That corruption was addressed in a previous article published by the same source, last August, pointing to “criminal schemes and failures of oversight” at Balad, including the example of commanders allegedly fabricating logbooks to exaggerate the number of training flights taking place. The surplus fuel left over was then apparently sold off illicitly. Since then, and despite an Iraqi Ministry of Defense investigation, the situation has reportedly only deteriorated. Meanwhile, the safety of U.S. contractors in Iraq has become an increasing concern in the last 12 months. ISIS has stepped up its activities in northern Iraq, including targeting individuals associated with oil fields and other energy infrastructure, as well as security forces. Lieutenant Colonel Julian Pacheco and Iraqi Air Force Captain Hama touch down in an F-16D at Tucson International Airport, Arizona in 2014., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Jordan Castelan The assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, then-commander of Iran’s Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport in January 2020 also led to a dramatic increase in threat levels in Iraq. Days after the drone strike, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched numerous ballistic missiles at the U.S. operated portions of air bases at Al Asad and Erbil, injuring 110 American service members. Moreover, the relationship between Iraq and the United States — and the U.S.-led coalition — has worsened since last year’s Baghdad Airport drone strike, which also claimed the life of Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, the then-deputy commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella organization overseeing semi-official militias mobilized to fight ISIS, which includes multiple Iranian-backed groups . With all this in mind, it seems that Lockheed Martin contractors were forced to leave Iraq in January 2020, although it’s unclear whether they left entirely, or left a reduced presence in the country. Reportedly, at least some Lockheed Martin maintenance contractors began returning to Balad Air Base in the summer “to complete the terms of their logistics support contract.” The inaugural F-16 Fighting Falcon for the Iraqi Air Force during its first flight from the Lockheed Martin plant at Fort Worth, Texas on May 7, 2014., Lockheed Martin At that point, however, the U.S. government threatened to close its Embassy in Baghdad if Iraq didn’t take action to prevent attacks against it . This again put into question the status of U.S. contractors in the country. “If Lockheed does follow the U.S. government’s lead to the exits, it would likely ensure the F-16 fleet is unable to rejoin the U.S.-led coalition anytime soon,” the Iraq Oil Report observed. “We continue to work closely with our security teams and government partners to monitor the situation,” a Lockheed Martin statement to Iraq Oil Report contended. “The safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority.” Liz Kaszynski/Lockheed Martin It seems that, despite the ability to put up 23 jets as a show of strength, the long-term fate of the Iraqi F-16 fleet hangs in the balance. Efforts to fly 19 or 23 jets in a single day may look impressive but are no guarantee of combat-readiness. There’s also the lingering question of whether Iraq even really needs aircraft in the class of the F-16. The Iraqi Air Force also operates cheaper Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) T-50 Golden Eagle advanced trainer/light combat aircraft that arguably provide much of the capability required to combat an enemy like ISIS. Also suitable for this type of counterinsurgency campaign are the air force’s subsonic Su-25 Frogfoot or Czech-made L-159 attack jets, which it has many years of experience operating, as well as turboprop-powered AC-208 Armed Caravans that can deliver AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Furthermore, the Mi-24 Hind and Mi-28 Havoc attack helicopters flown by the Iraqi Army, both of which are seen in the video below, are similarly equipped for this kind of mission and have seen extensive combat against ISIS. Even the Iraqi Air Force’s An-32 Cline transports, which have been adapted to operate as bombers, have at times seen more combat use than the F-16s, an anomaly that you can read about in detail here . Suffice to say, between June 2014, and December 2017, the An-32 cargo planes flew 990 strike missions, almost twice that of the Iraqi F-16 fleet’s 514 sorties. It is worth noting too that the Iraqi F-16 acquisition was controversial from the beginning, and export approval was only granted after the jets were suitable downgraded compared to other export variants, including removal of AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile capability, these weapons being substituted by less-capable AIM-7 Sparrows . Over and above this, an aircraft as sophisticated as the F-16 requires constant support from the original equipment manufacturer — in this case, Lockheed Martin — making the type arguably too sophisticated for the newly re-established Iraqi Air Force. Eight of the 23 F-16s involved in the January 6, 2021 flyby., CJTF-OIR Ultimately, unless the problems presented by economic constraints and the wider security situation, let alone alleged mismanagement and corruption, can be addressed, it may simply be a matter of time before the whole of the Iraqi Viper fleet is finally grounded for good.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The storming of the U.S. Capitol yesterday by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump, which you can read more about in The War Zone ‘s rolling coverage during that event , almost immediately produced a flurry of already iconic images. These include photographs of plainclothes police officers barricading the door to the floor of the House of Representatives with their Glock pistols drawn. On closer inspection, a number of those pistols have reflective red-and-white striped tape on the sides of their slides. There is an established practice of marking guns in similar ways to help members of security forces quickly identify each other and prevent friendly fire incidents in a chaotic situation, especially when there might be one or more active shooters present brandishing their own weapons. Police stand, guns drawn, at a barricade at a door to the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 6, 2021. One of them is holding a Glock pistol with red-and-white reflective tape on the side of the slide., AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite In regards to the use of reflective tape on the Glocks, we talked to Tomer Israeli , a former Chief Security Officer with the Israeli Secret Service, or Shin Bet, and who was also previously a member of the executive protection team for the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Tomer is now the head instructor at the Israeli Tactical School in Virginia, which provides training services for U.S. military and law enforcement groups, as well as security forces from around the world. Although he had no direct knowledge of the Capitol Police’s specific policies, he confirmed that the application of the tape is not a totally uncommon practice. It is used to differentiate “non-combatants from combatants in a crowded situation,” and helps officers make the right split-second decisions as to whether to engage a target or not. Crowded is certainly one way to describe what occurred yesterday when pro-Trump protesters forced their way inside the Capitol as members of Congress, along with Vice President Mike Pence, were in the process of certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump and many of his supporters claim the election was rife with fraud. We can’t tell from the photos what exact models of this popular pistol the officers were armed with, but we do know that the Capitol Police was issuing the Glock 22 , which is chambered for the .40 caliber Smith & Wesson cartridge, as of 2019. That year, one of the force’s members accidentally left one of these guns behind in a bathroom stall in the Capitol, an act of carelessness that has happened more than once in recent years. That also raises a possibility, albeit one that seems much less likely, that these tape markings could be some kind of method for quickly identifying misplaced guns as belonging to that force, rather than a weapon belonging to a potential criminal. A fourth-generation Glock 22., Glock USA The pictures from the House floor do show at least two Glocks with the highly-reflective candy-striped tape. It’s unclear why some of the pistols have the tape and others don’t. It’s also not clear if any of the plainclothes individuals may have been from other federal agencies, and therefore might have been carrying other Glock models without the tape. With Vice President Pence present, the U.S. Secret Service would also have had at least some personnel in the building at the beginning of the incident. We have reached to the Capitol Police for further information. Regardless, if the red-and-white striped tape is indeed a means of rapidly identifying other friendly law enforcement officers, it would make good sense. During a major security breach involving a large number of potentially hostile individuals, some of whom might be armed, additional and prominent visual cues showing who’s who could be extremely valuable. This would be even more true in situations where there are significant numbers of plainclothes officers present who might not otherwise be readily distinguishable from everyone else in the throng. If any active shooters had been present, there would have been an ever greater need to be able to quickly discern which individuals with guns drawn were friendly or not. On top of that, in this particular instance, personnel from numerous other federal and local law enforcement agencies — including officers and agents from the D.C. Metro Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. Park Police — subsequently flooded the Capitol. Elements of the Washington, D.C., and Virginia National Guards were also activated for deployment to support the response to the security breach. Other states have now sent National Guard units to the nation’s capital, as well. All of this would only have increased the potential for confusion and raised the risks of potentially deadly misidentification. There are already reports that the response to the security breach on Capitol Hill was itself chaotic and disorganized . It’s also worth noting that some of the protesters were even wearing camouflage clothing and military-style gear, themselves. Though thankfully, no friendly fire incidents occurred, a U.S. Capitol Police officer did fatally shoot a woman, now identified as Ashli Babbitt , as she attempted to get into a more heavily secured area inside the Capitol. As is standard practice, that officer is now on administrative leave pending an investigation into that shooting. Three other people died as a result of other “medical emergencies” over the course of yesterday’s events. “United States Capitol Police (USCP) officers and our law enforcement partners responded valiantly when faced with thousands of individuals involved in violent riotous actions as they stormed the United States Capitol Building,” Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said in a press release today, the first formal statement from this force on what happened yesterday. “These individuals actively attacked United States Capitol Police Officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and took up other weapons against our officers. They were determined to enter the Capitol Building by causing great damage.” Sund also confirmed that multiple pipe bombs found on the Capitol grounds and elsewhere nearby during the incident were indeed real. “The devices were disabled and turned over to the FBI for further investigation and analysis,” he said in his statement. Acting D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee separately told reporters that a vehicle containing additional improvised explosive devices had also been located and secured. More details about what transpired yesterday, and its aftermath, continue to emerge. However, it already seems clear that there was a very real chance of more serious violence. If things had gotten even more out of hand, the value of the identifying striped tape on the plainclothes officers’ Glocks might have been much more apparent.

The War Zone staff,"Updated on Jan 7, 2021",U.S. Capitol Under Siege (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Unprecedented chaos has erupted at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. after supporters of President Donald Trump breached security barricades and made their way inside the building. The situation is evolving very quickly, but there are already reports of at least one person having been shot and the use of tear gas as Capitol Police and security personnel try to regain control of the scene. Members of Congress were in the midst of a debate surrounding the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election when the security breach occurred, prompting the Capitol to go into lock down. Trump has repeatedly asserted the results of the election were fraudulent, including at a rally just today in front of the White House, despite no hard evidence having been provided to support these claims. Police with guns drawn watch as protesters try to break into the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington., AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite So far, there have been no deployments of the National Guard or active U.S. military units in response to the security breach [See update below]. Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, who is third in the chain of command of the District of Columbia National Guard, under the President and then the Secretary of Defense, is said to be in close contact with local and federal law enforcement officials about a possible deployment. The D.C. National Guard had already put hundreds of personnel on alert earlier in the week. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has also already announced a curfew that will begin at 6:00 PM EST. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 4:25 PM EST The images coming out of the U.S. Capitol are truly striking, with protesters making their way onto the floors of Congress and into individual members’ offices. Law enforcement personnel have already detained some individuals. In another truly unprecedented twist for most Americans, the leadership of foreign countries and international organizations are beginning to make public calls for calm in Washington, D.C. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued one such appeal. Another came from the Turkish government, which is certainly no stranger to political upheaval or autocratic leadership . All told, this appears to be one of, if not the most significant breach of the Capitol since British troops stormed the building and set it ablaze on August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812. A reported pipe bomb had already triggered an evacuation of a nearby building earlier in the day, but authorities had already sounded an all-clear regarding that incident before the violence erupted at the Capitol. UPDATE: 4:30 PM EST President Donald Trump has now issued a video statement calling for his supporters to “go home,” but also continuing to insist that the election last November was “stolen” from him, despite there continuing to be no evidence of that being the case. UPDATE: 4:40 PM EST The Pentagon has now activated all members of the DC National Guard to help respond to the situation at the Capitol after talks with Mayor Bowser, in which she reportedly agreed to allow them to engage with civilians, which had been a point of contention. They will, however, not be armed. UPDATE: 4:45 PM EST Pictures have also emerged of a gallows that erected near the Capitol earlier in the day. There is also video that shows Capitol Police officers opening a barricade to protesters before they stormed the building. UPDATE: 4:50 PM EST In addition to the Capitol Police and the deploying National Guard, reports also indicate that law enforcement offers from the D.C. Metro Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S. Park Police have all also taking part in the response. You can read more about more specialized law enforcement capabilities, including tactical teams, better known as SWAT teams, that those agencies have to offer in this past War Zone piece . UPDATE: 5:10 PM EST Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller has issued the following statement regarding the activation of the D.C. National Guard: “Chairman Milley and I just spoke separately with the Vice President and with Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, Senator Schumer and Representative Hoyer about the situation at the U.S. Capitol. We have fully activated the D.C. National Guard to assist federal and local law enforcement as they work to peacefully address the situation. We are prepared to provide additional support as necessary and appropriate as requested by local authorities. Our people are sworn to defend the constitution and our democratic form of government and they will act accordingly.” UPDATE: 5:20 PM EST The aviation picture has been interesting over Capitol Hill. Just one helicopter doing circuits over the Capitol is squawking, an AS 350 that belongs to the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police: ADSBexchange.com Just minutes ago, an E-4B national airborne command post aircraft sortied out of nearby Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. These aircraft are essential tools when it comes to continuity of government and in assuring the resiliency of the nuclear deterrent. We do not know if the E-4B’s mission is related to what is ongoing in nearby Washington, D.C., but they are supposed to launch under certain circumstances from their forward operating location at Andrews. They famously did so during the events of 9/11, for instance. Regardless, the question of continuity of government is a very real one at this time, with personnel scattered about during this crisis. It isn’t clear if any level of these plans have been enacted, but we do know key players have been moved to undisclosed and hardened locations. UPDATE: 5:40 PM EST Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, has Tweeted that the Electoral College Ballots that were to be counted, certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win, were rescued from the floor of the Senate after protested breached the Capitol. He suggested that they could have been burned. Pictures and video also show protests trashing equipment belong to The Associated Press outside of the Capitol. UPDATE: 6:05 PM EST Washington is now under curfew while thousands of people still remain in a face off of sorts with law enforcement. At the same time, the House Sergeant at Arms has declared the Capitol cleared of intruders. On another note, an E-6B TACAMO ‘doomsday plane’ has been orbiting over the region. It isn’t clear if this mission is related to the events in Washington. E-6s do regularly fly missions around the country from various forward staging points. In this case, though, the E-6 sortied out of MCAS Beaufort and flew to the central east coast region and has been flying in the area since. This area includes a track over Chesapeake Bay, Philadelphia, and Delaware. ADSBexchange.com UPDATE: 6:18 PM EST Congressional leaders were indeed evacuated, apparently to Fort McNair, a known Continuity of Government support site. The fog of war is thick surrounding the violence in the Capitol. The woman who was shot was reported deceased by CNN . Apparently, it remains unclear who pulled the trigger. Meanwhile, across the country in the Pacific Northwest, pro-Trump protestors have broken onto the grounds of the Governor’s Mansion in Olympia, Washington. President Trump has also tweeted the following sentiment that is getting a tremendous amount of criticism considering the situation unfolding: Twitter Mitt Romney has called the events an insurrection caused by the President: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, one of Trump’s and MAGA’s biggest official-level supporters, put out the following statement: Trump’s Acting Attorney General also put out a statement condemning the actions by some Trump supporters and warning about law enforcement action: UPDATE: 6:45 PM EST A picture has emerged showing members of Congress wearing hood-type emergency gas masks as they evacuate the Senate floor. The D.C. Metro Police Department had said that protesters had used “chemical irritants” to help them gain access to the building in the first place. Members of Congress, some wearing hood-type gas masks, evacuate the Senate floor after the security breach., AP A picture shows that Capitol Police were also equipped with less-than-lethal launchers capable of firing tear gas rounds, among other ammunition types, but it’s unclear if they ever employed them. The New York Times reported that at least some Capitol Police officers effectively stepped aside rather than confront the protesters after they made their way inside the building. CNN has also reported that suspected pipe bombs were found at the headquarters of both the Democrat and Republican National Committees in Washington, D.C., as well as the Capitol grounds, but were all destroyed in controlled detonations. There is also a picture that shows a protester holding what appear to be flex cuffs, or similar improvised restrains, but, despite suggestions that they might have been planning to take hostages, it’s unclear what the exact intent might have been. UPDATE: 6:55 PM EST Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic Representative from California, have said that the plan is to resume the process of certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win tonight once the Capitol is determined to be fully cleared for use. UPDATE: 8 PM EST— Retired General and Trump Administration Secretary of Defense weighs in with scathing statement: James Mattis The First Lady’s long-time Chief of Staff has resigned: The Electoral College certificates have been moved back to the secured Senate Chamber: Special tactics team inside the Capitol as the session is about to reconvene: Washington, D.C.’s local government has put out more alerts about the curfew that is now hours into effect: Here is the statement from President George W. Bush: George W. Bush UPDATE: 8:07 PM EST— Vice President Pence is now talking in the Senate Chamber. Here is the security the members had as they entered the Capitol: Update: 11 PM PST— Reports state that Pence appears to have been calling the shots in terms of the security reactions to the events on The Hill: Even the deployment of the National Guard seems to have been an issue from the very top of the chain of command: All this puts into question the state of play of the chain of command at this time, at least to a certain degree. Multiple reports also state that National Security Advisor O’Brien, among other White House officials, may resign. Statement from sacked Secretary of Defense Esper: D.C. under public emergency for the next 15 days now: There is also a lot of talk about the 25th Amendment being discussed among senior staff at the White House. Until we have a primary, first-hand source come out about this, it is best to treat it as a rumor. The video below, which is graphic, appears to show the woman being shot as she tried to climb through a window in a set of barricaded doors that led to the offices of the top congressional leadership. It is an incredible chaotic scene with police standing right next to the woman when she was fell to the ground: https://youtube.com/watch?v=AZ9oThRuMVs A huge question that will need to be answered is just how this happened. Clearly, this was going to be a huge and very heated crowd. What failed in terms of preparations and protocols that allowed large groups of people to break into the Capitol? You can imagine how things could have turned out far, far worse if some of those folks were armed and had a far darker and well-coordinated plan. You can imagine a Mumbai like episode here with what appeared to be limited defenses against it even during a massive and historic protest. The time it took for the National Guard to show up is also a huge question at this time. The post-mortem on this thing, at least in terms of the security and defensive measures put in place, will be remarkable. This is the Senate Parliamentarian’s office: UPDATE: 4:15 AM EST It’s done. At around 3:45 AM local time, Congress certified the Electoral College’s vote and Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States. It was a destination we were going to end up at one way or another, it’s just remarkably sad the detour that was taken. This video shows the moment when the line of control between law enforcement and Trump supporters fell. It is clear just how overwhelmed law enforcement was. Russia is already at it. Expect the full leveraging of this event by the Kremlin in the coming hours and days: Trump’s statement came shortly after the joint session ended. You can come to your own conclusions on this one!: Images of various tactical teams standing watch in the Capitol tonight: This is a new angle on the deadly shooting that occurred in the Capitol.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 24, 2021",Iran Just Fired Its Sidewinder Missile Clone From A Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video footage shows that Iran has fired its enigmatic Azarakhsh missile , which was originally claimed to be a combination anti-tank and short-range surface-to-air weapon, from an unmanned aerial vehicle during a recent series of drone-based war games. Imagery taken during the maneuvers clearly shows one of the Sidewinder lookalikes being launched from under the belly of a Karrar drone after the latter took off from a truck-mounted launcher. According to a report today from Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency, the Karrar “interceptor drone” operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Air Defense Force used the Azarakhsh to destroy aerial targets during the second day of the exercise. At the time of writing, there does not appear to be any video or pictures showing missiles fired by Karrar drones actually hitting anything. An Azarakhsh missile under a Karrar drone, with another of the drones launching in the background., via Twitter The exact nature of the Azarakhsh missile remains something of a mystery, but The War Zone looked into the background of the story in this previous article . Suffice to say, the weapon appears to be at least a derivative of the U.S.-made AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile, thousands of which were delivered to Iran before the revolution that ousted the Shah in 1979. While the Sidewinder is best-known as an air-to-air weapon, the basic design has also been adapted by the United States for air-to-ground use in the past, while surface-launched derivatives have also been produced for land-based and naval applications. With that in mind, it’s not clear whether the drone-launched Azarakhsh is now intended to defeat aerial threats or whether it can strike targets on the ground, too. When the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, unveiled the Azarakhsh it was described as a weapon for helicopters and ground-based launchers, but there was no suggestion it would be adapted for drones, too. The video below shows the public debut of the Azarakhsh missile in 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=a7iIk3jep4E However, as The War Zone pointed out when the Azarakhsh first appeared, it would make sense for the weapon to retain at least some capability to engage relatively low- or slow-flying aircraft, including helicopters or small drones. Mehr news agency described the target used in the exercise as having “low radar cross-section,” but provided no additional details or supporting imagery. Even if it was, this is probably of little relevance to the Azarakhsh’s reported infrared guidance system. Other combat drones took part in the drills as well, including examples of the Karrar armed with 500-pound Mk 82 unguided bombs. This combination, in contrast to the Azarakhsh-armed Karrar, had been seen during previous maneuvers last September . Revealed in 2010, the Karrar unmanned aerial vehicle is produced by the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company and has a reported maximum range of around 620 miles. It is launched using a rocket booster and is recovered by parachute. Another novelty of the latest exercise appears to be a version of the Karrar unmanned aerial vehicle fitted with an infrared sensor in the nose. While the function of this is not certain, unconfirmed reports suggest that it converts the drone into a “suicide interceptor,” destroying an aerial target much like a heat-seeking missile, although this would only be a practical solution against slow-moving, non-maneuvering targets. On the other hand, a missile-based self-defense capability for a drone, however clumsy, presents a much higher risk to any aircraft that might be intercepting it. By outfitting its Karrar drone as a missile-armed interceptor, Iran seems to be at least indicating a desire to join a select group of countries that are adopting unmanned aerial vehicles with air-to-air capabilities. Russia’s Okhotnik unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) was reportedly flight-tested with air-to-air missiles for the first time late last year, a development you can read more about here . In that instance, however, no weapons were actually launched. In the United States, meanwhile, these types of developments stretch back to at least 2003, including the arming of the now-retired MQ-1 Predators with Stingers to defend themselves against Iraqi fighters during Operation Iraqi Freedom and, more recently, tests of MQ-9 Reapers armed with AIM-9X Sidewinders . The U.S. Air Force is also working toward fielding loyal wingman-type drones that will be able to carry air-to-ground, and potentially air-to-air, weapons. This is in addition to what are almost certainly classified test and developmental UCAV programs, the potential existence and implications of which you can read all about here . Ironically, Iran’s own activity was a spur to the United States reinstating a self-defense capability to its combat drones. In the last decade or so, American drones have been harassed repeatedly by the Iranians while on patrols over the Persian Gulf. At one stage, F-22 stealth fighters were required to send a message to the crews of Iranian jet crews to leave alone unmanned aircraft operating in international airspace in the region. Rear Admiral Seyed Mahmoud Mousavi, the spokesman for the drone training exercise, told the Mehr news agency that the “army of the Islamic Republic of Iran is able to respond to any enemy aggression by using a variety of long-range combat drones and target the enemy positions within a range of 2,000 kilometers,” but it seems obvious that the air-to-air drone and the claimed anti-aircraft suicide drone also based on the Karrar could have asymmetric applications , too. This could make such drones valuable to one or more of Iran’s proxies, potentially adding an entirely new dynamic to attacks like the one that recently targeted the airport in the southern Yemeni city of Aden and which was blamed on Iranian-backed Houthi rebels . Airliners taking off and landing, as well as large military aircraft, are notably vulnerable to attacks already, and a drone-launched air-to-air missile, or “suicide interceptor,” could complicate this still further. Iran’s military has, of course, routinely made grandiose claims about its capabilities, but is clearly able to make significant developments in many areas, including the unmanned front, and Iranian and Iranian-derived drones have been used to notable effect in the Middle East in recent years . While the Karrar drone is a much lower-tier design compared to the more sophisticated Reaper, let alone the Okhotnik and future U.S. loyal wingman designs, testing it in an air-to-air role could still be a major achievement for Iran, where the armed forces are increasingly embracing the potential of unmanned technologies. As such, Iran already has an extensive repertoire of lower-end drones , but these latest developments suggest the country is also looking at novel capabilities that are still within its means.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 11, 2021",First Official Rendering Of China’s H-20 Stealth Bomber Emerges In Glitzy Recruiting Video,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new, slickly-produced recruitment video for China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force, or PLAAF, closes with the first official rendering of any kind of the long-rumored H-20 stealth bomber . What we see shows a distinct resemblance to the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 Spirit and the future B-21 Raider , but we don’t know how much this depiction reflects the details of the actual design. The PLAAF recruiting video first appeared on YouTube on January 5, 2021, and looks to be legitimate. A notice underneath says “CCTV [China Central Television] is funded in whole or in part by the Chinese government.” Titled “Dream of Youth,” it presents a narrative that follows a single individual as they join China’s air force and become a fighter pilot. At its end, the video takes the viewer into a computer-rendered futuristic-looking hangar containing the stealth bomber, which is first seen under a sheet. This is similar to what we saw in another glitzy video that the state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) released in 2018, which also aped a famous Northrop Grumman Superbowl ad that had teased the aircraft that became known as the B-21. In a reflection on the visor of a helmet, we then see the sheet being pulled off, revealing the front end of the aircraft. A screen capture from the new PLAAF recruitment video showing the rendering of the flying-wing type aircraft while it is still under the sheet., YouTube screen capture The rest of the video includes a mixture of real footage and renderings of various Chinese fighter jets, focusing heavily on the stealthy J-20 . There is one computer-generated segment where one of those stealth fighters flies alongside a formation of early Cold War MiG-15s with North Korean People’s Army markings , a nod to the participation of PLAAF pilots in the Korean War, a formative moment in the service’s early history. The obvious star of the video is this rendering of the flying-wing type aircraft at the end. Details about the H-20 stealth bomber remain scant, but it has been widely believed to have this type of general planform. The Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC), the division of AVIC focused on the development of larger aircraft, including China’s H-6 family of derivatives of the Soviet Tu-16 Badger bomber and the Y-20 airlifter , is reportedly overseeing the H-20 program. Work on that aircraft is said to trace back to at least the early 2000s and the basic design is reported to have been largely frozen by 2011. There have also been reports that XAC may have slowed work on the H-20 to focus on finishing development and then ramping up production of the Y-20. What is shown of the front end of the aircraft in the PLAAF recruitment video has clear similarities to the shape of both the B-2 and a similar rendering of the B-21. The contours of the aircraft that are seen when it is still covered by the sheet also show a cockpit flanked by two air intakes, which is reminiscent of those two Northrop Grumman designs. Another view of the rendering of the flying-wing type aircraft seen in the PLAAF recruiting video., YouTube capture China has certainly very-closely investigated the B-2 design as part of various projects in the past. Photographs of an apparent Chinese B-2 wind tunnel model have been circulating online, which the War Zone has analyzed in-depth in the past, but these are not thought to be directly related to the H-20 program. As The War Zone ‘s own Tyler Rogoway wrote while discussing that wind tunnel model: Copying the B-2 exactly to create the H-20 seems a bit odd, even for China, as well. Better low observable capabilities, higher altitude performance, and a simplified empennage design could be had by not including its saw-tooth trailing edge. This was added midway through the B-2’s development at great cost to allow the aircraft to penetrate at low altitudes. You can read all about this design change and how the original B-2 planform design will likely mirror that of the B-21 Raider in this past special feature of ours. A photograph of the Chinese wind tunnel model, which is of at least a distinctly B-2-like design, if it is not simply meant to represent that aircraft., Chinese internet Without seeing anything of the rear of the computer-rendered design in the new video, it’s impossible to make any new assessment about the H-20’s possible planform in this regard. Even if we did have a full view, it is again worth noting that what we’re seeing here is only a rendering and is likely not necessarily an accurate representation of the final design. Regardless, the rendering is still notable since this is the first official depiction of the H-20 of any kind. In addition, it follows multiple reports in recent years from Chinese media that a possible public reveal of this bomber might be coming in the near-term, as well as the earlier teasing of its design in the 2018 AVIC video . A side-by-side comparison of the Northrop Grumman ad that aired during the Super Bowl in 2015 and teased what became the B-21 bomber, at top, and a similar teasing of what appeared to be the H-20 in AVIC’s 2018 video., Northrop Grumman/AVIC via China Defense Online In the meantime, the PLAAF, as well as the People’s Liberation Army Navy, have been actively demonstrating greater competence in longer-range bomber operations , including in exercises together with Russian bombers and from outposts in the contested South China Sea, using new derivatives of the H-6. This includes the still relatively young H-6N , which is designed to carry air-launched ballistic missiles , including ones that might be tipped with hypersonic boost-glide vehicles , and other outsized payloads, such as large high-speed drones , under its fuselage. However, the underlying H-6 design is dated and can only be expanded upon so much, inherently limiting its utility as a long-range strategic platform, especially in the nuclear deterrent role. Existing reporting suggests that the H-20 will be able to carry 10 tons of munitions and have a maximum unrefueled range of around 5,000 miles, giving it substantially greater reach than any H-6 variant, especially if also armed with long-range land-attack cruise missiles. The H-20 could also provide a valuable long-range conventional weapons truck of sorts for the PLAAF that has the ability to penetrate deeper into hostile territory to strike critical targets, such as command and control and air defense nodes, as well as airfields and other important infrastructure. This could all help pave the way for follow-on strikes by non-stealthy aircraft, as well. This kind of capability would present significant new challenges for China’s opponents, including major potential adversaries, such as the United States and India , across the Asia-Pacific region. Modernized H-6s toting very-long-range standoff weapons and a possible future stealthy medium bomber, the latter of which you can read more about in this past War Zone piece , could also complement the H-20s to provide a very capable and flexible array of extended-range aerial strike options. The H-20 could also springboard a new robust leg of the Chinese nuclear deterrent, putting even the U.S. at risk. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fj1wCjIitIU Introducing a stealth bomber would also be well in line with the PLA’s wide array of other high-tech modernization efforts, including stealthy UCAVs , increasingly more capable drone swarms , hypersonic and anti-satellite weapons , electromagnetic railguns , and more . No matter what, while we have no way of knowing if this video indicates that the actual H-20 — whatever it might be look like in the end — is getting close to breaking cover, it is yet another hint that work on that aircraft is making significant progress.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 22, 2021",Ominous Iran-Related Threat To Fly Plane Into Capitol Broadcast To Air Traffic Controllers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report by CBS News states that Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers in New York heard a clear threat apparently directed at them via a radio frequency yesterday. A digitized voice stated the following: “We are flying a plane into the Capitol on Wednesday. Soleimani will be avenged.” This is a clear reference to General Qassem Soleimani, the former head of Iran’s Quds Force, the external operations branch of the country’s Islamic Guard Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who was killed by the U.S. military near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq a year ago. The anniversary of Soleimani’s death, along with a litany of other issues , is driving extreme tensions between Iran and the United States at this time. The situation has prompted the United States to carry out major military posture changes in the region. JFK air traffic control tower., AP CBS News states that U.S. officials don’t believe what the air traffic controllers heard was a credible threat, although it is a major breach of radio transmission protocol and they are investigating it as such. This is curious as it would seem a bit too hasty to throw it out altogether, especially considering the maelstrom of security issues that are already presenting themselves on what is set to be a nearly unprecedented day that will be marked by protest and disruption on Capitol Hill as the 2020 presidential election is set to be finalized by the legislative branch. CBS News continues, stating: Sources told CBS News a message was sent to air traffic controllers on Tuesday reminding them that any threat or a plane deviating from its flight path should be reported immediately. The FBI is not commenting but said it takes “all threats of violence to public safety seriously.” The Federal Aviation Administration said it is in contact with law enforcement. There is also the nature of Iran’s recent threats towards the United States to consider here, one of which was especially ominous. “It’s even possible that there are people inside your home [the United States] that will respond to your crime,” Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, the current head of the Quds Force, who assumed the position after Soleimani died, said at an event in Iran on News Year’s Day. The reality is that the National Capital Region is the most well-defended ring of airspace in the country. Few outlets, if any, have reported as extensively on it over the years as The War Zone . This post offers a good recent primer on it and how it works. It is defended by a wing of specially-trained pilots that fly F-16C/D Viper fighter jets that are now sporting the most advanced radars the type can carry. These jets sit alert and fly regular air patrols out of Andrews Air Force Base. They are also augmented by outside fighter assets at various times depending on the threat profile and other events happening in the region. MH-65 Dolphin helicopters from the Coast Guard also stand alert at Reagan International Airport, with their job being intercepting ‘slow movers,’ such as light aircraft, and ushering them away from sensitive areas, as well as collecting intelligence on small targets, such as drones. In addition, the National Capital Region is defended by the most advanced integrated air defense system in the United States, which fuzes together a vast array of sensor data, both military and civilian, into a common airspace picture. This allows for split-second decision-making based on the best available information, and rightfully so as those in command may only have seconds to make life and death calls. This same air defense network is tied into NASAMS radar-guided surface-to-air missile systems, which are scattered around the area in an overlapping manner. These missile systems, which use the AIM-120 AMRAAM as their kinetic component, can take down large aircraft within a matter of seconds. There are also close-in point defense capabilities provided by AN/TWQ-1 Avenger air defense systems, which use the latest FIM-92 Stinger missile as their primary kinetic component. These are scattered near sensitive targets in their mobile, Humvee-mounted form, and also i nstalled on hard stands on rooftops near the National Mall. There are many other non-kinetic systems, as well, including high-power laser warning systems and, in recent years, systems capable of locating and disabling small radar cross-section remotely controlled aircraft like hobby drones. So, it’s not as if the National Capital Region is defenseless against an aerial attack, far from it. The ashes of 9/11 changed the way these threats are handled locally in a dramatic fashion. Still, as we have stressed repeatedly for years, the next 9/11 will not happen via a hijacked airliner full of innocent people. It will happen via a swarm of drones and/or lower-end cruise missiles launched from over-the-horizon . There is still much to be done in terms of quantifying and defending against such a threat. With all this in mind, and on a day when Iran specifically showed off its drone and cruise missile swarming capabilities and capacity in a grand and audacious manner, and considering they have been remarkably successful at breaching the best air defense systems available in the past with these capabilities, such a threat needs to be taken seriously. If anything else, this warning, regardless of its intent, should be a stark reminder that we must prepare to counter future threats from above, not just the ones that haunt us from the past.

Please also let us know you think of this new arrangement in the comments below! -Tyler Rogoway Editor Of The War Zone _________________________ “Oxcart” was an odd nickname for the plane that killed pilot Walter Ray. Oxcarts are slow, cumbersome, and old. Ray’s A-12 jet, meanwhile, was fast, almost invisible, and novel. Among the US’s first attempts at stealth aircraft, it could travel as quickly as a rifle bullet, and fly at altitudes around 90,000 feet. On a radar screen, it appeared as barely a blip—all the better to spy on Soviets with—and had only one seat. On January 5, 1967, that single space belonged to Ray, a quiet, clean-cut 33-year old who spent his workdays inside Area 51, then the CIA’s advanced-aviation research facility. Set atop the dried-up bed of Groom Lake in the Nevada desert, the now-infamous spot made for good runways, and was remote enough to keep prying eyes off covert Cold War projects. On the books, Ray was a civilian pilot for Lockheed Martin. In reality, and in secret, he reported to the CIA. A-12 Oxcarts all lined up at Groom Lake. , USAF Ray’s last morning on Earth was chilled and windy, with clouds moving in and preparing to drop snow on the nearby mountains. He took off for his four-hour flight to Florida and back a minute ahead of schedule at 11:59 a.m., the sleek curves of the Oxcart’s titanium body triggering sonic shock waves ( booms ) as it sliced through the atmosphere. He’d done this many times, having already logged 358 hours in these crafts. At 3:22 p.m., Ray radioed back to base: His gas was low. “I don’t know where my fuel’s gone to,” he said. He lowered the plane out of the speedy headwinds, hoping to save some fuel. But the altitude change couldn’t cut his consumption enough. Thirty-eight minutes later, Ray radioed in more bad news. The fuel tank’s low-pressure lights had blinked on. The A-12′s jet engines—so powerful that the director of central intelligence once said they sounded as if “ the Devil himself were blasting his way straight from Hell ”—began to fail, then sputtered out. At 4:02, Ray sent his final known transmission: He was going to eject. Home Plate—as this group of airmen referred to Area 51—began to search. They hoped to hear a transmission from the shortwave radio in his survival kit. For them, this hunt was also personal. Many worked on the same mission as Ray: developing planes that didn’t exist in a place that didn’t exist, sometimes risking an accident like this, which also wouldn’t exist. Isolated in the desert, the group of about 30 staffers Barnes worked with on the site’s Special Projects felt like family. “We went up on Monday morning, came home Friday night,” recalls former Area 51 crewmember T.D. Barnes. “We couldn’t tell our wives where we were at or what we were doing.” At 3:25 p.m. the next day, a helicopter found the plane, strewn across three canyons. The crews cut a road through the sand to schlep out the debris before anyone else found it—and found out about the secret flight. Two days after takeoff, a CIA aircraft finally spotted Ray’s parachute, and men helicoptered in to locate their comrade. His chute formed a shroud around his body, and his ejection seat sat some 50 yards above him on the hillside. The two hadn’t separated, his parachute hadn’t deployed, and so he had slammed straight into the Earth. Blood spattered the ground, but Ray’s boots still had their spurs. To explain the aerial search going on, the Air Force told the public a cover story: An SR-71 Blackbird—whose existence had recently been revealed –flying out of Edwards Air Force Base, had gone down. For years, Ray’s crash sites remained largely hidden from the public. But in the late 1990s, an explorer named Jeremy Krans began what would become a decades-long quest to uncover it all, and ultimately to make Ray’s once-classified life public. “I felt that we needed to do something,” he says, “because nobody knows who the hell Walt is.” Krans had a pastime that gave him the skills to do something about it: urban exploring, sometimes called “urbex” by the initiated. It’s the art of adventuring in and around abandoned or hidden structures, urban and otherwise. Urbexers scavenger-hunt for sites and then crawl through closed tunnels, scour old buildings, flashlight around finished mines, and trek through old military bases. The community—small and loose but dedicated, lurking and sharing on forums and blogs—is populated by photographers and amateur historians. They like to go places that used to be something else, to someone else. They’ve uncovered spots others likely never knew about, like the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane and the rainwater drains under Sydney . Krans, once a frequent poster on the urbex forum UER.ca , has always favored defense sites, beginning with empty missile silos and ghostly military installations in his early 20s. In 1995, he and a group of like-minded friends formed an exploratory crew dubbed “Strategic Beer Command” (a riff on the US’s then-recently disbanded Strategic Air Command ). It would be a few years before they’d learn of Ray’s site, but the motivation was already there: a desire to remember what the rest of the world had forgotten.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Sep 15, 2020",Greece Joins Forces With Israel To Revamp Its Fighter Pilot Training Program,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pilots of Greece’s Hellenic Air Force, who in the near future could be flying both F-35 and Rafale multirole fighters, are set to be trained at a new flight academy, equipped with a complement of 10 new M-346 advanced jet trainers, which Israeli company Elbit Systems has now been hired to establish and operate. Worth approximately $1.68 billion, this is the biggest defense deal between the two countries and also includes upgrades for Greece’s T-6 Texan II turboprop trainer aircraft, as well as other items and services intended to completely overhaul the country’s flight training capabilities. So far, it’s not been announced if the M-346s will be bought outright by Greece or if they will be provided by Elbit on a contractor-owned, contractor-operated basis. The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced today that Elbit had won the Hellenic Air Force training contract, following an international tender that saw competition from Canada’s CAE , also offering a package based on the M-346. The plan has been approved by the government in Athens, but still needs to be formally signed off on by the Greek and Israeli defense ministries. An Israeli Air Force M-346, the same type that will be operated by the new flight academy in Greece., Amit Agronov/Israeli Air Force As well as the flight academy itself, and the ten M-346 aircraft that are produced by Italian company Leonardo, the deal covers maintenance and upgrade of the Hellenic Air Force’s existing T-6 turboprop trainers, as well as the provision of simulators, training aids, and logistic support, all for a period of 20 years. Both the M-346s and the modernized T-6s will be equipped with Elbit avionics. “This agreement reflects the excellent and developing relations we have with Greece. It is a long-term partnership that will serve the interests of both countries,” said Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz. The Hellenic Air Force flight school will be located at Kalamata on the Peloponnese peninsula, which is already home to basic and advanced training courses. It’s expected that the curriculum of this new flight academy will be based on the Israeli Air Force’s model, which is based at Hatzerim and also employs both the M-346 and T-6. The M-346, ten of which will equip the flight academy, is a popular advanced jet trainer that is already in service with Italy, Poland, and Singapore, as well as Israel, which bought 30 examples that are known locally as the Lavi – not to be confused with the abortive Israel Aircraft Industries Lavi fighter jet. A version of the M-346 also unsuccessful vied for the U.S. Air Force’s T-X requirement , initially being offered by Raytheon and Leonardo, and subsequently by the Italian firm alone. T-X competition was eventually won by the Boeing-Saab offering, now known as the T-7 Red Hawk . Greece badly needs new jet trainers to replace its veteran fleet of T-2 Buckeye aircraft. The Hellenic Air Force was one of just two export customers for the T-2, which was designed for the U.S. Navy as a carrier-capable trainer and first flew in 1958. The U.S. Navy retired the very last of its Buckeyes in 2015, with T-45 Goshawks taking their place. Hellenic Air Force T-2E Buckeye., Hellenic Air Force The Cold War-era T-2 is clearly no longer suitable for training pilots destined for the advanced cockpits of upgraded Hellenic Air Force F-16 fighter jets, for example, let alone future frontline aircraft, such as the Rafale or the F-35. In the past few months, and against a backdrop of heightened tensions with neighboring Turkey, Greece has announced plans to buy 18 Rafales from France and has reportedly formally requested information from the Pentagon with an eye to purchasing between 18 and 24 of the stealth Joint Strike Fighters, which you can read more about here . The Greek T-6 fleet, which is planned for modernization under the deal for the flight academy, had fully replaced the iconic jet-powered T-37 Tweet in the initial and basic training roles by 2002. Greece acquired 45 Texan IIs in total, including 20 examples with provision for carrying rocket pods, gun pods, and bombs for weapons training. Hellenic Air Force T-6A Texan II., Hellenic Air Force This new deal provides the opportunity to increase military cooperation between Greece and Israel. In terms of pilot training, this collaboration has already included Israeli Air Force participation in the Hellenic Air Force’s Iniohos exercise, organized by its Air Tactics Center, while Greek jets have also flown in Israel’s corresponding Blue Flag maneuvers. While in Greece, the Israeli Air Force has notably flown training missions against Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems originally procured for the defense of Cyprus, in what has been considered preparation for potential missions against Iran or Syria. Meanwhile, Greece is also expecting to receive three maritime-configured Heron drones leased from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which will provide a much-needed capability boost. Israel is also just one regional military power with which Greece is establishing closer military ties, amid rival claims to energy reserves in the eastern Mediterranean . Ahead of the announced Rafale purchase, the Hellenic Air Force trained with its French counterpart in Crete, for example. Greece also hosted a detachment of F-16E/F Desert Falcons from the United Arab Emirates for joint training last August. A month prior, Hellenic Air Force F-16s were training alongside the F/A-18 Super Hornets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower , southeast of Crete, as part of bilateral military cooperation between the two countries. There is potentially scope for the Hellenic Air Force flight academy to teach pilots from other countries, too. The availability of a full-spectrum training center at a single location could be attractive for air forces that are unable to meet their own training needs, either due to lack of capacity or facilities. The Cypriot Air Force , for example, which lacks a dedicated training fleet, sends its aviators to train in Greece, including on the T-6 and T-2. A mixed formation of T-6, T-2, and M-346., Hellenic Air Force Offering training services to international clients is an increasingly popular solution, as evidenced by the success of the NATO Flying Training in Canada program launched in 2000, which has taught pilots from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, with CAE serving as the prime contractor. Also in Canada, ITPS is a commercial provider of tactical aviation training services, poised to offer a fleet of Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 Fighting Eagle light combat aircraft for tactical and adversary training. You can read more about those plans here . In Europe, meanwhile, the Italian Air Force and Leonardo are collaborating on the International Flight Training School (IFTS), for lead-in fighter training with the M-346. Work on the IFTS formally began at its new home of Decimomannu, on the island of Sardinia, last month . With the promise of advanced live and synthetic training aids, plus good weather, the Hellenic Air Force flight academy could also attract pilot cadets from other countries in the future. Despite financial challenges, Athens has remained committed to a large-scale modernization of its armed forces, with the Hellenic Air Force arguably the tip of the spear. With a significant fourth-generation fighter jet force to sustain, and with plans to acquire more advanced Rafales, and perhaps also F-35s, it makes sense that the country’s pilot training pipeline is overhauled, as well.

The destroyer presently forms the core of the country’s Cheonghae military unit, which is made up of rotational forces deployed primarily to support counter-piracy operations in the Middle East and off the coast of the Horn of Africa. This unit also includes a specialized element focused on visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations. The South Korean Navy’s Chungmugong Yi Sun Sin class destroyer Choi Young leaves Hawaii following the 2012 iteration of the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise., USN “The Cheonghae Unit arrived in waters near the Hormuz Strait earlier in the day,” South Korean Defense Ministry spokesperson Boo Seung Chan said during a press briefing. “It is carrying out missions to ensure the safety of our nationals.” The Choi Young , which has a standard displacement of around 4,400 tons and can displace up to 5,520 tons with a full combat load, is a modern multi-purpose warship. Also known as the KDX II class, the first of these ships entered service in 2003. The primary armament on these ships are Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) arrays, with each of the destroyers having a total of 64 cells. These can be loaded with a mixture of U.S.-made Standard Missile 2 Block IIIA surface-to-air missiles or South Korean-designed Hyunmoo-3 land-attack cruise missiles, as well as the Korean Anti-Submarine Rocket (K-ASROC), also known as the Red Shark , an anti-submarine weapon that has a homing torpedo as its warhead. We don’t know what the Choi Young ‘s exact loadout is on this deployment. The ships also have two four-tube Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers and a five-inch main gun, as well as RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launcher and a 30mm Goalkeeper weapon system for close-in defense. The destroyers have hangars and helipads to support up to two Lynx light helicopters , as well. All told, the Choi Young presents a very capable deterrent against any potential attempts by the Iranians to seize any additional South Korean-flagged merchant vessels that pass through the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Approximately 20 percent of all of the world’s oil exports pass through this narrow waterway and South Korea is one of the globe’s top 10 oil importers. An average of six South Korean-flagged ships transit this strait, in one direction or the other, every day, according to South Korean news outlet Yonhap . Of course, it’s important to remember that the South Korean destroyer is only one ship and cannot be everywhere at once, so there remains a potential risk of further seizures. The South Korean government is not part of the U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct , which was formed in 2019 to monitor for and otherwise deter Iranian aggression in the region, including against commercial shipping , but has said it actively coordinates with that entity . In the meantime, South Korea says it is working through diplomatic channels to free the Hankuk Chemi and its crew of 20, which includes a mixture of South Korean, Myanmarese, Indonesian, and Vietnamese nationals. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rDrUn8GCOsk “The issue should be resolved through diplomacy,” a South Korean official said, according to Yonhap . “The [Cheonghae] unit is focused on the safety of our people who use the waterway after the seizure incident.” “We have been trying to figure out what happened through the Iranian Embassy in South Korea and the South Korean Embassy in Iran and continuing to make efforts to address this situation,” South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha also told reporters . Iran claims that the ship and its crew were detained for violating environmental protocols, something Hankuk Chemi , which the vessel’s operator, Taikun Shipping, has denied. Initial reports had identified that operator as DM Shipping, but that company is actually the owner of the tanker. “If it really was marine pollution, as they say, the coast guard was supposed to approach the ship first,” Lee Chun Hee, Management Director at Taikun, told The Washington Post . “But instead, armed soldiers approached the crew and said they needed to be investigated.” Boats belonging to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps converge on the Hankuk Chemi on Jan. 4, 2021., via IRNA Iranian authorities have all but admitted that the actual reason for impounding the ship has to do with a spat between Tehran and Seoul over $7 billion in frozen Iranian assets in South Korea due to sanctions. South Korea had also been a major importer of Iranian oil until May 2020, when it stopped those purchases in the face of U.S. government pressure. “We’ve become used to such allegations,” Iranian government spokesperson Ali Rabiei said in response to a question during a press conference about whether seizing the Hankuk Chemi amounted to hostage-taking. “If there is any hostage-taking, it is Korea’s government that is holding $7 billion, which belongs to us, hostage on baseless grounds.” South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister had already been scheduled to travel to Iran this coming weekend, in part to discuss this matter, and officials in Seoul say that this trip will proceed as planned. The South Korean government is also now preparing to send a “working level” diplomatic team to that country in response to the Hankuk Chemi incident. South Korea, as well as the United States, have otherwise called for the immediate release of the tanker and its crew. This hardly the first time Iran has seized a commercial ship, or been tied to attacks on them, in an attempt to apply pressure on the international stage. In 2019, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) took control of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero in retaliation for U.K. authorities in Gibraltar impounding an Iranian tanker, then known as the Grace 1 . On the same day that Stena Impero was seized, they also briefly detained another British-owned ship, flagged in Liberia, later claiming they had simply boarded it to make various regulations, including environmental protocols, clear to the crew. Iran released the Stena Impero in September of that year, the month after Grace 1 was allowed to leave Gibraltar . https://youtube.com/watch?v=fpEdfkSWsvI A Japanese-owned tanker was also one of two that were victims of attacks linked to Tehran in the Gulf of Oman in June 2019. That incident came as then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Iran to meet with the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC’s seizure of the Hankuk Chemi also comes amid a spike in tensions between Iran, as well as its regional proxies, and the United States, over a host of issues, including Tehran’s recent decision to begin enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, putting it closer to producing weapons-grade nuclear material should it decide to pursue such a development . This follows the assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh , which Iranian authorities blame on Israel , and is in clear violation of a controversial international agreement over the country’s nuclear program. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. government was pulling out of that deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018. Concerns about a potential attack from Iranian forces, or militant groups that Tehran actively supports in the Middle East, especially in Iraq , had been steadily building in the lead up to the first anniversary of the U.S. military drone strike that killed senior IRGC General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, 2020. Iranian officials have issued various threats and calls for revenge, including against U.S. President Donald Trump directly. This reportedly prompted Trump to order the Pentagon to reverse course on plans to bring the supercarrier USS Nimitz home and instead have it sail back to the Middle East. That decision followed weeks of other signaling meant to deter the regime in Tehran, including multiple long-range B-52 bomber sorties to the region, as well as the rare public transit of the Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf in December. There have been no apparent attacks, so far, on U.S. interests in the region that have been specifically linked to the anniversary of Soleimani’s death. However, the ongoing situation regarding Hankuk Chemi , which has now prompted the appearance of a South Korean warship near the already often tense Strait of Hormuz, shows that the region is as volatile as ever and no nation’s shipping is really safe.

Brett Tingley,"Posted on Jan 16, 2021","The White House’s Planetary Protection Strategy Is About Space Invaders, But Not The Kind You Think","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The National Space Council and Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP has released a new version of its “National Strategy For Planetary Protection.” The document is about alien invasions, but not the kind we are most accustomed to from science fiction. It outlines various strategies and policy goals that various stakeholder agencies, including NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, can employ to ensure “the sustainable exploration of space by appropriately protecting other planetary bodies and the Earth from potentially harmful biological contamination from space exploration activities.” A full version of the planetary protection plan , as well as a truncated fact sheet , can be found on the official White House website. The National Strategy For Planetary Protection comes on the heels of several other significant space policies released by President Donald Trump’s Administration, the most significant of which being the creation of the United States Space Force . The world’s superpowers have been jockeying for position in the new space race over the last two decades, and questions and concerns over the militarization of space loom large. Concept art from NASA’s planned Artemis III mission set for 2024, NASA Aside from increasing military presence in space, concerns are also being raised over the commercialization of space as private companies continue to put more and more technologies into orbit and will eventually be sending their own systems to other celestial bodies, like the moon , asteroids, or even the Red Planet . A number of countries are also accelerating their physical exploration of space, both manned and unmanned, including a race to put humans back on the Moon and eventually Mars. With the prospect of a future in which many spacecraft will be launching to and returning from extraterrestrial bodies, the risk of either forward contamination—bringing Earth-based microbes to other worlds—or backward contamination—bringing home possible extraterrestrial biological material—is a chief concern among planetary scientists and homeland security policymakers alike. With that in mind, the White House’s National Space Council drafted and published the National Strategy For Planetary Protection to define the need for dealing with these issues and to outline strategies by which contamination of either kind can be minimized or mitigated. The document does not lay out any specific policies, but continues the work done by NASA and other governmental organizations to “develop a more cohesive national effort that balances scientific discovery, human exploration, and commercial activity in space.” The report gathered input from a wide variety of agencies that make up the Interagency Working Group on Planetary Protection. In 2019, planetary scientist and former NASA associate administrator Alan Stern told reporters that planetary protection has been a NASA priority for decades. “At the time planetary protection was born at the beginning of the Space Age in the 1960s, we knew very little about the planets and their environments and their habitability; their suitability for astrobiology,” Stern said during a call with reporters. Now, Stern said, “we have a much more nuanced and, for that matter, sophisticated view of them.” The issue of planetary protection dates back to the late 1950s with the formation of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences’ Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX), an ad hoc group that made the first recommendations about sterilization of spacecraft in order to prevent possible contamination of other bodies. In 1967, the United Nations passed the Outer Space Treaty , formally known as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. Article IX of that treaty states, in part, that all nations adhering to the treaty “shall pursue studies of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose.” Over 100 nations are now party to the treaty. Just a few years after that treaty was ratified in the United Nations, the Apollo 11 astronauts splashed down on in the Pacific on July 24, 1969. Following their recovery, the three astronauts were quarantined for three weeks in order to prevent any potential contamination. Astronauts Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Neil Armstrong inside the Mobile Quarantine Facility following splashdown., NASA Members of the Interagency Working Group on Planetary Protection that drafted the new National Strategy for Planetary Protection include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Council (NSC), and eight of the cabinet-level departments of the executive branch including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, and Transportation. The working group was formed in July 2020, and the report was released on December 30. The principles and goals of the Planetary Protection Strategy as outlined in the document., White House The document outlines three key objectives for the National Strategy for Planetary Protection: Objective 1: Avoid harmful forward contamination by developing and implementing risk assessment Objective 2: Avoid backward contamination by developing a Restricted Return Program to protect against adverse effects on the Earth environment due to the potential return of extraterrestrial life Objective 3: Incorporate the perspective and needs of the private sector by soliciting feedback and developing guidelines regarding private sector activities with potential planetary protection implications The third objective is becoming increasingly significant as NASA has turned to the private sector for help in launching spacecraft and even retrieving samples from extraterrestrial bodies, such as the moon . Outside the United States, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) recently retrieved samples from the asteroid Ryugu , while China’s Chang’e 5 mission retrieved 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms) of lunar regolith in late 2019. Meanwhile, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is set to deliver samples of the asteroid Bennu back to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. NASA is already planning to send astronauts back to the moon with its Artemis III mission in 2024, a mission that could see the first woman on the moon . These objectives are described further in the section of the document headed “The Purpose of Planetary Protection:” The practice of planetary protection is grounded in the premise that life may exist beyond the Earth’s biosphere. Should life exist elsewhere in the universe, measures to avoid the introduction of external contaminants are necessary in order to protect life on Earth and ensure the validity of any scientific study related to such a discovery. In essence, planetary protection refers to the policies and practices related to two aspects of space exploration. First, planetary protection aims to protect future scientific investigations by limiting the forward biological contamination of other celestial bodies by terrestrial lifeforms. Second, planetary protection aims to protect Earth’s biosphere by preventing the backward biological contamination of Earth by returning spacecraft and their payloads. For missions that may land on the surface of, or be in proximity to, another planetary body that may harbor life, planetary protection practices are implemented to avoid the harmful biological contamination of that planetary body. For example, if traces of bacteria are discovered on a mission to Mars, researchers would need to determine that the organism was not accidentally brought from Earth. Likewise, if the mission profile includes a return journey to Earth, the prevention of harmful biological contamination of Earth becomes a key consideration. Accordingly, the sampling and return to Earth of material from other planetary bodies must utilize appropriate methods of containment so as to avoid unintended interaction with Earth’s existing biology, such as the accidental introduction of an extraterrestrial pathogen. Dr. Scott Pace, Deputy Assistant to the President and Executive Secretary of the National Space Council, issued a statement accompanying the document’s release. “Current and future missions to Mars and other destinations necessitate a strategy to support a safe, sustainable, and predictable Earth and space environment,” Pace said. “By establishing objectives for the implementation of the 2020 National Space Policy’s direction on planetary protection, this strategy continues American leadership in scientific discovery, human exploration, and private sector space activities.” Immediately after the document’s publication, Pace stepped down from the National Space Council in order to return to George Washington University, where he previously served as Director of the Space Policy Institute within the University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. In a statement , Pace said the past four years were “among the most ambitious and productive years for the United States space enterprise” and the work the council has done under his leadership has “set a foundation for continued progress and advancement in the civil, commercial, and national space security sectors.” It remains unclear if the incoming Biden administration plans to continue the National Space Council, which was created by law under the 1989 NASA Authorization Act. President Donald Trump is the first president to fund and staff the Council since President George H.W. Bush. An overview of the National Strategy for Planetary Protection., White House The new National Strategy For Planetary Protection comes on the heels of several other policy documents released by the White House since 2017, including six new Space Policy Directives and a new National Space Policy released in 2020. One of these, Space Policy Directive 4, released February 19, 2019, covered the aforementioned establishment of the United States Space Force . As America’s military and civilian policies increasingly turn towards space , we can expect to see many more policy directives coming from the executive branch. An extension of this reach into space means governmental agencies and other stakeholders must be prepared for any eventual discovery of extraterrestrial life, which will likely be microbial. In this time of a global pandemic, it goes without saying that even tiny terrestrial microbes can cause widespread societal disruption and threaten national security , let alone alien ones. Those matters aside, it’s exciting to see the White House discussing planetary protection and potential contamination by extraterrestrial microbial life. Mitigating potential contamination is far from just an American issue, as other nations continue to catch up with the United States in terms of space exploration. Hopefully, international cooperation along the lines of the Outer Space Treaty can continue to push the issue forward in meaningful ways, keeping potential space invaders of any size from contaminating Earth and possibly harming our ecosystems.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Let’s Talk About This Intriguing Object Seen In The Scoot-And-Hide Hangar At Area 51,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Private pilot Gabriel Zeifman, who has taken aerial shots of Area 51, also known as Groom Lake, the U.S. Air Force’s famous clandestine flight test center in Nevada, as well as other shy installations , in the past and whose flights we were first to report on , grabbed new pictures of the facility on Christmas Day. Zeifman shared his latest batch of images with numerous outlets via a public link, which has drawn new interest in the base. Overall, they are very similar to past images, but they do include a particularly good view of an elongated hangar-like structure, known as scoot-and-hide shelter, which appears to have a strangely shaped object of some kind visible inside. We have received dozens of inquires asking about this object and the shelter that it sits in, so we thought we would address them in a new post. Before we begin, we want to reiterate that Zeifman shoots these pictures from his small Cessna 150 while flying through tightly controlled airspace under the close supervision of air traffic controllers on the ground. You can see more of his photographs and learn more about how these flights are possible in these past War Zone pieces. Gabe Zeifman You can see a video of Gabe’s latest flight out over the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) below: The shelter in question at Area 51, which measures 120-feet wide by 320-feet long, and has been identified in the past as Hangar 19 , is situated along a taxiway that connects the base’s main ramp area with its long-closed and extremely lengthy original runway. The taxiway continues on to the new active runway to the east. A hangar had existed at this location for years, seemingly back to the 1980s, but by around 2005, substantial additions were made to its north and south ends, effectively tripling its covered length. The next year, wall-like structures were added to either side of the expanded facility, the extensions of which are open on their lower sides. This walled configuration would further block the view of what was going on there not only from the main apron and the main runway, but from prying eyes on Tikaboo Peak a couple of dozen miles away. 2002 image of the existing hangar., Google Earth By 2007, an expanded turn-around pad had been added to its southern end. As such, an aircraft could taxi into the shelter, engines running, and then taxi out, turn around, and head back through to the taxiway. 2006 image of the modified facility with its portico extensions, privacy walls, and turnaround pad. , Google Earth The structure is not really just a hangar in the traditional sense. Scoot-and-hide shelters help conceal flying test articles from prying eyes, most notably from satellites above. This also provides a site closer to the runway where personnel can perform last-chance checks and troubleshooting, as well as arming any explosives, while the aircraft remains concealed. For tactical aircraft, these types of checks are traditionally done at end-of-runway hammerhead areas on operational air bases, which are fully exposed—Groom also has those areas. Similarly, when the test aircraft lands, the shelter offers a place to quickly get it out of sight where it can be made safe before returning to its own assigned hangar under its own power or shut down and then towed back to its hangar at a more opportune time. It can also use the facility to be quickly turned around for another sortie. By 2007, an array of four antenna towers, typically associated with unmanned aircraft operations, were constructed along the east side of the shelter, as well, indicating that it may have been used, at least in part, to support drone test programs. There are other similar arrays around Groom Lake. These specific towers are highly visible in Zeifman’s latest pictures of the base, as well. A 2010 image showing the four towers in place. , Google Earth As for what is seen in the latest image showing the inside the open scoot-and-hide shelter, we really cannot say for sure. To our eye, it looks like a very low-slung dagger-shaped object, similar to the low-observable endcaps and some test articles that have been placed atop radar cross-section (RCS) testing poles at RCS test facilities , although this one has a rise towards its rear, which one could speculate may be a cockpit. So, could this object be a similarly shaped stealthy or high-speed test article? It’s possible. If it is, it sits extremely low to the ground. With that in mind, could it have been a vehicle damaged in a mishap and missing its landing gear? That may be a good reason to store it out in the scoot-and-hide shelter until it can be safely moved elsewhere, disposed of, or returned to flight. An image showing what appears to be a wedge-shaped object inside the scoot-and-hide shelter at Groom., Gabe Zeifman The enhanced contrast image makes it clear something is indeed inside there. , Gabe Zeifman We have to underline that this is just outright speculation and it could very well be something else entirely, including a component of a non-flying asset, such as part of a radar dish. The images do not have the resolution to conclude one way or another. So, we just don’t know, although its odd shape is intriguing, which shouldn’t be surprising, as most things that fly out of Groom under a secretive test regime look alien, at least historically speaking . If we are to go down the rabbit hole in regards to the general shape that we think we are seeing here, at least based on the very limited photographic evidence provided, the closest thing we can find with regards to an actual known aircraft is the Martin Marietta X-24B lifting body. You can read all about this late 1960s initiative here . This program initially emerged out of a grander U.S. Air Force-NASA effort focused on exploring the concept of hypersonic lifting body shapes. This research, including the resulting X-24B, would go on to be used to study unpowered aerial vehicle designs capable of re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere from space and then landing on a traditional runway, work that later informed the development of the Space Shuttle . High-speed lifting glide-body shapes that resulted from tremendous research in the late 1950s and 1960s. , USAF/NASA The X-24B flew into the mid-1970s, after which a follow-on initiative to build a hypersonic test aircraft based on lessons learned from the program emerged. Lockheed was working on plans to do just that via the X-24C—a more powerful outgrowth of the X-24B. It would have been markedly larger than its predecessor and was designed to achieve hypersonic speeds (in excess of Mach 5) at high altitudes using a ramjet or scramjet engine. The L-301 design eventually evolved out of that initiative alongside a number of additional derivatives, before the program was called off due to funding limitations—at least that is what the public record says. NASA Lockheed There are unsubstantiated claims that this program actually morphed into a highly classified one, code-named Copper Coast, which flew secretly out of Area 51 during the 1980s. Regardless, certainly, advanced research into hypersonic flight has never fully stopped and there are likely numerous high-speed flight test programs leveraging exotic test vehicles that have occurred at the base over the decades. Fast forward to today and there are a ton of ideas from decades past that have been re-leveraged as part of the flat out race for hypersonic superiority that was kicked off in the last half of the previous decade and is only maturing now. The shapes that NASA and the Air Force came up with in the 1960s still remain relevant today and have likely been leveraged in additional research. Beyond that, hypersonic parasite aircraft have long been rumored to have been a part of research and development programs at Area 51. That capability has also taken on a new emphasis in the current age of peer competition and we speculate such a mothership -type aircraft that could launch a smaller extremely high-speed aircraft or space-access craft could potentially be intended to call the new tall hangar at the southern end of the base home, if indeed that program is still underway. When it comes to high-speed experimental planes that may exist today, we also know the Skunk Works was looking to test an F-22-sized hypersonic demonstrator that leveraged combined-cycle engine technology slated for its SR-72 concept as soon as 2018 . That is if the option to do so, which supposedly would cost less than $1B to realize according to then-CEO of Lockheed Martin Marilyn Hewson, was executed when it was first openly discussed. That aircraft would have to feature an elongated, dagger-like profile, as well. Conceptual rendering of an SR-72., Lockheed Martin Once again, this is all just interesting background and is not in any way conclusive in regards to what the object is that we are seeing in the photos. We also must underscore that it shouldn’t be a surprise that aircraft exist inside most of the covered aircraft facilities available at Groom. In fact, if anything, most indications point to a chronic lack of space for both ongoing projects and those that are already served their purpose. Oftentimes, test articles are only built for very limited amounts of flight time. Once they have served their purpose, they are stored or disposed of , and literally burying old projects in the ground around Area 51 is said to have occurred as a secure way to make up more space at the high-demand facility. The base’s constant expansion, which has seen no less than three massive hangar projects executed in the last decade and a half , along with many smaller projects, is an even more concrete indication of the need for further aircraft storage space for the clandestine flight test facility. The latest hangar expansion, which The War Zone was first to report on, is similar in some regards to the scoot-and-hide shelter, although on a far grander scale. It too had large portico-like extensions put on both sides of an existing hangar facility that dated back decades. This massively increased its concealed square footage allows for unique operational flows that the original hangar facility could not provide. A side view of the scoot-and-hide facility with the massive new portico expansions on the old F-117 hangars seen behind. , Gabe Zeifman It is also possible that the hangar is being used to support a single program, or at least store test articles related to that program, if it isn’t needed for concealing various aircraft during ongoing test operations. Once again, hangar space is thought to be limited at the base, so using at least part of the scoot-and-hide facility for storage or to support a singular program isn’t out of the question. One puzzling part of this story is that the scoot-and-hide shelter does close via a set of overhead doors on each end—not via outward-swinging doors, as some have confused with the wall-like screens on either side of the facility. Why it remains open is unclear, although it could point to it being used operationally when the images were taken or to the possibility that whatever is inside just isn’t that big of a security risk to leave exposed if the doors are no longer operational for whatever reason. That being said, it is very unlikely that the facility was being used for operational flight testing on or just before Christmas Day, as activities on the base usually wind-down in advance of major holidays. Gabe’s presence nearby is also another indication that flight testing activities were more or less nonexistent at the facility when the images were taken. So, as it sits now, this like so many other things Area 51 related remains of a mystery, and we may never find out if an aircraft that matches the odd description of what we are seeing in the photos above ever even existed at all. That is one of the grand features of Area 51 and the opaque veil of secrecy that has been carefully draped around it over the past six decades of its existence.

Thomas Newdick and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 5, 2021",South Korea Sends Its Forces Into The Strait Of Hormuz After Iran Seizes Tanker (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The South Korea’s government says it has dispatched military forces into the strategic Strait of Hormuz after Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, seized a South Korean-flagged tanker ship earlier today. Officials in Seoul are also demanding the immediate release of the vessel, which Iranian authorities say they detained over alleged maritime pollution. The South Korean Foreign Ministry issued the statement regarding the chemical tanker MT Hankuk Chemi on Jan. 4, 2021. The vessel, which Iran says is carrying 7,200 tons of “oil-based chemicals,” had been traveling from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates when the IRGC took control of it at around 10:00 AM local time. Official pictures of the operation show multiple small Iranian boats swarming the commercial ship, which is now anchored near the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas . The entire crew, 20 individuals in total , including 5 Korean nationals, 11 sailors from Myanmar, two Indonesians, and two Vietnamese, has also reportedly been arrested . IRGC boats swarm the South Korean flagged tanker Hankuk Chemi on Jan. 4, 2021., via Tasnim News Agency The IRGC said that it had seized the ship, which has a gross tonnage of 9,797 tons, after receiving a request from the country’s Ports and Maritime Organization, which was acting on a warrant issued by the coastal Hormozgan province’s prosecutor’s office. Hormozgan is situated along the Strait of Hormuz. The incident was further confirmed by the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) body, which monitors maritime security in the region. “As a consequence of this interaction, the vessel made an alteration of course north and proceeded into Iranian territorial waters,” it said in a statement. The Hankuk Chemi ‘s South Korean-based operator, DM Shipping, has denied the ship violated any environmental protocols. It’s unclear what forces South Korea has now sent the area and what actions they may be authorized to take. In January 2020, South Korean officials announced that they would expand their Cheonghae military unit , which has previously been focused on anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden in cooperation with the U.S. Navy-led Combined Task Force 151 , to also cover operations in and around the Strait of Hormuz. South Korean Navy destroyers make rotational deployments in support of the Cheonghae unit, and form the core of that force, but it is unclear which of the country’s warships is in the region now. The South Korean military is not technically part of the U.S.-led International Maritime Security Construct , which was established in 2019 specifically to patrol in and around the Strait of Hormuz and elsewhere in the Middle East and monitor Iranian activities. This is certainly not the first time the Iranians have seized a foreign-flagged tanker in the region. In July 2019, the IRGC notably took control of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero , officially over allegedly breaking maritime rules. On the same day, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards also briefly detailed the Liberian-flagged tanker Mesdar , which is owned by a British company. Iranian officials later claimed they had only stopped that ship to inform the crew of environmental and other maritime regulations. https://youtube.com/watch?v=fpEdfkSWsvI The seizure of the Stena Impero was seen as direct retaliation for British authorities in Gibraltar detaining an Iranian tanker , then named Grace 1 , earlier in that year. The U.K. government released Grace 1 in August 2019 and Iran let Stena Impero go the following month. This latest incident comes as Iran and South Korea are currently at loggerheads over the status of Iranian funds worth $7 billion that are frozen in South Korean banks due to sanctions imposed by the United States. South Korea’s deputy foreign minister was reportedly planning to visit Tehran soon to discuss Iranian demand for the release of the funds. It’s also worth noting that South Korea, one of the world’s top 10 oil importers, had been a major customer of Iran’s before agreeing to halt those purchases in May 2020 under pressure from the U.S. government. The IRGC detaining the Hankuk Chemi could offer a way to put pressure on both countries simultaneously, or even seek to drive something of a wedge between them, especially over the issue of sanctions. The incident comes amid a surge in geopolitical friction between Iran and the United States. On Jan. 3, the Pentagon announced that the supercarrier USS Nimitz would return to Middle Eastern waters in response to threats from Iranian officials, including some directed specifically at President Donald Turmp, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the U.S. military’s killing of IRGC General Qassem Soleimani . An American drone strike killed Soleimani, then-head of the Quds Force, the IRGC’s external operations arm, in Baghdad, Iraq, in 2020. Trump himself reportedly directed Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller to order the carrier back to the Middle East. Just days earlier, Miller had announced that the Nimitz , which had been sailing in the Indian Ocean in support of the withdrawal of American troops from Somalia , would be heading home after a particularly lengthy deployment. That move was also said to be aimed to be a de-escalatory move after weeks of signaling to the regime in Tehran in the form of multiple long-range B-52 bomber sorties and the extremely rare public transit of the Ohio class guided-missile submarine USS Georgia through the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. intelligence community has reportedly seen a recent increase in the alert posture among Iranian military units, including air defense and maritime elements. However, it is unclear whether or not this in preparation to respond to any American retaliation to an attack from Iran or its regional proxies or if this is a reaction to threats from the U.S. government, real or otherwise. Iranian-backed militant groups throughout the Middle East have issued their own calls for justice and revenge while commemorating the anniversary of Soleimani’s death. In Iraq, in particular, militias that Tehran supports have stepped up rocket and other attacks aimed at U.S. interests in that country in recent weeks. There is also the matter of Iran resuming enriching uranium at up to 20% purity, reducing the time it would take for the regime in Tehran to produce weapons-grade level material for use in a weapon, should it choose to do so. The enrichment work is being carried out at Fordo, in a site buried within a mountain , which provides significant protection from aerial attack . This is in clear violation of the controversial international deal that Iran made with the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, in 2015. In May 2018, Trump announced that the U.S government would pull out of that agreement and the U.S. government subsequently reimposed sanctions against Tehran. Iran informed the United Nations about the uranium enrichment last week, after a parliamentary decision in response to the killing of top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh . The details of this assassination, which Iran has blamed on Israel and claimed involved a gun in either a remote-controlled or entirely automated mount on a pickup truck, is something The War Zone has discussed in detail in the past . Iran actions with regards to its nuclear program, as well as other activities, such as the seizure of the Hankuk Chemi , could be part of an effort to prepare the ground for the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has indicated that it would be willing to rejoin the nuclear deal. The Biden offering has been billed as a “compliance for compliance” deal, which would see economic sanctions on Tehran lifted if the country accepted the restrictions outlined in the original deal, including uranium enrichment. No matter what the IRGC’s exact reasons for seizing the Hankuk Chemi may have been, and how it might be intertwined with the large geopolitical picture, this incident, as well as South Korea’s immediate response to move military forces into the area, underscores just how complex and potentially dangerous the situation in the region is at present. UPDATE: 6:15 PM EST The U.S. State Department, in a statement to South Korean news outlet Yonhap , has now also called for the immediate release of the Hankuk Chemi . “The United States is tracking reports that the Iranian regime has detained a Republic of Korea-flagged tanker,” a State Department spokesperson said, using South Korea’s official name. “The regime continues to threaten navigational rights and freedoms in the Persian Gulf as part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions. We join the Republic of Korea’s call for Iran to immediately release the tanker.” U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT) also told ABC News that it was monitoring the situation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 7, 2021",The B-2 Bomber Looks Positively Alien In These Images,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Northrop B-2 Spirit looks just as futuristic as it did when it was unveiled over three decades ago. It is such an exotic and capable aircraft that you almost feel like you are seeing something forbidden when in its presence. With this in mind, I have done articles in the past solely on the aircraft’s otherwordly appearance and how it is captured in captivating ways via unique images. Yet the images below truly convey the stealthy flying-wing bomber’s alien feel, conjuring up fond memories of the 1980s sci-fi flick Flight Of The Navigator —a movie that was also about a secretive exotic craft, albeit one actually from another world. The photo below, taken by Major Allen Clark is possibly my favorite B-2 shot of all time. It brilliantly captures the not so linear slopes that make up the Spirit’s leading edge, all of which come to an apex in, well, one wicked-looking beak. Major Allen Clark Although it is only really apparent from a limited number of angles, and the B-2 is a shapeshifter of epic proportions depending on what aspect you are looking at it from, the aircraft’s beak is possibly the most exquisite of all its almost organic-like attributes. This shape is extremely reminiscent of the alien ship in Flight Of The Navigator. The movie hit theaters in 1986, right when the B-2 was deep in classified development under the Next Generation Bomber program. Just two years later it would be unveiled to the public. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7pNhdeFPl60 The dramatic head-on, wide-angle image below is of a B-2 getting its coatings repaired. The aircraft’s radar-absorbent material (RAM) skin coverings and the radar attenuating understructures underneath must be kept in pristine shape in order to maximize the aircraft’s scant radar cross-section on which its survivability depends. This adds greatly to the massive cost of operating the type, which is pegged at roughly $122,000 per flight hou r, although automation and new materials have made the process more efficient. B-2’s coatings getting some TLC.  , USAF You can see in the detailed image below what I mean when I reference the aircraft’s exotic skin coatings, the exact composition of which remain one of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets. This arguably beautiful underside ‘beak’ shot of the B-2 shows the intricate sections of RAM that are taped and puttied onto the aircraft, as well as its severe leading edge. The round flush objects are part of the aircraft’s Flush Air Data Sensing (FADS) sensors that work in a similar manner to pitot tubes and standard air data sensors on normal aircraft. They feed critical information to the B-2’s flight computers to keep the jet pointed in the right direction. Without this information, the aircraft becomes inherently unstable. Water intrusion into these sensors caused the dramatic crash of a B-2 in Guam in 2008, which ended in the only write-off of a Spirit airframe. USAF One must remember that even though the B-2 looks incredibly futuristic, it was designed based on early 1980s technology , albeit technology that was absolutely on the ‘bleeding edge’ of the possible at the time. With just 20 in existence, the B-2 fleet is more akin to a pocket force of experimental aircraft than not. That is what is so exciting about the upcoming B-21 Raider , it really is Northrop Grumman’s shot at building a “B-2.0,” with 30 years of advances and the experience of building and supporting the first of its kind stealth bomber all rolled into what should be a far more numerous, capable, flexible, sustainable, and even less costly aircraft to fly. The dramatic photo below, a quintessential shot seen in many science fiction and action movies (Jerry Bruckheimer, I am looking at you!), shows a column of light shooting through an opening in the hangar doors, illuminating the object inside with an almost ‘sacred’ feel. The image also gives us a wider angle of the B-2’s corner-like nose section, with its huge electronically scanned radar array seen outlined on its lower half, as well as all the other taped-off maintenance access covers and sensor apertures. Note the jet’s serrated gear-door and weapons-bay door edges even get their own covers. You do not want to trip into those! USAF The next photo is close to an external view of the one above. Such an exotic looking machine with its continuous curvatures looks positively alien among the stark right angles of the hangar. Imagine seeing this for the first time before it was rolled out to the public. It would have been like being in the presence of a time machine. The jump from Northrop’s stealthy “whale,” better known as the Tacit Blue BSAX demonstrator , to the B-2 is truly remarkable, although there may very well have been a couple of yet-to-be-disclosed missing links along the way. Still, the time between Tacit Blue’s first flight and the B-2’s first flight was just seven years . That is absolutely mind-boggling. If you had heard of a B-2 before and walked by this hangar, you would likely think you just saw a spaceship. USAF Finally, there is this stunning overhead shot of a B-2 refueling behind a KC-135. I could write an entire post on all the features we are seeing here, but they all serve a purpose and help tell the story of the B-2’s low-observable design goals and how engineers turned them into a real flying weapon of war. You can see all the taped over and serrated composite panels, and the incredible engine inlet design with its own serrated edges and lower boundary layer air separator. The air inlets on low observable aircraft are among the hardest parts to design and manufacture. In fact, we have multiple articles on this exact reality alone . The fiberglass ejection apertures are also visible via their dashed ‘cut here’ outlines, including the third one that was originally intended for an additional crew member, but was never used in this manner. A small cot is placed in its position for one of the aircraft’s two pilots to get some sleep during extreme endurance global power missions. You can also see the celestial navigation unit to the right of the cockpit, as well as one of my other favorite features on the B-2, the subtle but present W-shaped, crease-like, raked vent situated between its nose and windscreen. If this is what Northrop came up with over three decades ago, it will be fascinating to see what the fine details on B-21 end up looking like. USAF So, there you have it. The B-2 Spirit’s alien appearance still amazes after all these years. The design remains among the most elegant engineering solutions of all time, and this becomes especially apparent when one examines its many details. As it sits now, the flying wing aircraft will serve through 2032 , after which the B-21 will have fully taken its place as America’s stealth bomber.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 9, 2021",USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group Ordered Back To Middle East Due To Iran Threat (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just two days after the Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller had ordered the supercarrier, USS Nimitz , to head home as a “de-esclatory” gesture toward Iran, the order has been rescinded and the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group is now set to remain in the Middle East until further notice. The carrier had been operating off the coast of Somalia as part of the ongoing operation dubbed “Octave Quartz” aimed at pulling U.S. troops out of that country and redistributing some of them elsewhere in Northern Africa. The ship has been deployed for an arduous ten months, which has been especially challenging due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic. The return to Bremerton, Washington was seemingly overdue, but that is now put on hold in order to counter potential Iranian hostilities, or even possibly take part in an operation against that country should President Donald Trump give the order to execute one. USS Nimitz underway. , US Navy The statement on Jan. 3, 2021, from Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller regarding keeping Nimitz in the Middle East., DOD The nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine USS Georgia , a vessel packed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and special operations forces, made a very rare high-profile transit into the Persian Gulf on December 21st, seemingly to offset the absence of a carrier group there due to Nimitz’s tasking off the Horn of Africa. Still, it is very unlikely that a carrier strike group would choose to be in the Persian Gulf should a conflict with Iran erupt. The relatively small and nearly land-locked body of water is a super anti-ship missile engagement zone and is rife with other threats that are hard to counter, including the potential small-boat swarm attacks , naval mines , and non-traditional submarine operations . Concerns about the possibility of attacks from Iranian proxies, or even Iran itself, have been steadily growing ahead of the first anniversary of the death of Qassem Soleimani. A U.S. military drone strike killed Soleimani , the then-commander of Iran’s Quds Force, the portion of the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), outside of Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 3, 2020. Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis, then-head of Kata’ib Hezbollah , one of Iraq’s most prominent Iranian-backed militias, also died in the strike. Just last week, there were reports that the U.S. intelligence community had assessed that Iranian military units, including air defense and maritime elements, had gone on high alert. However, it was unclear if those actions had been taken in order to be prepared for possible American retaliation to attacks from Iranian or Iranian-backed forces or in response to U.S. threats, real or imagined. Earlier in December, many senior Iranian officials, including Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the country’s President Hassan Rouhani , the latter of whom typically represents a more moderate voice in Iranian politics, had already threatened revenge over Soleimani’s death. This kind of fiery rhetoric from Iranian officials immediately continued into the new year. “Do not presume that someone, as the president of America, who appeared as a murderer or ordered a murder, may be immune from justice being carried out. Never,” Ebrahim Raisi, Chief Justice of Iran, said on New Year’s Day . “Those who had a role in this assassination and crime will not be safe on Earth.” “It’s even possible that there are people inside your home [the United States] that will respond to your crime,” Esmail Ghaani, who became head of the Quds Force after Soleimani’s death, said at the same event. Pro-Iranian militant groups across the Middle East have also made similar calls for justice and threats over the deaths of Soleimani and Al Muhandis. In Iraq, specifically, a major rally took place today in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square to mark the anniversary and protest the American government. “No, no to America!” shouted some in the largely mask-less crowd. “You killed our guest. There is no place here for your embassy,” some of the banners read according to The Washington Post . In recent weeks, there has also been a notable spike in tensions between Iranian-backed militias and U.S. forces, as well as the Iraqi government. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustapha Al Kadhimi has been facing increasing criticism and threats from those groups over arrests of militants on charges of being responsible for recent rocket attacks aimed at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Some Iranian-backed groups in Iraq have also been claiming attacks on locally-operated supply convoys supporting the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in the country, as well. We have to stress that this abrupt move is not necessarily a prelude to war. Keeping the carrier strike group in the area even for a relatively short period of time accomplishes two things. First it provides a highly visible deterrent signal to Tehran. Second, it gives commanders more assets to leverage should a kinetic operation kick-off, one that is not tied to fixed runways that are all vulnerable to Iran’s numerous ballistic missile forces. We will continue to update this post with more information as it comes available. UPDATE: 1/4/21 CNN has now reported that the decision to send the USS Nimitz back to the Middle East came from President Donald Trump himself. That same report said that officials at U.S. Central Command had also disagreed with Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller’s idea of sending the carrier home to try to de-escalate tensions with Iran. The Pentagon’s announcement of the new plans for Nimitz did ultimately come a day before Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized a South Korean-flagged tanker, which you can read about in this new War Zone piece .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 23, 2020",First Royal Air Force Wedgetail Radar Plane Will Be Converted From An Ex-Chinese Airliner,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The first Boeing E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft for the British Royal Air Force will be a converted 737-700 Boeing Business Jet last operated by a Chinese airline. The revelation was uncovered recently by the aircraft spotters community in the United Kingdom and was first published on the Military Aircraft Markings website . The initial 737 to be converted for the Royal Air Force’s Wedgetail contract currently wears the U.S. aircraft registration number N946BC and has the Boeing construction number 38633 . The most intriguing aspects about this choice of the airframe are its age — it was first flown back in June 2010 — and the fact that it was previously flown by Chinese carrier Deer Jet, a charter operator based in Beijing. It is unclear why Deer Jet, which describes itself as having “the largest fleet of business jets in the Asia-Pacific region,” gave up the airframe, which is currently owned by the manufacturer, Boeing, and stored at San Bernardino International Airport in California. The Boeing 737-700 during its career with Deer Jet in China. , N509FZ/Wikimedia Commons The aircraft is due to arrive in the United Kingdom this month, before being converted to airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) standard by STS Aviation Services at its Birmingham Airport facility. Boeing UK confirmed last November 2 that the first fuselage sections for the initial two Royal Air Force Wedgetail aircraft had been delivered to STS. Once conversion work is complete, the first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to the Royal Air Force as a Wedgetail AEW1 in 2023 and will be operated from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland — this base’s airborne early warning legacy is a subject that The War Zone has looked at in the past . The final aircraft should arrive at the base in 2026. The choice of this ten-year-old, formerly Chinese-operated airframe has raised a few eyebrows. On the other hand, it had long been planned to use secondhand civilian airframes as the basis for the first two Royal Air Force Wedgetails. The remaining three aircraft will be brand-new off the Seattle production line, using slots reserved for 2021 and 2022. Such a move is not without precedent, to reduce costs and/or reduce delivery times. For example, the U.S. Air Force has looked to save money on its fleet of new presidential aircraft by buying abandoned 747-8i airliners Boeing first built for a now-bankrupt Russian airline. You can read all about that controversial program here . In the case of the Royal Air Force’s Wedgetail aircraft, the decision to use secondhand jets for a portion of the fleet was taken in order to expedite service entry. Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Ian Gale tweeted: “We sourced some low-hours aircraft in order to jump-start our program without having to wait for slots on the Boeing skyline. It helps accelerate the initial conversions and therefore introduce the new aircraft as quickly as we can.” Boeing has to date secured four customers for the AEW&C variant of the 737 — Australia, Korea, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Regardless of whether new-build or secondhand, the Wedgetail starts life on the production line in civilian guise before being converted to military standard, including cutting out a large aperture in the upper fuselage to accommodate Northrop Grumman’s Multirole Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) surveillance radar. The 737-700 also serves as the basis for the U.S. Navy’s C-40 Clipper logistics transport, while the P-8 Poseidon maritime multi-mission aircraft, which is also flown by the Royal Air Force , is derived from the 737-800. Both the 700 and 800 belong to the Boeing 737 Next Generation series and not part of the troubled 737 MAX family, which recently resumed flying in the United States after being embroiled in controversy following multiple crashes. The British Ministry of Defence announced the $1.98-billion order for five Wedgetail aircraft in March 2019. These are to replace the Royal Air Force’s current fleet of six E-3D Sentry AEW1s , two of which had already been classed as “long-term unserviceable.” The move was widely expected following the selection of the Wedgetail as the front-runner to replace the Sentry the previous October . At the time of the order, Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: “[The] announcement about the procurement of five E-7 Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft is excellent news for both the RAF and wider defense. This world-class capability, already proven with our Royal Australian Air Force partners, will significantly enhance our ability to deliver decisive airborne command and control and builds on the reputation of our E-3D Sentry Force.” A Royal Air Force E-3D Sentry AEW1., Crown Copyright The aging Sentry entered Royal Air Force service in 1991 and, unlike its counterparts in the United States and elsewhere, the fleet has never received a major upgrade since, as well as becoming increasingly unreliable. The two grounded E-3s were put up for sale recently . With a pressing requirement for new AEW&C aircraft, the Wedgetail looks set to be a much-in-demand asset once it becomes available. Provided its path to Royal Air Force service is trouble-free, the fact that one of the jets previously saw service flying charter flights out of Beijing will perhaps be quickly forgotten.

It was from here that SR-71s would launch and recover for stateside missions. The aircraft would ooze its specialized JP7 jet fuel prior to starting in these hangars, a byproduct of an airframe designed to expand due to friction heat as much as four inches during high-speed flight.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2020",Egypt Takes Diving Through Flaming Hoops To The Next Level By Mounting Them On Trucks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Though of dubious training value, having people jump or dive through flaming hoops is a staple of displays of martial prowess by military forces around the world, as well as in training camps that terrorists and militants operate. Recently, the Egyptian Army posted a video online showing that they have put a new twist on the concept, putting the hoops in motion, rather than on static frames, by bolting them to the sides of jeeps. The video in question appeared on the Egyptian Armed Forces’ official YouTube channel on Dec. 28, 2020. The title says that it shows members of the country’s Second Field Army preparing for operations in the Sinai Peninsula , where a branch of ISIS continues to be active and present a very real threat to Egyptian security forces. No further information is provided about this particular display in the caption. The Egyptian Army’s jeep-mounted flaming hoops., Egyptian Armed Forces capture The mobile flaming hoops, which are mounted, one on each side, to the rear of what appear to be U.S.-made 4×4 Ford M151 Military Utility Tactical Trucks (MUTT), are among the first things highlighted in the video. The jeeps are seen driving around in a race track pattern on the parade ground as lines of troops run in place, leaping through the hoops as they come around. Later in the video, Egyptian soldiers are also seen diving through square frames, which are also on fire and are being pulled toward them on a sled-like arrangement by trainers. All around, other troops are seen making other displays of strength, including moving through various obstacles, flipping over large truck tires, and doing calisthenics. The sled-like flaming frame., Egyptian Armed Forces capture Other parts of the footage show troops conducting various other kinds of training, including working together with M113 armored personnel carriers in areas that appear to represent, relatively simplistically, forward operating bases and urban environments. There are also clips of simulated firearms training, as well as hand-to-hand combat drills. Circus-like stunts could help inure an individual to the kind of dangerous situations they might experience in combat, making them less likely to freeze up when it matters the most. There are multiple kinds of drills that many world militaries employ ostensibly for this purpose . Whether or not jumping through a ring of fire in this kind of very controlled environment really has the intended effect is, at best, debatable. Nevertheless, it does certainly promote a certain esprit de corps among the participants. This often seems to be the bigger point of these types of drills, which focus heavily on individual strength and trust in one’s comrades . Any morale-boosting benefits of a demonstration like this would be a boon for personnel assigned to the 2nd Field Army, which has been among the units engaged in the fight against ISIS in the Sinai in recent years. That campaign has been a bloody slog that shows no signs of ending any time soon. Just this month, the terrorists have reportedly stepped up attacks specifically on civilians by booby-trapping their homes .

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 22, 2020",It’s Official: Pentagon Puts F-35 Full-Rate Production Decision On Hold,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a setback for the Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter program, the U.S. Department of Defense has formally decreed that a decision on full-rate production of the jet is on indefinite hold. The Milestone C decision on whether or not to ramp up the manufacture of Joint Strike Fighters had been due in or before March 2021, but has now been on hold pending completion of the final phase of operational testing of the F-35. Bloomberg was first to report news of the verdict, which was made by Ellen Lord, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment in the Trump administration. There had been previous suggestions that a delay was at least likely, before today’s official confirmation. U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs assigned to VMFA-121 await refueling at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa, Japan, December 17, 2020.  , U.S. Marine Corps/Lance Cpl. Dalton J. Payne While more than 600 F-35s have been manufactured so far by the Joint Strike Fighter enterprise, including 123 examples delivered in 2020, wrapping up the Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) is a formal requirement before the formal launch of full-rate production. Once that happens, it will signal that the Pentagon officially has confidence in the program’s maturity and that the jet is able to perform as required in all operational conditions. Ultimately, the manufacturing run of the F-35 could reach 3,200 aircraft, depending on different nations’ requirements and emerging new customers. The U.S. Air Force alone has a program of record to eventually buy 1,763 conventional takeoff and landing F-35As, 241 of which had been delivered as of last summer. Furthermore, the production-related milestone is supposed to confirm that the F-35 meets maintenance requirements, which have fallen short in the past , and that the manufacturing effort is running efficiently. This year, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic mean that fewer F-35s have been delivered than was originally planned. The latest hiccup in the F-35 program is a result of delays to operational testing in the Joint Simulation Environment . The F-35 needs to prove itself in these trials in order to complete the IOT&E phase and kickstart the full-rate production review. This a critical, roughly month-long testing phase was originally supposed to begin in 2017. That schedule subsequently slipped and there had been a hope that those trials would begin this month. Now, the F-35 is not likely to enter the Joint Simulation Environment until mid-to-late 2021. Jessica Maxwell, Lord’s spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that the latest holdup on operational testing came about due to “technical challenges and the impact of COVID-19.” This indicates that the completion of the Joint Simulation Environment facility at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, is running behind schedule. The site is required to assess the jet’s ability to counter high-end air defense systems, including aircraft and missiles likely to be fielded in the next 10 years. Maxwell said an “independent technical review” is now required before a revised timeline can be announced, with low-rate initial production (LRIP) of F-35s to continue in the meantime. The first LRIP contract for the Joint Strike Fighter, covering just two F-35As, was signed back in 2007. An F-35A is lifted by an overhead crane from the Fort Worth factory’s Electronic Mate and Assembly System, where major components are joined together to form the structure of the jet., Lockheed Martin Pushing out the full-rate production determination means that the Milestone C decision will fall to President-elect Joe Biden’s Administration. Even once operational testing is complete, another two to three months will be needed to analyze all the data gathered and prepare a report for the Pentagon, on which to base the decision. Laura Seal, an F-35 program spokeswoman, told Bloomberg that revised dates for both the Joint Simulation Environment tests and the potential full-rate production decision could be announced by the end of February 2021. The Pentagon delaying the Milestone C decision is the latest complication to afflict the F-35 program, which only completed the previous System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase in 2018 and did so only after the Joint Program Office had deleted a number of test points in order to meet its goals. Despite this, the 10-year-long SDD effort still failed to meet the much-revised schedule.

Dominic Romero All three F-35 variants have in the past been plagued by a litany of deficiencies, including performance limitations, difficulties operating in extreme weather, dangerous cockpit pressure incidents, faults in the helmet-mounted display , serious safety concerns in the event of a blown tire , and more. In January this year, a report from the Office of the Director of Operational Test & Evaluation confirmed that the F-35 still had 873 unresolved deficiencies , with new problems emerging on a regular basis. Admittedly, even under low-rate initial production, the F-35 is being produced in significant numbers and it has now declared initial operational capability with nine nations and has been employed in combat by three of them. The manufacturing schedule for 2020 originally anticipated 140 units, compared to 180 aircraft when Joint Strike Fighter production hits its anticipated peak production rate in 2024. However, the continued failure to complete IOT&E — and in turn trigger a full-rate production decision — means that question marks will continue to hang over the viability of the jet, especially in the kinds of high-end warfare scenarios in which the F-35 is anticipated to fight for decades to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A recent photo of the Harbin Z-20, widely described as a Chinese clone of the H-60/S-70 design, shows the helicopter carrying KD-10 air-to-ground missiles . This suggests that the People’s Liberation Army is planning to use the Z-20 in the attack role, perhaps in support of special operations forces, similar to the employment of armed Black Hawks and Seahawks by the U.S. military and selected foreign operators . Moreover, the addition of a new capability demonstrates the growing importance of the Z-20 to the wider Chinese military, with a range of land-based and maritime derivatives now known to be in existence. The photo was brought to our attention by Andreas Rupprecht , an expert on Chinese military aerospace and friend of The War Zone who tweets as @RupprechtDeino . It originates from the Chinese microblogging website Weibo, though it’s unclear where or when it was taken. The Z-20 in the picture appears to have a loadout of at least eight KD-10s, four on each of a pair of stub wings mounted on the sides of the helicopter. It’s not clear if these are dummy missiles or live rounds. Z-20 helicopters fly during the 5th China Helicopter Exposition at Free Trade Zone of Tianjin Port on October 10, 2019, in Tianjin, China. , VCG/VCG via Getty Images The KD-10 missile was reportedly developed specifically for the Z-10 attack helicopter and is broadly in the same class as the AGM-114 Hellfire . It is thought to use semi-active laser guidance and has a range of around four miles. The War Zone has in the past examined the story of the development of Z-20, itself, noting that it differs from the Black Hawk in a number of small ways, including the profile of the cockpit area, its tail configuration, and above all, its five rotor blades instead of the four found on the H-60/S-70 series. Still, it seems highly unlikely that the similarities between the Chinese and American designs are entirely a coincidence, since Beijing outright acquired 24 S-70C Black Hawks from the United States in the mid-1980s. This was before the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 put an end to any further arms transfers from the United States and the European Union to the government in Beijing. Still, the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF) has also remained an enthusiastic operator of its small fleet of S-70Cs, continuing to fly them in roles including assault, cargo transport, and liaison duties, often in high-altitude environments. Unlike the missile-toting Z-20, however, the Black Hawks have not, so far, been seen with any external armament. However, unable to procure any more S-70s, China has instead relied heavily on Russia to provide Mi-17s , an export version of the Mi-8 Hip medium-lift helicopter family , which fill a similar role as the Black Hawks. The Z-20 is expected to eventually replace the S-70s, as well as at least some of the Mi-17s. While the land-based Z-20 has not previously been seen carrying external armament, a People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) Z-20F, a maritime derivative of the same basic design, has been seen in a similar configuration to this PLAGF Z-20 in the past. The Z-20F can also be fitted with auxiliary wing-like hardpoints that should allow it to carry a range of weapons for littoral warfare, much like the U.S. Navy’s MH-60R and MH-60S Seahawks , or for fire support during amphibious operations. A Z-20F seen with pylons and missiles during testing. , via Chinese internet It’s worth noting that the stub wings seen on this armed PLAGF Z-20 appear to be painted a shade of light gray, reminiscent of the paint scheme found on the PLAN Z-20Fs, rather than the black paint job found on the Chinese Army variants. However, the hardpoints previously seen attached to the Z-20F appear to be smaller than those seen on this missile-armed Z-20. The helicopter is also fitted with an air data boom, so it is being used for testing. As such, seeing it with new capabilities like this makes sense. Both types of hardpoints are broadly similar to various types of stub wings , including the External Stores Support System (ESSS) and Lightweight Armament Support Structure (LASS), found on their American-made counterparts. Visually, the missile-toting Z-20 looks very much akin to the Direction Action Penetrator (DAP) configured MH-60s that the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) flies. A 160th SOAR MH-60M in the Direct Action Penetrator configuration using the latest Multi-Station Lightweight Armament Support Structure (MLASS) stub wings. Hellfire missiles, as well as rocket pods and a 30mm M230 automatic cannon, are seen loaded on the pylons., United Composites With the Z-20 slated to become one of, if not the primary helicopter PLAGF service, it’s not necessarily a surprise to see the service at least testing the helicopter in new roles. Armed Z-20s could provide valuable additional firepower for conventional airmobile operations, as well as during more specialized operations. It’s important to remember that the Russian-made Mi-17s that these helicopters are to supersede, at least to some degree, are also capable of being armed with rocket pods, missiles, and other weapons using stub wings mounted on either side of their fuselage. An interesting, but low-quality picture of a PLAGF Mi-17 loaded with TY-90 air-to-air missiles., via Chinese Internet With the helicopter apparently still under test, at this stage it is unclear if the missile-armed Z-20 variant will eventually find a place within the PLAGF’s order of battle. If and when they do, we may then get a better idea about what kinds of missions are envisaged for this intriguing development of China’s Black Hawk clone.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Feb 14, 2021",The Navy Got Its Hands On Its First Operational F-4 Phantom Sixty Years Ago Today,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The extraordinary career of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II began exactly 60 years ago when a first example was handed over to the U.S. Navy to begin training aviators on the “Bent Wing Wonder.” That delivery launched a monumental run for the classic Cold War-era fighter, in the hands of three U.S. services and a multitude of foreign operators. The curtain only finally came down on the Phantom’s U.S. military service in 2016, an event that The War Zone marked here . It was Fighter Squadron 121 (VF-121), the “Pacemakers,” that had the honor of inducting the first Phantoms to see military service anywhere in the world. Back on December 30, 1960, VF-121 took charge of its first F4H, as the Phantom was then known, the fighter being delivered from the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, in St. Louis, Missouri, to the squadron’s home at Naval Air Station Miramar , California. It was not until September 1962 that the Phantom received its more familiar F-4 designation under the tri-service system of nomenclature. VF-121 “Pacemakers” eventually traded its early-production Phantoms for the much-improved F-4J model, an example of which returns to Miramar in 1978., U.S. Navy These very first Phantoms for VF-121 were the F4H-1F model, known as the F-4A from 1962 on, only 45 of which were manufactured. That’s a relative drop in the ocean compared to the 5,195 examples of the F-4 eventually built, not just in the United States but also in Japan, where the type has only just been withdrawn from frontline use . Meanwhile, in Greece , Iran, Turkey , and South Korea, the Phantom still soldiers on. As the first recipient of the big new all-weather fighter, the role of VF-121 “Pacemakers” was tasked to train up pilots and radar intercept officers (RIOs) for the Phantom, as the West Coast Fleet Replacement Air Group (RAG), or schoolhouse for the type. Since the Phantom added a RIO the training effort was increased proportionately — a second crewmember had not featured in a U.S. Navy fighter cockpit since the subsonic F3D Skyknight around a decade earlier. The job of the RIO was to operate the sophisticated Phantom’s Westinghouse radar, part of a space-age avionics suite that also boasted a Raytheon missile fire-control system, advanced navigation kit, and an analog air-data computer. An idea of the caliber of the newly minted Phantom aviators coming out of VF-121 is provided by Commander Charles “Pete” Conrad and Lieutenant Richard F. “Dick” Gordon , both of whom went from training with the “Pacemakers” to taking part in the Apollo 12 moon mission. Another McDonnell product, the F3H Demon was still flown by the VF-121 “Pacemakers” when its first Phantoms began to arrive., U.S. Navy Over on the East Coast, the equivalent RAG was VF-101, the “Grim Reapers,” at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, a detachment of which had actually separated and moved to Miramar to become VF-121 in advance. Aside from the two crewmembers, the Phantom was already a huge advance over the F3H Demon and F11F Tiger that the “Pacemakers” had operated until now. It was significantly bigger and more powerful — with twin engines, rather than a single one. Despite lacking the planned J79-GE-8 turbojets, even the interim GE-2 series engines in the F4H-1F each provided over 16,000 pounds of thrust with afterburning, capable of propelling it to speeds in excess of Mach 2. In terms of armament, the Phantom was designed without a gun, relying instead on guided missiles, an oversight that would have to be addressed after the jet was thrown into the close-quarters combat of the Vietnam War. The same conflict saw the F-4 emerge as a true multirole platform, perhaps the first of its kind, carrying a greater quantity of more varied weapons than any of its contemporaries. The early days of Phantom flying were hazardous, however. The first prototype F4H-1 crashed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in October 1959, during a workup sortie for an attempt on the world speed record, claiming the life of test pilot Gerald “Zeke” Huelsbeck . F4H-1 Phantom II Bureau Number 142259 was the aircraft lost in the October 1959 crash that killed test pilot Gerald “Zeke” Huelsbeck., San Diego Air and Space Museum Then, in May 1961, Commander J. L. Felsman was killed while conducting a high-speed low-level run in an early-production F4H-1. This crash, and another at Patuxent River, Maryland, both carried the hallmarks of pilot-induced oscillation, or PIO, when excessive pilot inputs on the flight controls led to the aircraft vibrating, effectively shaking itself apart. Among the first at VF-121 to get their hands on the Navy’s new Phantom was Commander Wilbur Norton, who reflected on the jet’s teething troubles: The Phantom itself was remarkably stable. Indeed, the stability of the design was a remarkable improvement over what we were flying then. But those who were ham-fisted would overcontrol the Phantom, or overcorrect if something went awry. The aircraft would then oscillate like mad. The best way to get out of this high-vibration problem is to remove your hands from the controls and just watch. At high altitude, you can recover easily. At low altitude, PIO is instant death. Ultimately, the PIO reflected not any inherent failing in the basic design of the Phantom but had more to do with pilots learning to adapt to the intricacies of this extraordinarily high-powered machine. The training syllabus at the RAGs was adapted accordingly, emphasizing a light touch on the controls, even when throwing the jet around in simulated combat. A camouflaged F-4G of VF-121 at Miramar in 1966. Only 12 of this Phantom model were converted from F-4Bs, with data link system, and other changes. , U.S. Navy The early experience with the Phantom goes to show that even the creation of a thoroughbred is not without its difficulties, with airframes and lives lost in high-profile accidents. By February 1962, however, the F4H-1 was ready to go to sea for the first time in an operational capacity, when VF-102 went aboard the USS Enterprise (CVAN-65). The most advanced aircraft carrier in the world — then on its shakedown cruise — made a suitable perch for the Phantom, which would soon establish itself as the pre-eminent naval fighter before going on to forge an equally successful career on land.

Kevin Noonan and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 30, 2020",Reflections And Wisdom From A Cold War Submarine Hunter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. From overcoming his fears and personal roadblocks in order to master the complex art of submarine hunting to heading out on his first carrier cruise and working to fit into the Navy’s unique squadron culture to chasing-down Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean during the twilight of the Cold War, Kevin Noonan has strapped us into an S-3 Viking right beside him and has taken us on a thrilling ride. Now, in this fourth and final installment in our Confessions Of An Ancient Sub Hunter series, Noonan reflects on what was and what could have been for the enigmatic S-3, as well as the challenges looming on the horizon for the U.S. Navy’s shrunken anti-submarine warfare community and for the service overall. We talk everything from secretive ES-3A Shadows, short-lived US-3A ‘Miss Piggies,’ how the Viking and her crews fought to make a name for themselves within the carrier air wing, the relevancy of the aircraft carrier in modern warfare, and what it is really like being the ‘guy in the back’ of a combat jet. So, strap back in, spool-up the turbofans, and prepare to launch! An S-3 Viking armed with Mk 20 Rockeye cluster munitions is about to roar off the carrier’s bow., US Navy The Viking’s Place In The Carrier Air Wing Pecking Order ‘Harpooning’ the Viking will meet another criticism of the aircraft made by traditional carrier aviators, who feel that the embarkation of fixed-wing ASW aircraft has compromised the concept of the attack carrier, and reduced its striking power . – An Illustrated Guide to Modern Naval Aviation and Aircraft Carriers With the decommissioning of the Essex class anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers and the introduction of the S-3 to the supercarriers, deck space that was already at a premium was now jealously coveted. Fighter and attack guys, as well as carrier skippers and air wing commanders (CAGs), wanted as many F-4s, F-14s, A-4s, A-6s, and A-7s as possible to carry out the mission of the attack carrier. The presence of a handful of E-2s, EA-6Bs, and helicopters was tolerated since they served their masters well. The Viking, however, really did nothing to enhance their concept of the warfare they were charged with conducting. So, can you imagine what these gentlemen were thinking in the early to mid-1970s when a squadron of ten S-3 Vikings suddenly invaded their sacred deck-space? A vertical view of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63). Visible on the flight deck are the following aircraft: an H-46 Sea Knight helicopter, foreground, two A-7 Corsair IIs, and S-3 Viking, two E-2 Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning (AEW), center, aircraft, an F-14 Tomcat and S-3 Viking and five EA-6B Prowler aircraft, background. Circa 1983., US National Archives Just to give you an idea of how much space, here are the S-3’s sexy measurements: Her wingspan was 68 feet with the wings spread or 29 feet with them folded. Her length was 53 feet. She stood tall at almost 23 feet, or 15 feet with her tail folded. By the way, at the apex of wings’ spreading or folding, the height of the Viking was 31 feet! Among the punishments doled out for our excessive presence on the sovereign four and a half acres of fighter-attack territory, administered to all VS squadrons upon entering the Med [the Mediterranean Sea], was the banishment of two or three of our birds to the purgatory of Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily. What they assumed was punishment was actually a two to three-week vacation from the boat. We would change-out aircraft and crews and maintenance personnel in order to give everyone a chance to ‘suffer.’ Ya know? I never did thank CAG and the fighter-attack guys for this! If there was a submarine in the general vicinity of Sicily, we would go out for a hunt. Otherwise, tasking while at ‘Sig’ tended to focus on recon of the Soviet anchorage just off of Tunisia or tracking the various ships the Soviets sent into the Med that steamed past Sicily. Unfortunately, far worse for our reputation than the obesity of our presence on the carrier was that perennial problem plaguing the “A” model of the S-3, the one I touched on above. Give me a moment to shed a little more light on the subject: Since the technology placed in the Viking by Univac and Texas Instruments was cutting-edge for a carrier-based aircraft, our computer took a long time getting used to the standard-issue violence any aircraft endured during a catapult launch or arrested landing. Industry, engineers and NAVAIR evaluators at Pax River [Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland] worked hard to eliminate the software and hardware problems that came to light as flight hours mounted through the 1970s. However, they never were able to completely cure a painfully regular problem associated with our Tape Transport Cartridge (TTC). F/A-18 Hornet and S-3 Viking sharing an elevator on a carrier during nighttime. , USN Basically, the TTC was a “floppy” disk that booted up the aircraft computer and had relevant software that could be loaded by the ASMOD [Anti-Submarine Modules, an intelligence element that coordinates ASW operations] for the pending mission (ESM [electronic support measures] emitters, target data, Link 11 info, fly-to-points, etc.). If we had any problems with the load while on deck, we’d shut down the #2 engine and one of our amazing AXs or ATs would come in and troubleshoot. The AX rating was an electronics technician that focused on our ASW black boxes. The ATs were electronics technicians that focused on aircraft electronics other than ASW gear. As the Cold War came to an end, the AX rating was retired and absorbed into the AT rating. Keep in mind, we normally flew with a regular Air Wing cycle, which meant we launched with the E-2 ahead of perhaps four Tomcats, five A-6s, and four A-7s. If our troubleshooting took too long, the fighters and attack birds would launch ahead of us. When a problem didn’t get resolved, we were now affecting deck spotting for the previous cycle that had been waiting in the overhead stack to recover. Once we did launch, then everyone kept their fingers crossed that the computer’s load would hold. Many times it didn’t. The utter shock the aircraft suffers at the end of the cat stroke makes every airplane tremble. Can you imagine, then, how it is for any sensitive electronics on board? This is what occurred with each launch for the GPDC [general purpose digital computer] in the S-3A. As late as 1987, we were required to inform the Air Boss or Alpha X-ray of the status of our load once we were airborne: Alpha – fully working system. Bravo or Charlie – computer working in degraded state with only some sensors working. Delta – no computer load. When we reluctantly reported a Delta load, you could hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth in the voice of the Air Boss or Alpha X-ray. Essentially, we were just a hunk of aluminum boring holes in CAG’s sky. If he was having a really bad day, he’d tell the Air Boss to send us to “Delta overhead and await the next recovery,” which meant we had to fly a purgatorial pattern above the ship and burn precious Air Wing fuel until we could land again. Our lack of a system meant no ESM, no radar except in an analog mode that couldn’t provide the battle group with any Link 11 surface plot data since the computer wasn’t working, no acoustics, nothing. An Air Anti-submarine Squadron 21 (VS-21) S-3A Viking aircraft comes in for a landing on the flight deck of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65) during FLEET EX ’88. The Enterprise is seen here operating near Adak, Alaska., US National Archives It took a long time for the S-3 to earn the respect she deserved. I’ve since discovered that there was a move in NAVAIR during the late ‘70s to early ‘80s to remove the S-3 from the carrier deck altogether and modify the airframes to be permanent tankers, CODs [Carrier Onboard Delivery], and a design to replace the Whale [the A-3 Skywarrior], all things that would actually come to pass. Thankfully, the complete removal didn’t happen. Someone somewhere was fighting for us—at least they were back then. As the prominence of Vietnam-era dogfights and airstrikes faded with the close of the ‘70s and the increasing Soviet threat to the carrier battleground (CVBG) invaded the minds of senior officers, attitudes toward the Viking did begin to change. Then, as the decade of the ‘80s came to a close, significant changes were made to the S-3. Each of these changes, such as an exciting new radar, supplying the fighter-attack guys with the sweet nectar of JP-5 jet fuel from our own loins, and the Harpooning of the Viking, would contribute to the removal of the chip on the shoulder of the Air Wing and carrier toward the S-3, for the most part, anyway. Aboard some carriers, the Viking community would actually experience genuine respectful admiration, and dare I say…love? Most importantly, damning computer loading problems would vanish. Vikings Onboard It took time for the ship’s company and air wing crews to get used to the presence of the S-3 Viking squadrons. We adapted, and by the time I walked aboard the USS Nimitz at the end of 1986 and headed off for my first Med cruise, the Viking community was just another squadron in the sea of 5000-6000 sailors aboard. They certainly didn’t love us — nonetheless, we were family. Onboard Nimitz , we were well established with our ready room, our maintenance spaces, and our berthing. Most importantly, to the AWs (Aviation Warfare Systems Operators) of VS-24, we had our own aircrew shop where we held shop meetings, did our various collateral duties, got our asses chewed out by the Chief, “smoked and Coked,” and played computer games on the shop’s Commodore 64…Yes, you read that right. As aircrew, we didn’t suffer the 12 hours on, 12 hours off schedule that our squadron mates and ship’s company had to endure every day we were at sea. We lived according to our flight schedule. An S-3 crewman boards the jet., US National Archives During a Med cruise, an AW Shop tended to have between 14 and 17 Naval aircrewman. With 10 aircraft, we could man the birds, day and night, and still have three SENSOs [sensor operators] to stand Assistant Squadron Duty Officer watch in the ready room. When we weren’t briefing and flying, we were sleeping, training, and studying Soviet naval vessel recognition and tactics or doing our collateral duties such as filling out all the squadron aircrew log books, calculating crew/aircraft flight time and mission statistics, updating classified publications and NATOPS manuals. My berthing aboard the Nimitz was particularly amazing. It was a 20 man-berth that was curtained off. It was our own sanctuary that was essentially off-limits to everyone. We could sleep day or night without interruption. I was grateful that I had a top rack (what the Navy calls a bed) that lay longitudinally along the ship’s axis. It takes heavy weather to make a 100,000-ton ship move and when we were sailing through a storm, my bunk would rock me into a magnificent slumber. On a particular set of nights in the Western Mediterranean in early 1987, I was able to listen to a lullaby of our escorts’ bow-mounted SQS-26 sonars pinging through the water and the steel of our hull while we passed through a winter storm. It was pure heaven! As I described above, all of this would change when we joined the brand new Theodore Roosevelt . I would never again enjoy the steel sanctuary and sense of a familiar old friend that the Nimitz was. I miss her. Surprisingly, during the two cumulative years I spent at sea over a four-year period, my carrier only went to General Quarters (GQ)—or battle stations—one time. Aboard the Theodore Roosevelt , we had a fire erupt in the auxiliary diesel engine room. The fire was quickly contained and put out by the outstanding Damage Control (DC) teams. Our blackshoe brethren were, for the most part, despised by the brownshoes—or aviation Navy—and vice versa. We rarely appreciated how often they saved our asses. All of our other GQs were only exercise or training events. We used to have a standard joke: “When the carrier goes to battle stations, the air wing goes to bed”—or hides in our respective ready rooms. It was a pain in the ass to move around the ship since everywhere you went you technically had to get Damage Control (DC) Central’s permission to move and all the hundreds of water-tight doors were dogged down. If you did venture out of the ready room on your way to the flight deck to fly a mission, you had to step over members of the DC teams that were spread across the carrier on every deck. Now, years later, and in light of what the USS Stark , Samuel B. Roberts , Cole , Fitzgerald , and McCain have suffered, I deeply regret not participating in these evolutions with the DC Teams. Had we collided with another ship, or received actual combat damage aboard my two carriers, we in the air wing would not have been prepared to help save our boat—just as the major carrier fires aboard USS Forrestal , Oriskany , and Enterprise had confirmed. Crew members practice firefighting techniques while another crew member acts as a simulated casualty during a general quarters drill aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71). An Air Anti-submarine Squadron 32 (VS-32) S-3A Viking aircraft is parked in the background. Circa 1987., US National Archives Overall, life aboard an aircraft carrier was incredibly generous and, despite our bitchin’ while at sea, it was a truly fortunate experience for those of us who were aircrew. The Viking’s Shadow I left the Navy before I had a chance to see one of the two most successful variants of the S-3, the ES-3A Shadow. It was my understanding that, at the time, you had to have a Top Secret (TS) clearance to simply climb up inside her cockpit. The vast majority of AWs only had a secret clearance until a TS became mandatory in the early ‘90s. My one connection with this mysterious aircraft came when I was an instructor. Since no Shadow airframes were available at the time, the first class of enlisted backseaters needed to be trained in emergency egress procedures, inflight safety, and the operation of two of the sensors that the ES-3A would retain from her first life as a Viking – the APS-137 radar and the ESM suite. After classroom training, we took each of them on a single familiarization hop in the backseat of one of our S-3Bs. Because of my lack of experience with this beautiful mutation of the Viking family—I’m a sucker for airplanes with all kinds of tumorous growths on them—I have to rely on the always-excellent work done by Squadron Signal Publications in their book S-3 Viking In Action by Brad Elward. His section on the Shadow is probably the best available. I highly recommend this particular text for its collection of magnificent pictures and outstanding info contained within a very short 80 pages. Actually, I just missed seeing the ES-3A by a few months since the USN chose to do field conversions at NAS Cecil Field instead of at the Lockheed plant. Sixteen Viking airframes were chosen to morph into the Shadow. While the basic bones remained, it was quite obvious that she was nothing like her old ASW/ASuW [Anti-Submarine Warfare/Anti-Surface Warfare] self. An Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 (VX-1) ES-3A Shadow aircraft sits on an elevator on the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-60) during the NATO exercise Display Determination ’92., US National Archives The Navy decided in the late ‘80s to end the long career of its only carrier-based signals intelligence (SIGINT) aircraft, the EA-3B “Whale.” They didn’t have an immediate replacement but Lockheed offered their concept of the ES-3 to replace the ongoing need for the gathering of electronic intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT) for the battlegroup. The USN accepted the concept and awarded the contract. The Navy, which loved to tinker with aircraft already in its inventory, was wooed by Lockheed’s major selling point: the Viking’s airframe had proven itself inherently stable and reliable over the previous decade and a half. That foundation allowed for non-disruptive modifications, such as the removal of the sonobuoy chutes and the MAD [ magnetic anomaly detector ] boom. Of course, the nature of the Shadow’s missions required significant additions of displays, devices, and the black boxes that ran them. Space inside the aircraft was carved out for these critical boxes with the removal of the acoustic processing equipment, which took up most of the left side of the avionics tunnel. However, it wasn’t near enough room. More carving took place in the weapons bay, where a full suite of electronics replaced the space normally reserved for torpedoes and bombs. This exponential increase in electrons and heat would require an even better cooling source than what the original Viking design offered, so a vapor cycle system “was installed to provide air conditioning for the new electronics in the bay and to sanitize moisture and salt from the aircraft to reduce corrosion,” writes Elward. Her ESM was upgraded as were her communications and navigation capabilities. The old GPDC was replaced with not one, not two, but with three computers. Elward continues: “Finally, the Shadow incorporated the Multi-Static Processor (MPS), which gave the ES-3A a passive airborne exploitation capability in the same league as the larger EP-3E and RC-135 Rivet Joint.” The crew changed as well. Instead of the Viking’s three officers and one enlisted aircrew, the Shadow had a pilot who was the Electronic Warfare (EW) mission commander and an NFO (Naval Flight Officer) who was the EW [Electronic Warfare] Combat Coordinator (EWCC) upfront. Behind the front seaters, two enlisted aircrewmen occupied the rear cockpit. If the mission was primarily COMINT, a Naval Aircrewman qualified as a cryptologist technician (CTI) would fly. If it was primarily ELINT, an EW Operator (EWOPS) would occupy one or both of the rear seats. The addition of all the bells and whistles came at the cost of 4,000 additional pounds, making the aircraft considerably more sluggish. Regardless, the ES-3A performed her SIGINT missions for the CSG commander and was called upon to execute additional tasks, such as Overland Battle Damage Assessment (OBDA) and Over-The-Horizon Targeting (OTH-T), all-the-while keeping the air wing in the gas by retaining her much-needed tanker capability.

This aircraft was retired to the AMARC as 2S0036 on 24 February 1999 and scrapped on 8 January 2003., USN Another critical mission that the Shadow performed for the CSG was assessing combat electronic order of battle (EOB), in which threat emitters and other enemy RF [radio frequency] sources would be categorized, mapped, and potentially exploited by the CVBG. Elward describes just such a mission: Typically, Shadows flew missions at high altitudes at long standoff range gathering information about enemy air defense networks, listening to communications, and helping identify and classify potential targets. Shadows often worked together with S-3Bs to create an overall EOB. Due to the limited number of ES-3As in the detachment, Shadows would often fly a mission along a designated route, followed by an S-3B Viking using its ESM suite and then compare data obtained from the two flights before making a second Shadow flight where the ES-3A would fine-tune the observations. The Shadow joined the fleet in 1992, with the birds going to one of two squadrons on each coast of the US. Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron (VQ-5), the Sea Shadows , was established initially at Guam and later was transferred to NAS North Island in 1994. In April of 1993, VQ-5 made the first operational deployment of the ES-3A aboard USS Independence . The east coast stood up VQ-6, the Black Ravens , at NAS Cecil Field with the first deployment aboard USS Saratoga in January of 1994. The ES-3A Shadow flew operationally, including working with NATO operations in Bosnia, until 1999 when “costs and budgetary constraints” ended what should have been a remarkable aircraft’s long career. With its loss, CSG commanders would have to rely on land-based EP-3E assets and USAF aircraft to meet their ever-increasing SIGINT needs. The Shadow airframes, now joined by their Viking kin, rest on a plot of desert Bone Yard in a world no longer at peace. Once again, one has to question the USN’s decision-making process and lack of foresight. Of course, budgetary myopia seems always to trump common sense, simple wisdom, and the unheeded lessons history keeps trying to teach us. Miss Piggy Obviously, with the transition from the propeller-driven S-2 to the jet-powered S-3 Viking, the C-1A Trader variant of the Tracker that served as the primary Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft would have to be replaced, as well. Lockheed, seeing a chance to take a chunk out of Grumman’s dominance of carrier deck space which included the C-2A Greyhound, offered a variation of the S-3 airframe. Surprisingly, the USN awarded the contract in 1975 for six US-3A CODs. Lockheed decided to make use of the seventh YS-3A airframe, stripping out all mission electronics. Since no passenger-now-prisoner of a crashing airplane would be pleased with having their flight crew leave them behind via pyrotechnics, the Viking’s four ejection seats were removed. A U.S. Navy Lockheed US-3A Viking (BuNo 157995) from Fleet Logistic Support Squadron 50 (VRC-50), the “Foo Dogs,” prepares to be launched from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) on 21 January 1987. The Viking BuNo 157995 was originally delivered as a YS-3A research and development aircraft and converted to a US-3A in the late 1970s. It was retired to AMARC as 2S0034 on 29 January 1996 and scrapped in 2003., USN In their place, a pilot, co-pilot, a loadmaster, and up to six rear-facing passenger seats were installed. Cargo space was carved out of the weapons bay and two big cargo-carrying blivets could be slung under each wing station in place of fuel tanks. In lieu of passengers, additional cargo could be carried internally for a total capacity of 7,400 pounds.  However, the addition of the blivets reduced her range from 2,700 nautical miles to just over 1,900 nautical miles, which was still very substantial. Was Miss Piggy , as her crews and the fleet affectionately called her, a worthy replacement of the Trader? While the C-1A could carry up to nine passengers, it could only carry 3,500 pounds of cargo. As I mentioned above, the USN already had a COD aircraft, a variant of the E-2 Hawkeye. The C-2 Greyhound became operational in 1965, a full decade before the Viking variant contract was awarded. Its two Allison T-56 turboprops could haul 10,000 pounds of cargo, including outsized aircraft engines, personnel, and most importantly to the CVBG sailor, mail . Clearly, the Greyhound could do the job better. Flight and ground crewmen unload cargo from US-3A “Miss Piggy’s” giant blivet. Circa 1981., US National Archives So, why did the USN choose to utilize Miss Piggy ? I really don’t have a clue. Add to the mystery that the US-3s were limited to the west coast Navy and flew only in the 7th Fleet area of operations out of Subic Bay in the Philippines or Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Also, the only squadron that flew the six aircraft was the Foo Dogs of VRC-50—“VRC” being the designation for Fleet Logistics Support Squadron. When I find an answer as to what the Navy was thinking with the US-3A, I’ll let you know. A Premature Demise? A couple of times a month I’m asked if the decision by the U.S. Navy to retire the S-3 Viking in 2009 was a mistake. One conclusion I have drawn, while mulling over this critical question, is that there is a far more important consideration that is essentially ignored: “Was the resolution to remove the SENSO and the ASW mission equipment for which the Viking was originally designed, a fateful miscalculation?” This move, made nine years prior to the aircraft’s retirement, was symptomatic of the utter failure of the Navy to stay the course after the end of the Cold War on what arguably was and is its most important mission—anti-submarine warfare. Okay, so I got that small measure of bitching off my chest. Now, onto the larger issue of retiring the aircraft altogether. Was it a mistake for the Navy to do so? Should it bring the S-3 back to be a tanker and perform other missions? Are current ASW measures enough to protect the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) while performing the other ASW missions necessary to meet the “new” threat posed by the Russians, not to mention the Chinese—a threat that is relatively new but not unexpected? First, let me acknowledge just how ignorant the empowered minds had to be not to have seen how many hats the Viking had worn, and how many variants were theorized and produced from one, single, brilliant airframe. Of course, the ignorant aren’t completely to blame. The VS [air anti-submarine and sea control squadron] community had decades to develop a reputation, as the VP [patrol squadron] community did, and lobby for the life of the S-3. Our subordination in the air wing didn’t have to be an accepted limitation. Now, in a world filled with contradiction, allow me to add one of the many I own: It was a mistake to retire the S-3…and…it wasn’t a mistake. An air to air left side view of an Air Anti-submarine Squadron 31 (VS-31) S-3A Viking aircraft banking right. The Soviet command cruiser Zhdanov is underway in the background. Circa 1987., US National Archives It wasn’t, because at the time it did make fiscal sense – that is if you subscribe to the group who were quite certain that the end of history was upon us and we would all live happily ever after. However, Desert Storm, Bosnia, Somalia, and the planet changing effect of September 11th made it quite obvious that happily ever after is found only in naïve minds and fairy tales. Yet, less than a decade after the same euphoric thinking that pulled the SENSO out of the Viking reared its ugly head and made the myopic choice to remove the aircraft from fleet inventories altogether. That thinking failed to consider, with one eye in a history book, what was really going on in the world and how removing a critical in-flight refueling asset would affect the only strike mission aircraft left on the carrier’s deck. The Navy bought into the concept that there would always be a USAF tanker ready for the air wing to plug into, no matter where the carriers were in the world. This is the same thoughtless argument that believes a P-8 will always be overhead to protect every CSG and ESG while still having plenty of airframes to perform open ocean search and tracking of subsurface threats that, in the 21st Century, have slipped away from our convenient assumptions of how they’re supposed to behave. That’s not to mention the numerous other missions expected of the Poseidon. P-8 Poseidon seen during testing., USN A word about the P-8 and availability. Back in the day, if there was a potential submarine threat, VP (P-3 Orion squadron) support of a CVBG was mostly requested at night unless we were in a major ASW exercise. CAGs and carrier COs preferred daylight cyclical ops and needed the overnight time for maintenance and to rest their catapult and arresting gear crews. Because submarines never get the memo about the carrier’s preferred schedule, they tend to attack at all hours. Thus, it was painful getting the CAG and CO [commanding officer] to support 24-hour or “flex deck” ops allowing the S-3s, an E-2, and the helos to launch and address the all-hours schedule of the enemy submarine. Now that there are no fixed-wing ASW assets aboard the carrier at all, so the need for the P-8 has risen dramatically . A quick comparison is in order. Open source info tells me that a P-8 will be on station between four and six hours per mission depending on transit time. Also, according to data published in 2018, the U.S. Navy is planning on acquiring 117 Poseidons to handle the issues faced by a four ocean Navy that has to constantly attend to several seas and a troublesome Persian Gulf. Again, back in the day, at the height of the 1980s, there were 377 Orions spread across three oceans, several seas, and an increasingly disturbed Persian Gulf. The P-3 also tended to stay on station for an average of eight hours. Granted, as the open-source materials state, the P-8’s acoustic suite and sonobuoy load are significantly better—and they damn well better be—than what came before. I’ll also give you the 60 or so MQ-4 Tritons drones if you’ll assure me that they can meet the tactical ASW needs that will haunt CSGs in the decades to come (they aren’t really an ASW platform). Thus, when I do the availability math, taking into account all other sources of intel and ASW support…well…I’m worried. The P-8 flies alongside USS John C. Stennis . , USN I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “generals and admirals are always fighting the last war.” Well, we are confronted with a new Cold War with a decidedly 21st Century flair while preparing for the Cold War of the 20th Century without the funds and assets we used to dominate and win that one. Have I told you, lately, that I’m worried ? Should the Viking, then, be brought back into service? No. It’s too late for the USN. That decision should have been made and acted on by wise minds a few years after its retirement as the Navy witnessed how much wear and tear tanking contributed to the life expectancy of the Super Hornet. They should have stripped the airframe of all of its electronics, save the radar and ESM, and filled all the available spaces with gas. But, as many rightly point out, bringing the Viking back would become a fiscal nightmare because of the well-documented propensity of the Navy to add on all kinds of bells & whistles to fulfill every need they perceive the airframe should meet…including fixed-wing ASW. Now, let’s look at other ASW assets around the CSG in light of the Viking’s absence. There is the belief that all carriers have a nuclear fast attack submarine (SSN) supporting their deployment. Sorry, but here we go again with availability. That was nominally true during the latter part of the Cold War, but the number of Virginia class boats available today and in the foreseeable future don’t add up to the wide-ranging, burdensome needs now placed on the submarine community. What happens if there is a war with China and Russia supports their communist acquaintance? Let’s be honest, there is a desperate need for the primary missions the SSN fulfills, not to mention the need to keep pace with the steady growth of the worldwide diesel submarine threat and the intel gathering that is needed to understand what makes the Chinese Navy and others tick. And the SSN is still our only reliable asset in the Arctic even as seasonally navigable waterways open up for longer periods. Remember, along with the White Sea, this region still remains the safest place for Russian SSBNs to hide if we get into a protracted shooting war with that country. And if we do, those SSBNs have to go. Russian Borei class SSBN., Russian Government The surface navy is finally getting its ASW act together. In light of their self-imposed lack of simple sailoring skills, I really hope they are. The reality? Even if they were at the top of their game today , only having two or three destroyers protecting a CVN simply won’t be enough to meet the submarine threat. There have always been and will always be too many variables in hunting submarines that will quickly deplete the capabilities of two or three surface warships. Finally, the helicopter. I will always remind anyone who asks how two or three helicopters with dipping sonar are the very best air ASW threat to a submarine. However, let me qualify that statement with the fact that this is true only after the submarine has been localized. For these helos to be effective, the submarine’s general location must already be known, and in today’s and tomorrow’s environment, just like during the Cold War when we had assets a-plenty, a flaming datum may be the only way an initial detection is provided. Simply put, helicopters, by themselves, are not very good search platforms. Unless things have changed, a helo with a dipping sonar brings nothing to an initial search that the carrier’s escorts don’t already provide with their bow sonar in active mode—it is a waste of fuel, of crew endurance, and system use. Once a potential contact has been gained, then the helo is the ideal sub-hunting platform. A sonobuoy search by a helo is also a waste since only a relatively small number are carried and the helo’s range and relatively slow speed prevent it from meeting the typical demands of the search phase of ASW.  Oh, and there simply aren’t the numbers of helos aboard the ships of a CSG to perform all the missions expected of them while also performing a very time-consuming blind search. The helo’s range and speed actually pose a major threat to the carrier. The presence of an ASW helicopter not only informs a submarine skipper that there are major warships present, but ensures that they are close by. Not having any ASW sensors or weapons aboard, the carrier’s only self-defense against a submarine is to run away at relatively high-speed. An MH-60R Sea Hawk from the Raptors of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 71 assigned to the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) tests lower a dipping sonar. John C. Stennis is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of responsibility conducting maritime security operations, theater security cooperation efforts, and support missions for Operation Enduring Freedom. , USN While maritime geography and operational needs may tie an aircraft carrier to a certain, vulnerable location, her deployed helicopters hunting a submarine place additional leashes on an already exposed capital ship. The carrier must stay within the limiting range of its helos to ensure they can be safely recovered. I love helicopters, but in the current ASW environment, just one potential submarine will sponge away all available ships, aircraft, and sensors. When the second and third possible submarine contact is detected, God help the ASW commander. The loss of a sea-based fixed-wing “outer-zone” ASW aircraft has taken the USN back into the 1940s and 1950s where, in the vast majority of instances, they were forced to wait for the submarine to find them . If we are faced with a naval conflict against China and/or Russia, whether brief or protracted, the fog and chaos of war will exponentially add insult to the injury of “never enough assets” and create far too many flaming datums. Oh, and the real irony of today’s CSG? There is plenty of deck space these days for 10 Vikings on the supercarriers with their shrinking air wings. If I may: Laugh…out…fucking…loud! An S-3B Viking assigned to the “Diamond Cutters” of Sea Control Squadron Three Zero (VS-30), flies over an oil rig in the Arabian Gulf during flight operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)., USN Here’s how I see it: The Navy needs to gradually move away from total reliance on manned aircraft and begin to fill the decks of every ship in the Fleet, including auxiliaries, with all manner of unmanned air/surface/subsurface vehicles capable of performing each mission in any electronic environment. The irresistible movement toward this era of unmanned warfare is upon us whether we like it or not.  We have, and will have, the technology to not only create various types, shapes, and sizes of sensor/weapon-carrying vehicles, but to employ them in the battlespace that is being created by this era. Most importantly, and for the moment, it is a field of play where we, our friends, and our enemies are all new to the game. We need to move in this direction because every sea environment we enter will soon contain multiple subsurface threats of varying complexity. The CSG going through a choke point will not only face one, two, or three manned submarines in a layered defense, she will also face many mission-critical unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) that will accompany those submarines . Some of those UUVs will also find employment as decoys providing an almost perfect simulation of the host submarine’s acoustic and performance profile. Now, you have seven…no, 11 contacts! S-3B moving around the carrier deck., USN So, here’s my worried question: Are we even training for this environment today? Does the acoustic sensor operator in the MH-60 and P-8 know how to detect, classify, and track a UUV? Does a surface ship sonar tech have the know-how? At the very least, they damn well better be training the sonar techs who serve aboard submarines to do this. Instead of dismissing the navalized unmanned concept as “naive at best, delusional at worst,” we need to have the courage to accept that this is the natural evolution of naval warfare. After all, just a century ago the battleship admirals thought the same of the airplane and submarine. No Foreign Viking Adopters I am very disappointed that the Viking fleet continues to languish in the desert since its retirement. As I stated, I don’t think they are relevant to fulfill USN needs. However, I am surprised that Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, or even Australia haven’t purchased a clutch or two of them. The Viking’s range and endurance are perfect for the maritime geography that surrounds these countries. There is no question that Australia, for example, needs the P-8. However, they are costly and our good friends can only afford a limited number. Using an Aussie S-3 to cover her green and brown water would be a tremendous reduction of the burden a Poseidon-only fleet will have to carry. Just some of the S-3 Vikings in storage at AMARG. , Google Earth Despite arguments to the contrary, the Viking still has plenty of life in her and nations that would be able to use them wouldn’t be subjecting the airframes to the harsh aircraft carrier environment. The aircraft would make fantastic littoral MPAs (Maritime Patrol Aircraft) and with affordable non-acoustic and acoustic system/processor updates, could handle diesel, nuclear submarines, and UUVs with relative ease. Is The Aircraft Carrier Still Relevant? There’s a quote in my notes somewhere that argues against the aircraft carrier as being far too vulnerable in “modern naval warfare.”  The quote is from an article written in…wait for it… 1922 . Submarines have proven that carriers, and all surface ships for that matter, are vulnerable. Airplanes have proven that aircraft carriers are vulnerable. Very angry anti-ship cruise missiles, and now anti-ship ballistic missiles, have threatened the survivability of the carrier. But in any argument against or for the aircraft carrier, many factors come into play, the least of which is defining what vulnerability and survivability actually mean. And let’s face it, warships of any type at any time in history have always been vulnerable. One thing that needs to be recognized is that the majority of folks who emphasize the vulnerability of the aircraft carrier are also arguing about the incredibly high cost of building and operating them, and they are absolutely correct and right to do so. I’m torn by all sides of the argument having served aboard Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt during the aircraft carrier’s glory days. The Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group, including the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain (CG-57) and the guided-missile destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108) and USS Michael Murphy (DDG-112), operate with the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group including, USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), CVW-5, USS Shiloh (CG-67), USS Barry (DDG-52), USS McCampbell (DDG-85), USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62) and USS Mustin (DDG-89), and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ships (JS) Hyuga (DDH-181) and JS Ashigara (DDG-178) in the western Pacific region. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and U.S. Navy forces routinely train together to improve interoperability and readiness to provide stability and security for the Indo-Asia Pacific region., USN Degrees of carrier vulnerability have come and gone and come back again over the aircraft carrier’s century of existence. World War II showed how easy it was to sink them and how difficult it was. The examples set by the USS Forrestal , Enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the USS Oriskany showed how a carrier can survive conventional weapons explosions and resulting fires due to the persistence and sacrifice of damage control teams and the dedication of the ship’s crew. As opposed to land bases, the aircraft carrier is highly maneuverable and can take itself out of potential danger, or not go in harm’s way at all. The battlegroup commander can also pick and choose the level of risk he or she is willing to place their high-value assets in. Visual, electronic, and operational deception still works. The oceans and seas remain very large places to hide in despite modern technology. But things, they are a-changing. No one knows how effective Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles will be against the aircraft carrier. Have they perfected the targeting and maneuvering required to hit such a dynamic target? That is once they’ve found it? Do they have the resources and stamina to go after more than one carrier? Certainly, they invite capitalization of the carrier’s vulnerability if they pick and choose where the fight is going to be. If they get one carrier, will it escalate into a tactical nuclear war? Will it go further than that? Are they even afraid of this possibility in light of our current nuclear weapons theory and practice? And that leads to the “newest” problem faced by our current carrier fleet: area denial weapons being developed and utilized are, in theory, pushing the aircraft carrier further and further away from the potential fight and we aren’t helping the matter. By placing manned aircraft on the deck that have less and less range to do the traditional missions of the aircraft carrier, we are supporting the effective, fear-based tactic the Chinese are currently using with the deployment of the anti-ship ballistic missile and far-ranging air defense systems. One solution that has been argued for decades is to stop buying the supercarriers and start buying smaller ones . It is an important argument simply because the more assets you have, the more your enemy will face. But “smaller” invites a host of problems of its own to be dealt with. Reduced deck space limits the number and type of aircraft that can be flown off on missions. How is the smaller carrier powered? If it is conventionally powered, then you have to drag around more auxiliaries to ensure your higher number of carriers have the supplies, fuel, and gas they need. More carriers also need more crew, which means higher costs in manpower—one of the more expensive aspects of any military force. America’s newest carrier, CVN-78, USS Gerald R. Ford , cost roughly $13B and is still suffering from a number of issues., USN Today, the biggest problem with the larger number of small carriers argument is that anything touched by the military and industry mutates well beyond the original intent of design and cost. This frustrating neediness for all the latest “upgrades and apps” and a pathetic obsession with greed ends up bringing the costs into the neighborhood of the supercarrier. Meanwhile, we end up having ships originally designed to perform three missions, unable to perform any of the 32 missions we’ve added on. I love the concept of the smaller carrier. In my thinking, I believe it can work…but I also suffer from a case of severe nostalgia. In all honesty, I really don’t have an answer because there are so many factors and scenarios to consider. The aircraft carrier has served the United States very well as the peace-time political tool needed for influential diplomacy and power projection.  But so was the battleship up until 1939. In past wars, up to Desert Storm, aircraft carriers performed brilliantly. To meet the challenges of the rise of the Soviet Navy, particularly its submarine force, the aircraft carrier evolved and rolled very well with the punches. Today, the flat top remains, essentially the same; however, its actual weapon, the manned aircraft, has changed…for better?…for worse? As it has been said, repeatedly: a carrier’s true vulnerability relies on the range of its aircraft. Let’s hope the Super Hornet and F-35’s limited range can be “extended” by its amazing 21s Century capabilities. And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have hypersonic weapons… As a nation, we need to take the question of the future of the aircraft carrier seriously and find effective answers before one of those huge, nearly irreplaceable, intensively manned, and very costly assets meet their ultimate humiliation at the hand of a non-peer or peer state. Maritime Patrol In An Age Of Advanced Air Defenses The four nautical mile range ring. A seemingly benign symbol that surrounded another seemingly benign submarine symbol on our screens. Placed there by Viking TACCOs [Tactical Coordinators], it had begun to strike fear in the hearts of Viking crews in the 1980s and early 1990s. Our sense of invulnerability was coming to its end. Just remember, if you penetrate that circle, our Intel Officer admonished, you’re as good as dead! INDIAN OCEAN (Feb. 23, 2011) – Royal Australian Navy Collins -class submarine and Combat Aircrew 1 of Patrol Squadron (VP) 4 operate together to improve anti-submarine warfare interoperability during maritime patrol aircraft exercise (TAMEX). VP-4 is currently partnered with No. 11 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force conducting TAMEX exercise in Perth, Australia, designed to enhance maritime patrol interoperability between the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force., USN For most of the Cold War, the MPA and carrier-based ASW community flew with impunity in the skies around and above surfaced and submerged submarines. As World War II ended, deck guns were being traded for hydrodynamic sails and casings because, in a hostile environment, the submarine didn’t need to surface any more. All she had to do was stick her snorkel up to charge her batteries. Thus, we had no immediate threat to hinder our ability to perform our mission and stay close to the submarine. We did not have to fear AAA [anti-aircraft artillery] or SAMs [surface-to-air missiles] coming up from our targets simply because the stealth theory dominated the submariner’s mind. They preferred the depths. But then, somebody decided enough was enough: ASW aircraft had had far too much freedom. Four nautical miles… Today, MPA aircrews face range rings in the scale of hundreds of miles, depending on where in the world they are flying. Layers and layers of weapons-plus-geography are now being built in what appears to be our most serious theater of maneuver and warfare: the East and South China Seas. The Chinese played the role of student during most of the Cold War. They watched. They learned. The 20th Century has been an interesting and powerful classroom for them. With the fall of the Soviet Union and their own tremendous economic growth, they believe they’ve graduated and feel that the 21st Century belongs to them. They may not be wrong. One significant lesson they’ve learned from the US is the importance of dominating their hemisphere. Within that geographic hegemony, they are placing weapons such as the HQ-9, a variety of fighter aircraft with long-range air-to-air missiles, electronic air defense stations, and various anti-ship missile systems to prevent easy access to their overall strategic plan. In theory, these systems will push warships and aircraft carriers back beyond their effective ranges and threaten the bases and governments that allow allied MPAs and other, critical land-based assets to freely and easily perform crucial missions. At least in theory. In a world where technology demands a multi-platform approach to warfare, the MPA may not be able to penetrate the layers of defenses offered-up by the Chinese. Thus, we have to design and develop a new way of penetrating these defenses just as, in the past, every new weapon, tactic, and strategy was countered by another new weapon, tactic, and strategy. A P-8 Poseidon refueling high over the Mediterranean. , USN In the interim, there is good news—the Chinese can’t do this all at once. It will take time and we need to take advantage of that time. Also, as Tyler has pointed out , most recently in his Saudi oilfield attack , having the best air defense system doesn’t mean it’s going to work as advertised. While the Chinese are outstanding students, they haven’t fought a naval engagement or war since the late ‘70s, whereas, we have been on a war footing since 2001. And one of the greatest truths of warfare is that the defenders of any plot of land or area of the sea tend to fall into a malaise brought on by a false sense of security and superiority. Even better news—unlike the neighborhood in our hegemony, China’s neighbors don’t trust her, and Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea hate her, and are arming themselves to deal with her. Also, China is primarily interested in her global status as an economic power. It’s not about philosophical domination…just economic. Once she leaves the bastion of the East and South China Seas, she becomes just another blue water navy. There’s an old saying that is a profound truth: “Train like you fight; fight like you train.” MPA crews are going to have to continuously educate themselves on the Chinese theater of operations and train for the realities they will face. The men and women who man the P-8s, P-1s, P-3s, and other MPAs in the region need to speak up and offer ideas, concepts, and tactics to senior leadership about how they need to fight since they are the ones who are, and will be, actually doing the fighting. They just can’t rely on a playbook written by those who aren’t, or worse still, those who are preparing to fight the last war. The aircrewmen need to analyze and innovate about how to crack the Chinese shield and get in to perform their ASW and ASuW mission…and then get out alive. Being The Guy In The Back If I may, a word to any of you out there contemplating military aviation who are already bespectacled, don’t have a four-year degree, or have been told by a recruiter that you won’t make the pilot-cut: There is a reason that certain airplanes have more souls on board than that one guy who is pushing rudder pedals and flipping ailerons . That reason is that those airplanes are designed to do a mission only additional crewmembers can successfully complete. Despite not being the stars of Hollywood movies, the NFOs, WSOs, EWOs, AWs, SAR swimmers, boom operators, and yes, even loadmasters, complete the vital fabric of a complex and powerful weapon system. I mean, let’s face it, the only reason we remember Anthony Edwards’ character “Goose” is because he is a brilliant actor and was funny as hell in Top Gun. S ome other RIO stunk while poor, helpless Mav got yelled at by a really cool RIO who wore a really cool VF-111 helmet. It is worth pursuing, but it will cost you. The guys in the front get the most attention, but history is made in the back of the jet, as well. , USN If I may offer some advice: You have to become an expert at your job. Not only developing technical expertise, but a complete immersion into the tactics, the issues, and histories of the seat you’re occupying. Take advantage of every peripheral job, class, and opportunity that allows you to learn more about your weapon system and how it fits in with others within your own branch and all others of the US and Allied militaries. Also, and this is crucial, become the subject matter expert on the enemy you will face. You’ll be crewed with some very strong egos, which speaks to the need to come to the game with a strong sense of humility and a strong understanding of the purpose of your mission. Also, you will have to “grow a pair” in order to handle a world and attitude that subordinates you while happily glorifies the pilots. In many ways, like ole’ Goose, you’ll have to mother your pilots, and with larger crews, you’ll have to be a den mother. I had the honor of flying with some genuinely amazing NFOs who took their job very seriously and were also fantastic, humble human beings. Many of them admitted in our cockpit confessionals how they wanted to be pilots, but for various reasons didn’t make the cut. Instead, they motivated themselves to be the best and counted themselves fortunate to be crew members in an environment where history is made and every single day matters. Several of these tremendous souls went on to command S-3 squadrons, and one or two went on to skipper an aircraft carrier. One guy, Lieutenant ‘H,’ who was my all-time favorite division officer and a magnificent COTAC/TACCO, decided to change horses in midstream and become a SEAL. He was warned by the ‘upper management’ that his naval career was over. He didn’t care, he wanted to swim, jump out of airplanes and do neat shit every damn day . A year or so after he left, we actually called him one morning and you could hear the smile pulsating in his voice. After catching up, he said: “Boys, I just got back from a shooting exercise; good talking with you, but I gotta let you go because I’m off for bit o’ lunch and then a HALO [high-altitude, low-opening] jump out of a COD!” I recently read where he had retired a few years ago…at the rank of Captain with NFO wings and SEAL trident adorning one helluva naval career. Any branch of the military offers a universe full of opportunity and adventure. If you involuntarily (or voluntarily) decide to sit in the backseat of any aircraft, every day can be a treasure waiting to be unearthed—even those periods of time that will seem unbearably boring—and you will be blessed with plenty of those days. Most importantly, you will be given the opportunity to grow as a human being and become a leader, two qualities that will serve you well for the rest of your life. The challenge, however, belongs to you to make the very best of it. The flying gets done up front, but the mission largely takes place in the back., USN Two additional things. First, find a mentor and then be a mentor . Be a mentor even if your charge doesn’t want you to be there for him or her. But most of all, keep a photographic and written journal of each and every day of your life. I have lamented over and over again about the dearth of pictures that I have after being in the USN and flying in and working around some of the most historically awesome aircraft and warships the world has ever known. My pathetic handful of images haunt me every day. However, the most powerful specter has been my failure to write a detailed account, each day, of the things I encountered, experienced, and did. I’ve missed so many precise dates and explanations of events that I’ve related to you here and elsewhere because I just simply didn’t write them down. There are other events I’ve wanted to tell you about, but have had to exclude them because they are lost in the fog of time-past. In my research, I’ve encountered several pilots, who have briefly annotated notes in their logbooks describing what each particular flight accomplished. Why? WHY didn’t I think of that?! Please… PLEASE ! WRITE! Looking Forward I’ve enjoyed this journey back into all-things ASW, submarines, naval aviation, and Cold War history. It has sparked a passion within that I didn’t think I could find. Partial blame goes to Tyler and you guys for that fateful day I stumbled upon Foxtrot Alpha in April of 2015. I was introduced to a community where the writer loves all-things military tech and is in love with military aviation while being stalked by an informed, witty, snarky, and faithful group of readers, detractors, stalkers, and bots whose comments and feedback are truly second-to-none. But it was Tyler’s article in September of that year on the possibility that South Korea might purchase a few Viking airframes that enlightened me to a hunger out there for the amazing history and stories of the great souls who created, developed, and operated the weapons and systems that have fought for an always-tenuous peace. Kevin alongside his beloved S-3 Viking., Kevin Noonan Another important place for me has been Twitter . Like TWZ, I have been away from there far too long and look forward to making more time for posts and conversation. I have had the honor of encountering a world of people who appreciate an unamended picture of a Cold War airplane, warship or submarine. It has been such a powerful experience to receive responses from the vets that actually served aboard them back then. I have been genuinely humbled by the kindness of those individuals who have befriended me…particularly an old RC-135 driver, a couple of Royal Navy submariners and skippers, some authors and writers, and a former Soviet Naval officer, who I hope Tyler interviews someday. I also received a gift of a private memoir from one of the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine skippers who fought his boat during the Falklands War. It is a treasure I keep close to me and will carry it with my ashes, one day, on that final journey back to the sea. I have decided to slowly, but fully pursue a long-lost love of mine—writing.  As an airborne ASW operator, I stood on the shoulders of some tremendous souls who designed, developed, and flew the history that prepared me to perform my late Cold War mission. Their stories and the stories of their stunning creations need to be told. Along with writing several histories related to Cold War ASW, I’d like to take a crack at naval fiction. Between now and then, in an effort to bring my writing up to par, I’m working on a variety of articles covering a wide range of popular as well as obscure subjects. In my reading, I’m encountering tremendous things that have happened that are lost to history and deserve a second look. I am deeply grateful to Tyler for giving me this opportunity to spill some of the beans and your willingness to read it. All of you here at TWZ mean more to me than I can articulate. Thank you all for allowing me to reminisce. USN In case you missed it, you can read the other three parts of the Confessions Of An Ancient Sub Hunter series linked in order here , here , and here .

It was a time of peak naval aviation of sorts, with President Reagan’s military buildup having drastically expanded the Navy’s fleet , the movie Top Gun having become a pop culture sensation , and the Soviet Union sputtering towards its eventual collapse. To call it a colorful time in military and world history would be a vast understatement. It was here, during the twilight of the Cold War, that Kevin Noonan found himself hunting submarines from the cabin of a carrier-based S-3 Viking. We followed Noonan through the trials and tribulations of training and learning the shadowy art of chasing submarines from the sky. Then went along with him on his first cruise aboard an aircraft carrier where we got a full understanding of how he plied his deadly sub-hunting trade. Now, in this the third part of our four-part exclusive series, we strap-in beside Kevin to see not only him, but also his beloved mount, the S-3 Viking, mature into wiser and more potent weapons of war. Back To The Boat After a major deployment, a carrier and its air wing tended to get a solid month of rest—rest being a relative term. At the squadron, during the first days at home, our sister squadrons would stand our hangar and Squadron Duty Officer (SDO) watches. But even for the first month, we operated with a skeleton crew with many of the squadron members on leave and a good portion more being transferred to their next duty station. Some, after a Mediterranean (Med) cruise, were more than happy to get out of the Navy if their enlistment was up. Those fools! We did very little flying during the first month back home at NAS Cecil Field. In fact, a returning squadron sometimes gave up their best birds to the squadron that was in line to deploy next. Other aircraft, particularly the notoriously broken ‘hangar queens,’ might be sent for major repair at a high-level maintenance station. My impression of this time around was that I had somehow rejoined the Naval Reserves! It was so quiet, but neither squadron nor aircraft carrier rests for long. Oh, wait, we no longer had an aircraft carrier, at least for the time being. S-3 Vikings based at NAS Cecil Field flying over Jacksonville, Flordia in 1988., USN It was one hell of an interesting culture shock when we arrived aboard the then-latest Nimitz class aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) in February of 1988. She was to be Air Wing Eight’s (CAG-8) new home. One might think that one Nimitz class carrier is the same as any other Nimitz class carrier. They, however, would be wrong. Granted, the various decks remain the same and to the untrained eye, the ship’s outward appearance seems the same, but the personality of the ship, her crew, and the ship’s ‘soul’ are entirely different. My fellow enlisted Naval Aircrewmen (AWs) and I of Sea Control Squadron 24 (VS-24) “Scouts” were excited to be aboard a brand-new boat. That is, until we discovered we did not have a special aircrew berthing or a space for our aircrew shop. Misery quickly set in. No one from CAG-8 had bothered to think about the needs of VS-24 other than the acquisition of Ready Room Four that occupied the same deck and spaces we had aboard Nimitz , as well as the maintenance shops required to allow our squadron to function. If memory serves, they failed to provide us with a place for our Personnel Department as well. As a result, that misery quickly transformed into being pissed off. A squadron ready room aboard a Nimitz class carrier circa 1988. , USN For our aircrew shop, we ended up getting a paint storage space…that had no air conditioning and no heat. We’d be in the Caribbean in a few days and above the Arctic Circle in a few months. Worse still, we ended up sharing sleeping spaces on the O-3 level that berthed over a hundred other sailors in the stern or in the bow. We moved back and forth between these two locales several times over the next two years. The space in the bow was the most difficult to adjust too. That berthing lay just beneath the bow catapults. Every time an aircraft would be launched, we’d be entertained with resonating sound of the shuttle running the length of catapult track ending with a powerful ‘THUMP!’ as it stopped at the water brake. If we slept, it was a fitful, angry sleep. It may sound like I’m whining, but aircrew sleeping habits were dictated by NATOPS (Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization) and we actually needed a small, isolated space like we had on Nimitz that allowed us to sleep around the clock since we flew around that clock. Granted, we couldn’t avoid the bow catapult sounds and the Air Wing’s ‘Officer Country’ sleeping area was also in the bow on the 0-3 level, so us enlisted guys weren’t subject to that issue alone. What we could have avoided was the noise made by a whole bunch of sailors coming and going throughout the day and night slamming stand-up and coffin lockers, laughing, and doing the things tired sailors do. Yes, this is me…still whining some 30 years later! Otherwise, “ TR ” was a really great ship. Over the months ahead we adjusted to the black shoe crew (those that ran the ship), and they to us, and learned to commune with the spirit of this brand new, mighty aircraft carrier. The culture shocks kept coming, however. On the flight deck, an airplane that looked suspiciously like a lawn dart had replaced that lovable, combat-proven Short Little Ugly Fucker, or SLUF, that was also known as the A-7 Corsair II. No longer did we share the flight deck with the Marauders of VA-82 and Sidewinders of VA-86. F/A-18 Hornet taking to the catapult aboard the ‘TR.’ , USN After a week or so of carrier qualifications for all the air wing aircraft, including the hybrid fighter-attack squadrons VFA-15 ‘Valions’ and VFA-87 ‘Golden Warriors’ and their shiny, new, low-viz grey F/A-18 Hornets, we headed to the Gitmo Op Area (just off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba ) for a shakedown cruise. Although it took time, ship and air wing began to find a mutual rhythm. Oh, here’s something you all may not have considered: every time an Atlantic Fleet aircraft carrier pulled out of Norfolk or Mayport requiring its Air Wing to embark, the poor VAQ bastards (electronic attack squadrons) had to fly their EA-6B Prowlers and their squadron all the way across the length of the United States and meet their particular ship. And us Florida-based squadrons bitched and moaned…constantly…about our comparatively very short trek off our coast to the ship. Since I had joined the Nimitz back in ’86, a month prior to her last Med deployment from the East Coast, I missed all the fun of the work-up cycle, which found a carrier and her squadrons going to sea very often. Sometimes, it lasted just a couple of weeks while at other times we’d be at sea for a month or two. The process of going back and forth made going to the boat a genuine pain-in-the-ass. Looking back, of course, I’d gladly haul cruise boxes up and down narrow ladders and through endless numbers of knee-knockers just for the chance to serve aboard today! Sometimes, the ship pulled out of Norfolk without us. Consider this brief, interesting at sea period described in the Roosevelt’s official Command History: Standardization and deceleration trials were conducted with David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center observers at HECTOR RANGE on 23 and 24 April. Resulting data determined maximum speed for CVN-71 and filled in tactical data for NIMITZ class carriers. Now that had to be fun! The TR underway during training. , USN As is the nature of an aircraft carrier’s flight deck, tragedy is just one distraction away, no matter how well the crew gels. On the morning of March 13th, we happily welcomed the arrival of a C-2 Greyhound COD. After she unloaded her mail and supplies and reloaded passengers who were leaving the boat, the E-2 squadron maintenance personnel started her up for taxiing to the cat where she would launch with the next cycle. I was in our ready room and for some reason my eyes were glued to the PLAT TV screen , which was filled with the COD getting in position for launch. Then, to my horror, a young VAW-124 plane captain…mesmerized…walked into one of the C-2’s spinning propellers. I just couldn’t understand what I just saw. I do not remember much more of that day except the haunting sound of the call for a FOD (foreign object debris) walk-down on the flight deck after TR lost her first crew member. Despite our tragic loss, we successfully completed a period of operations that had us learning how to work as an air wing again. The Roosevelt then sailed north out of the Caribbean and dropped anchor off of Fort Lauderdale, Florida on March 31st. Some of the aircraft and most of the CAG-8 personnel disembarked to make room for an oddly-timed Tiger Cruise that saw over 1,500 dependents join the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier. USN At the end of the following month, we once again joined the TR for ops off of Virginia, Jacksonville, and in the Caribbean to accommodate the Reactor Department’s major readiness inspection known as the ORSE (or Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination). This at-sea period lasted from the 23rd of May to the 28th of June. Once again, tragedy struck the flight deck. This time it was a member of my own squadron and a friend. William Berry, a young airman, was working to become an Aviation Electrician (AE), if memory serves. He was one of the most promising, gentle, professional, and kind individuals I had ever had the pleasure of meeting. Despite the admonishment to keep your head on a swivel on the flight deck to see what is going on all around you at all times, you can’t account for everything, including not seeing a Tomcat turning its two powerful engines toward you. Berry was lifted off his feet by an F-14 and blown over the side of the flight deck, falling 90 feet into the ocean, the surface of which acts as essentially concrete from such a high fall. Some said they witnessed him struggling, while others stated he didn’t move after impact. As the ship mustered for the man overboard, the plane guard helicopter searched and searched for him. Sadly, everyone quickly lost sight of him. An SH-3 with rescue swimmer aboard circa the late 1980s. , USN Once the ship-wide muster was complete—confirming he was the only soul missing—I went out onto the starboard aft sponson in what daylight remained…and stood there…willing my eyes to see him… just over there… His body was never recovered. It is a genuinely precious thing, when serving in the military and watching people die, to be forced to face the full weight of what it means to be human…particularly at that young age when you are certain you are not only infallible and indestructible, but also eternal. From Russia With Love An interesting at-sea period took place without us having to embark on the 7th of July, 1988. Again, the ship’s official Command History describes what was a truly historic event: The top Soviet military officer, First Minister of Defense and Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei F. Akhromeyev, and a dozen top-ranking Soviet military officers embarked. The Marshal’s visit was the first time a Soviet military leader had been aboard one of America’s sophisticated nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Guests of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe, the Soviets were given a tour of TR, from galley to the bridge. Ship operations were explained by TR crew members. On the flight deck they observed aircraft being launched and recovered and Carrier Air Wing EIGHT’S air power demonstration. First Minister of Defense and Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei F. Akhromeyev aboard the TR , S-3 Viking looming in the background. , USN via Kevin Noonan A month later, President Reagan was giving a speech for the 70th Annual National Convention of the American Legion and described what took place aboard TR during the Soviet visit. His words still give me the chills: “We took Marshal Akhromeyev to visit our newest supercarrier, USS Theodore Roosevelt . We thought it would be a valuable education for him. And so he saw that magnificent ship go through its paces. He watched our superb aircraft perform. All in all, he spent a day on one of the technological wonders of the world, a floating airfield his Navy had nothing to equal; and yet, you know what he said he was most impressed with when he was through with the visit? Our enlisted men and women. I was told that he couldn’t get over the fact that we had them doing work that the Soviets would reserve exclusively for officers, in many cases, very superior officers. And he couldn’t believe that our enlisted people were so self-assured in speaking up when asked a question, so articulate in giving their replies, and so ready to add their opinions.” It was a great time to be an American sailor and a great, great time to be an AW. Then, on August 25th, the USS Theodore Roosevelt joined up with her full battlegroup for the first time and set sail toward the North Atlantic on one of the most realistic exercises I had ever been on or would be a part of. Teamwork ’88 most closely resembled what we would do in a war with the Soviet Union. War In The Fjords As we prepared to engage in a wartime penetration of the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap on our way to the aircraft carrier bastions that were, and still are, the Norwegian fjords, we were joined by over 200 allied warships and auxiliaries and over 500 aircraft of all types. Some of those ships would form an amphibious strike force that would conduct a landing on the northern part of Norway on the 16th of September to practice repelling an anticipated Soviet invasion. German and Dutch warships would form a Task Group that would escort a resupply convoy sailing from England to Central Norway. From there, a Norwegian Task group would takeover escort duty and resupply allied warships and bases at Bodo and Narvik. The United States’ first supercarrier, the USS Forrestal (CV-59) would join the nation’s latest supercarrier in a simulated battle. A third flat top, the U.K. Royal Navy’s HMS Illustrious (R06), would meet us off Iceland as we ran the GIUK gauntlet. The Brits would act as overall anti-submarine warfare (ASW) commanders for both carrier battle groups (CVBG) and the amphibious group. To contrast a Cold War CVBG with today’s Carrier Strike Group (CSG), allow me to list my carrier’s battlegroup elements: USS South Carolina (CGN-37) our primary carrier escort USS Leyte Gulf (CG-55) air warfare commander and towed array ship USS Mahan (DDG-42) USS William V. Pratt (DDG-44) USS Moosbrugger (DD-980) our most excellent towed array ship USS Comte De Grasse (DD-974) USS Charles F. Adams (DDG-2) USS Conyngham (DDG-17) USS Moinester (FF-1097) our towed array frigate. USS Detroit (AOE-4) a “fast combat support ship” that was our one-stop-shop for fuel, weapons, snacks, and cigarettes. We also had two nuclear fast attack submarines (SSNs) escorting us: the USS Jack (SSN-605), an old Permit class boat that was still fighting strong, and possibly the very unique and super quiet USS Narwhal (SSN-671). Overall, more than 10 submarines would be participating in the exercise. Again, this was just my CVBG! The Forrestal had a similar composition of warships escorting her, as well. As we made our way up the North American east coast with the amphibious strike group, we were joined by a Canadian Task Force off of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Then, just south of Iceland, we were further reinforced by the primary NATO ASW Strike Force under command of the British on board the “Harrier-carrier” HMS Illustrious (R06). HMS Illustrious sailing alongside the TR during Teamwork ’88., Kevin Noonan Over the next few days, we fought an opposed penetration of the GIUK Gap, simulating NATO’s failure to anticipate Soviet preparation for a war. Ideally, our forces would already be in the Norwegian fjords before the deployment of the Red Banner Northern and Baltic Fleets….ideally. With the addition of some of our escorts with towed sonar arrays and the full Canadian task force, the NATO ASW Strike Force set about clearing the waters between Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe and Shetland Islands. The Ticonderoga class cruisers worked with our E-2s and Tomcats to defend against the various Soviet Naval Aviation threats that opposed us including: Tu-16 Badgers (primarily the G and J variants) simulated by various aircraft including EP-3s, EA-3Bs, EA-6As, NKC-135s, British Canberras, and the unique EC-24 – the DC-8 the USN modified for electronic countermeasure (ECM) training. Tu-95 Bears (primarily the D and F variants) simulated by EP-3s. Su-24 Fencers simulated by Norwegian F-16s and British Tornados and Buccaneers. Various anti-ship missiles primarily those fired by Badgers, Bears, from Nanuchka class missile boats, and from nuclear-guided missile submarines (SSGNs)— Charlie II s and the sole Papa class boat, during wartime. These missiles were simulated by Buccaneers and Canberras. It was quite the battle just to penetrate this famous group of choke points. The second phase of this evolution began on September 14th as we fought to enter Vestfjord. This was when we were joined by the USS Forrestal just coming from a six-month deployment in the Med. Now, even more assets were making their way from Europe to become a tremendous combined battle fleet. These were composed of NATO’s Standing Naval Force Atlantic and a German and Dutch Task Group that would add to our ASW Strike Force and escort actual convoys to reinforce the amphibious landings. An ominous shot of the TR and Forrestal battle groups sailing together during Teamwork ’88., USN The plan was to have our escorting SSNs creep into the fjord ahead of the CVBG and hunt any Soviet diesel submarines that would most assuredly be pre-positioned there. Also, the ASW Strike Force sent ships ahead to listen with their tails (towed sonar). Once the carrier was safely tucked into the fjord, mines were laid to seal us in and keep additional submarines out. VS-24 and yours truly launched on several missions to radar-flood the Fjord in order to either catch a diesel snorkeling or a nuke boat’s periscope, or to keep them down, making them mission-ineffective. Then the fun began. There were definitely multiple sub-surface contacts made, some real and many false. We launched on these repeatedly and I got my first hard dose of reality of just how difficult it would be to hunt a diesel submarine in wartime. Sub Hunt! On one particular mission we launched in support of an SH-3 sub-hunting helicopter from HS-9 that had gained intermittent contact on what appeared to be a CERTSUB—a submarine that has been positively identified. We dropped a couple of SSQ-62 DICASS (Directional Command Activated Sonobuoy System) sonobuoys and I began pinging. Holy shit! I didn’t know what the hell I was looking at. I had never seen a display or heard echoes like I was now encountering. This was not the Med and it certainly wasn’t anything that our systems trainer could reproduce. The uncanny environment that is the nature of the fjords simply unnerved me! But I kept trying and pinging. Finally, I got a very mushy contact. I called it. We dropped another DICASS closer and when it tuned up there was a solid ping. We told the world that we were in hot for an attack and I got one more, weaker ping and that was it. I never saw another return off of any of my buoys. Later evaluation would confirm that it was an enemy boat and we were credited with a kill. My mind was spinning. I really began to worry, for the first time, about my…about our ability to fight a Soviet diesel submarine in very real-world conditions. In the Med, we expected to go against the Echo II or Charlie II SSGNs and possibly the Juliett SSG, but the waters in the Med were much more conducive for what we do than what I saw in this disturbing echo chamber. The TR inside the fjords., Kevin Noonan My confidence would be shaken even more when, later, we went after a nuclear boat that had either been in Vestfjord lying in wait after the initial battles or had slipped past our minefields. The contact ranges were crazy-low one day and on the rare days when the water was a glass surface, we seemed to have ranges that went on forever. Among so many other realizations, it was clear that we weren’t preparing ourselves with detailed knowledge of how this body of water, and others like it all around the world, would play against or work for our sensors. The good news was the submarines were having the same acoustic propagation problems as we were. We spent several more days in the war against the “Soviets” flying many missions. Towards the end, the USS Forrestal joined us in Vestfjord—the first time, I believe, that two supercarriers had operated together in such an environment as part of a proof-of-concept showing that two full CVBGs could fight the ‘battle of the fjords.’ Surprise Viper Strike I’ve got to tell you about my favorite mission while tucked away in the Fjord—the one where I got ‘shot down.’ We were launching a full Alpha-Strike and, as usual, the E-2 and the S-3s were first to get shot off the pointy end of the carrier. I watched the E-2 run down CAT 1 (catapult one). Then it was our turn. As we went down CAT 2, I noticed a sudden flash go across the windscreen, about 500 yards off the bow. We got airborne and then another flash went by followed by flares popping out everywhere it seemed. At that point, we heard the Air Boss on guard frequency yelling at the attacking Norwegian F-16s (simulating Su-24 Fencers) to get the hell out of HIS air space, because they were endangering the launching aircraft! Well, two immediate things struck my mind. First, I didn’t get the chance to hear what laughter sounded like in Norwegian because none of the F-16 pilots responded and the attack ended as quickly as it started. But I’m sure there was plenty of laughter and joy because these great pilots left a flaming strike force on the deck of the mighty Theodore Roosevelt and my helpless S-3 got shot down, as well as the E-2 and another Viking that was launching off one of the waist catapults, in the process. A Norwegian F-16A carrying an AGM-119A Penguin anti-ship missile., USAF On the other hand, I participated in the laughter in my cockpit as we all realized just how pure the brass was on the pair of balls each of those Norwegian pilots had. We also realized just how serious the people of Norway were (and are) about training for war since they lived under the shadow and certainty of attack from the Soviets and the memory of WWII. Those pilots didn’t give a shit about the ‘Boss’s’ precious air space. They wanted to teach the United States Navy and NATO the reality of the old adage: You fight the way you train. My crew and I were convinced and I’d like to think that any protests that were offered to the Norwegians about this attack were presented with a knowing smile. What an amazing time it was up there, above the Arctic Circle, training for World War III during the final throws of the Cold War. The Crash After the intense ops in Vestfjord, the TR and her escorts made their way to Wilhelmshaven, Germany for a well-earned port call. The air wing was invited to participate in one of the legendary “fly past” airshows being held at RAF Abingdon in Oxfordshire, England. Feeling quite fortunate to have been picked for this event, I manned Scout 710 with pilot Lt. ‘JT,’ Co-pilot/Tactical Coordinator (COTA) Lt. ‘SM’ and because we were going to an unfamiliar airfield, an Aviation Electrician’s Mate, AE3 ‘JR’ was joining us. He sat in the Sensor Operator (SENSO) seat, while I took the Tactical Coordinator (TACCO) seat. We launched from the boat just as the TR entered the North Sea, an hour or so ahead of the other CAG-8 aircraft—one aircraft from each squadron, except one from our embarked helicopter squadron, HS-9. The combination of being worn out from the high-tempo ops and having to wear our drysuits made the flight seem longer than it actually was. Of course, I had to play with the radar and was awed by the on-rush of history as my APS-116 painted the English coastline. I was sharing the airspace that had been traversed by He-111s, Spitfires, Bf-109s, Ju-88s and Hurricanes during World War II. USN Once we were ‘feet dry’ (over land), I finally understood all the talk about the English countryside and its patchwork quilt of farmland and hedgerows. Even from the tiny TACCO’s window, it was an absolutely magical sight to behold. Our approach to RAF Abingdon was routine. However, as we entered the break running north to south over Runway 18, I distinctly heard the tower give us clearance to land calling the winds out of the west at “10 to 15 knots.” My pilot took note and discussed the direct crosswind with the COTAC as they went through the landing checklist amid the sound of deployed airbrakes, extending flaps, and lowering landing gear. Keep in mind, since the carrier tends to launch aircraft into the wind and recover them with the winds almost always straight down the angled deck, my pilot didn’t encounter many opportunities to perform a crosswind landing over the past month. So, as JT attempted to put three landing gear on the northern end of Runway 18, we were all very surprised to find ourselves over the rich green English grass growing along the left side of the runway. Instead of 10 to 15 knots, the direct crosswind was gusting up to 30 knots and was using our relatively large aircraft, that happens to have a particularly large tail, as a sail. JT fought to get us back over the asphalt-concrete mix, but our introduction to British windsurfing ate up nearly half of the runway. Realizing how far along we were, he called for the tailhook to be dropped by LT SM as all three wheels finally found the deck. However, the hook either skipped or came down too late to engage the single down-field emergency arresting wire. Once we had settled on the runway, I craned my upper body around the TACCO’s console—at least as much as my upper straps would allow—to see what the front-seaters were seeing. By doing so, I had thoughtlessly taken myself completely out of the ejection envelope. What I saw was a bit unnerving—a rapidly ending runway, a fast-approaching grassy field lined at the far end by one of those magical hedgerows, and a fence. Even more disturbing were the requisite British ‘aeroplane spotters’ standing along the fence line…and, ‘oh shit!’ a small van just went speeding across the windscreen from left to right along the narrow single-lane country road that ran along the southern edge of the airfield! And another… ‘OH, SHIT!…’ We weren’t stopping. Then, the COTAC said “Hold on, boys, we’re going for a ride!” Okay, so time slowed down in my mind to the speed required to ponder the various possible interpretations of what LT SM had just said. And then my mind started to race: ‘going for a ride?’ Van just flashed by—is there more traffic? Fence! People! Grass! All of this thankfully shocked me back into reality and time resumed normal speed. I immediately repositioned myself in the proper body position just in case the COTAC was reaching for his ejection handle. The last thing I saw out the aircraft windscreen as I pulled myself back into my seat was all the plane-spotters scattering left and right to get out of the way of the approaching U.S. Navy aircraft, loaded with four colonists, about to join them on their prime airplane-watching real estate. No ‘BOOM!’ of the ejection seat. No rocket motor firing, no rush up the rails and through the skin of the aircraft. Whew! Along with the thick English grass, my pilot’s thicker flight boots—which were pushing the top of his rudder pedals, slowed us down considerably. After a final jolt, we simply came to a stop on Barrow Road. Unfortunately, our fuselage, nose wheel, and left main mount were now blocking the flow of any Friday afternoon traffic. JT had wisely shut down the engines as we crossed onto the grass to keep from FODding one or both of them. I didn’t notice how quiet the cockpit was until the COTAC called to safe the ejection seats in a calm, professional, military manner. Once all four of us acknowledged “head-knockers down,” I made sure AE3 JR was okay and unstrapped myself in order to check the avionics tunnel for smoke or possible fire. More awareness came as I noticed that the aircraft had come to a stop at a slight right wing down attitude. In light of that final jolt, I wasn’t sure if the main gear had collapsed or the crew hatch might be blocked by the fence, the hedge, or the roadway itself. If so, we would most likely have to egress through one of the hatches above either the SENSO or TACCO seats. Again, thankfully, the hatch opened as it should and we all climbed out to inspect what damage had occurred just as the Abingdon crash trucks were arriving. To our collective surprise and my pilot’s relief, there was only minor damage. The main gear tires had excessive wear and the brakes were understandably smoking but had not yet caught fire. All the landing gear were down and locked and in excellent shape. Kevin Noonan It’s funny. Arrested landing after arrested landing aboard the carrier and I’d never given the landing gear’s durability a second thought. Now, after going four-wheeling across the English countryside, I was ready to kiss the hands of the Vought team who were wise enough to use the F-8 Crusader’s rugged main mounts and the A-7 Corsair II’s nose strut when Lockheed asked them to help with the design of their first carrier-based aircraft. We also inspected the engine fan blades discovering they had no damage and only a minor amount of paint was scraped off where the lower leading edge of the intakes made contact with the fence. Finally, a lookover of the radome revealed only a minor gash from where the fence attempted to resist this 20th century Viking onslaught. It was on this day that my respect and love for the Viking exceeded all prior indifference I might have had. We waited for a tractor to tow our aircraft back to the flight line and once she was hooked up, we began to walk to a van the RAF had sent to retrieve us and whisk us away to the base dispensary to perform the requisite post-mishap pee-in-a-bottle. All of the excitement made me forget that my tired body was still wrapped in a dry-suit. It would be good to get out of the damned thing. Kevin Noonan Overhead, a barely noticed Hawker Hunter had been making several low passes over the field. Now, we were all watching as she passed over our heads with her wheels down, about to land on Runway 36. A collective gasp could be heard from all of us as we witnessed the effect of another strong gust of wind and the vulnerable Hunter was pushed onto her side, her right wingtip nearly connecting with the ground. The pilot recovered admirably, flying off with full throttle and raised landing gear—as we all wished we had done. Someone wondered aloud if the tower had, once again, failed to warn of the gusty crosswinds. Just an hour or so later, after we had returned to our aircraft, I was inside the cockpit working with LT SM to get the auxiliary power unit (APU) started. We felt the earth move as if from an impact and then heard the explosion. We quickly stepped outside to witness a fireball rising into the sky just a few hundred yards away from where we were parked. A bad day for us had just gone tragic for Flight Lt Chris Lackman and Flight Lt Jack Thompson, the pilot and Weapon Systems Officer of an RAF F-4M Phantom FGR.2. I’ll let the narrative from Aviation-Safety.net explain what happened: On 23 September, 1988, [d]uring aerobatic practice at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, the aircraft performed a loop manoeuvre immediately following a 360-degree hard turn. The manoeuvre appeared slower than normal and the pilot was unable to recover from the loop. The aircraft struck the ground on the airfield tail first in a nose up attitude and exploded killing both crew. Also, I recently learned from this blog that Chris Lackman had transitioned from the Vulcan to the Phantom and flew as a co-pilot on the Black Buck operations during the Falklands War. The loss of any aircrew is tragic, but when you learn things like this about pilots and crew who had served in such significant historical events, well, it adds an unbearable weight to the story. Finally, one of my British hosts told me that Lackman and Thompson’s fellow aviators would come together at the Officer’s Club back at the Phantom’s home field and have a drink on the lost aircrew’s tab. The tab would then be closed out. RAF Phantom FRG2., Rob Schleiffert/wikicommons Over the next 10 days, a small team of our squadron techs and mechs who had flown over from Wilhelmshaven, along with our XO, checked the aircraft over completely, replacing all the tires and brakes. If memory serves, a strip of duct tape ensured that the gash in the radome would not affect aerodynamics. They also discovered that the seemingly fragile electronics had suffered no ill effects. This amazing team, who had been ordered to volunteer to give up their liberty in Germany, ensured that aircraft 710 was fully airworthy. Thankfully, they did get to enjoy the British nightlife after each day’s work on the bird. Oh, and they were happy about one unexpected benefit of their volunteering: they didn’t have to share Oxfordshire with 6,000 other American sailors. The Theodore Roosevelt pulled out of Wilhelmshaven and passed through the English Channel. With full and heavy hearts, we said farewell to our magnificent RAF hosts and manned aircraft 710. Our XO joined us in the cockpit after we discovered that AE3 JR had a ruptured eardrum from a cabin pressure dump we had experienced on the flight into Abingdon. Once airborne, we headed off the southern coast of England to return to our floating steel runway where the winds were almost always predictable. Trouble Shooting And then it was time for another Mediterranean deployment. This would be the final time the S-3A Viking flew over the Med with Air Wing Eight. Once we returned, we would begin our transition to the S-3B as our sister squadrons on the East Coast were doing. For now, we still had to deal with the limitations of the “A” at the end of the 1980s which meant the uncertainty of the computer working after a launch. Our software engineers at VX-1 were always working with the manufacturer to fix the problems we faced, but they never went away completely. As is the nature of the Fleet sailor, we created a work-around. I don’t recall which squadron initiated this plan, it might have been my Chief Aviation ASW Operator (AWC), he was brilliant like that, but we would now actively troubleshoot our system while airborne. We didn’t mess with the system prior to this because the electronics were expensive and the powers-that-be didn’t want a bunch of angry aviators messing with their stuff. However, our Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) and Chiefs argued to the point we were given the go-ahead to try and make the system work. The four stations in the S-3. The left rear is where the SENSO worked., Youtube Screencap Here are some of the things we did: just in case the Tape Transport Cartridge (TTC) wouldn’t load, or we had problems in flight, we sometimes brought a second one with us. If the OL-82A Acoustic Data Processor (ADPS) was giving us headaches, we learned to pull circuit breakers associated with specific elements of the system. Sometimes, a simple reset of the circuit breaker was all that was needed to fix the problem. If not, we’d pull them again and wait for the memory drums to slow to a complete stop. We would then pull the boxes from their connecting pins, inspect the rack and area behind the boxes to make sure nothing was out of place or broken, and reseat them…gently—they were very fragile and broke easy, particularly if an angry SENSO slammed the box back onto the pins. Nine times out of 10, this worked! We started doing this with any system that failed and the days of having a malfunction and having to orbit overhead the carrier were pretty much gone! Photo Bombing We entered the Mediterranean during the first of January just as we had on Nimitz two years before. This time, however, a Soviet escort wasn’t waiting for us. Perhaps this was a sign of the times. On the 15th January, 1989, we met the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) and transferred weapons. We then relieved the JFK and took on the mantle of Sixth Fleet Battle Force. We operated in the Western Med and then anchored off the island of Palma de Mallorca for our first of many port calls. Already, we noticed a huge difference between this cruise and the one on Nimitz . We averaged four to seven days in each port instead of the meager two to three days at the most in 1987. A major weapons transfer while the TR is underway. , USN Back at sea again, we joined the French aircraft carriers Foch and Clemenceau for Phinia ’89, a major amphibious exercise.  I’ll let the UPI news release tell the story: French, U.S. troops begin war games TOULON, France — French and American troops prepared to invade a Mediterranean island and evacuate its population during 10 days of war games that began Sunday off the coast of Corsica, military officials said. Three aircraft carriers and 14,000 French and American soldiers were participating in ‘Operation Phinia 89,’ the largest U.S.-French maneuvers since war games in the Persian Gulf in 1987 and 1988, French military officials said. U.S. Marines, French Navy commandos and rapid deployment forces planned a coastal invasion of the French-administered island of Corsica Monday to evacuate the population from a ‘hostile environment.’ The maneuvers, directed by a French naval command center in Toulon, were being carried out from the French aircraft carriers Clemenceau and Foch and the U.S. aircraft carrier Roosevelt using the French landing ships Ouragan and Orage, the U.S. amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal and U.S. amphibious transport vessel Austin. So, did any of you ever have to do that school science project where you drop an egg off the roof after having built what is hoped to be a durable container that will allow the egg to survive fully intact? We’ll come back to this in a moment. One of the things we learned from this exercise was how the Marines weren’t able to get relatively real-time reconnaissance photos of the battlefield they were fighting on. Remember, this was 1989. We needed to figure out a way to get Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) photos taken by the Tomcats, whether of a changing battlefield or Bomb Damage Assessment (BDA), developed and analyzed and then transmitted to the boots on the ground. F-14 with an intriguing loadout, including an electronic warfare pod and a TARPS pod. , USN Some of our genius NFOs worked with Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC) and came up with a styrofoam container and some other material (I don’t have a clear memory of it, just the event) that the photos could be stuffed in and we would launch it out of one or more of our sonobuoy chutes. They worked on it for a couple of months and ended up testing it during another exercise where the Marines were doing an amphibious landing. I was on that flight. We launched and headed to rendezvous with the Marines. Everyone was excited to see if this would work. We established comms with the ground Forward Air Controller (FAC) on the shoreline. The idea was to jettison the…well…egg…into the surf so the Marines wouldn’t have to go too far out and get it. We would also launch one over the sand to see if it would survive. The FAC cleared us in and we punched out two containers. We then flew away while they retrieved them. Then, we were called in for the beach drop. Apparently, they were having a hard time breaking into the containers because they were packaged so well. So, we said our “goodbyes” and headed out on our secondary mission. Upon returning to the boat, we all went into CVIC to find out what happened. As I recall, only one package survived the water landing (I think saltwater had penetrated the container and ruined the photos). The beach drop failed completely. I never did do that science project at school and I’m not sure if anyone involved in this project did either. The concept was a good one for that time because, as I said, there just wasn’t any way to get those much-needed photos to the Marines faster. However, our idea simply didn’t work. But you gotta hand it to the S-3—fulfilling its role as NAVAIR’s Swiss Army Knife, she answered the call to perform yet another uncanny mission. Rough Rest After the amphibious exercise, we pulled into Marseilles, France for another port call from the 10th to 17th of February. However, as was the case with winter in the Med, storms came along and made things interesting. I was sitting in the Ready Room when we heard the call to “set the special sea and anchor detail” over the 1MC (ship-wide address system). This was very unusual since we still had a couple of days left in port. I believe either the XO or Navigator of the TR then came on and said we were having to repeatedly “sail to the anchor.” A ‘mistral’ wind apparently caught us off guard and the CO of the boat decided it was too risky to attempt to stay at anchor. A mistral is a windstorm unique to that part of Europe, where winds are funneled from a high-pressure area off the northwestern and western coasts of France, down across the country through two river valleys, and out into the Med. This combines with a low-pressure area off the southern coast of France. The blow can sustain 60 knots and gust over 100. It can also last for up to a couple of weeks. Supercarrier anchored off France. , USN The order was given to do an emergency recall of all the ship’s company and members of the air wing still onshore. This was done in a very unique manner that we all were briefed about. I won’t go into exactly what it was because it still may be in use today. Unfortunately, not everyone could get back to the boat. We were in danger of grounding, so the Skipper went ahead and executed an emergency sortie. It was my understanding that many of the soon-to-be stranded sailors were already heading to the boat in ferries provided by France. What a sight that would have been to see your aircraft carrier leaving without you!  But two days later, we returned and picked up the rest of the crew. Hey, the commercial did say “it’s not just a job, it’s an adventure!” right? Sub Hunting From Sicily With our full complement of sailors, we headed back out to sea and transited the Straits of Messina. From there we headed to the waters off Libya since Gaddafi was rattling his saber. For this period, the commander of the Navy’s Sixth Fleet (COMSIXTHFLT) decided to join us, just in case. Apparently, Gaddafi lost interest and we headed off to Alexandria, Egypt for yet another port call! While there, the Egyptian Navy provided protection for our ships. For some reason, I had been asleep when we dropped anchor. Late in the day, I got up and went to the ready room because I was the night ASDO and was told by my fellow AWs that I had missed the Romeo class submarine that had sailed past us a couple of times along with some Osa II missile boats. I was pissed! Why the hell didn’t you wake me up?! The bastards! An AW not getting to see a submarine passing next to his aircraft carrier…!? After the visit to Egypt, we headed back into the Eastern Med and conducted flight ops. Just prior to our visit to Antalya, Turkey—a favorite of mine—one of our aircraft had a major incident. After leaving Turkey, it was my turn to head off to Naval Air Station Sigonella (“Sig”) in Sicily for a two-week detachment (DET). We took two aircraft to replace the ones that had been there already. It was simply a fantastic time getting to leave the ship and continue flying missions. This would be one of two DETs to Sig I got to go on. During this first one, I experienced the drastic difference between the VP (P-3 squadrons) and VS (S-3 squadrons) philosophy of how we flew our missions. CH-53 and CH-46s alongside a pair of S-3s at “Sig” circa the late 1980s., National Archives There was always a VP squadron at Sig. On a particular day, we and a P-3 crew were tasked to do a photo recon flight over the Soviet anchorage at Hammamet, just off the coast of Tunisia. The ASW Operations Center (ASWOC) at Sig wanted to know which Soviet warships were there, as well as if a missing Tango class diesel submarine might have turned up. Yes, a missing Tango . They started the briefing, giving us flight information and reminded us to stay out of unfriendly airspace. We received intel briefings on the ships expected to be at anchor and how the Tango had slipped into the Med through the Strait of Gibraltar and then disappeared. After the weather brief, the ASWOC crew told us that was it for us. The P-3 guys, on the other hand, would now be individually briefed in detail. We shrugged our shoulders, knowing that that was all we needed anyway, and headed out to our airplane. We launched out of Sigonella and immediately headed south across the Med to Tunisia. I was, of course, sweeping the whole area with radar checking to see just what we might encounter as we approached the anchorage. There was a single, large contact there and a few small ones. I dropped the FLIR in an attempt to identify everything before we ventured in to get some photos. It was just a Soviet auxiliary and small boats…no warships…damn!…and no Tango …double damn! Tango class Soviet submarine captured on the Mediterranean surface by a VF-143 F-14 TARPS camera., USN We took some photos of the vessels and then headed out to the western coastline of Sicily. My pilot wanted to do a low-level from west to east. On our way, we plotted all the shipping traffic and sent the surface plot to the ASWOC via Link 11. I used the FLIR to ID some of them, making sure none of them were combatants. We entered the low-level route and flew across the gorgeous Sicilian countryside. Just like England, it was breathtaking. At times, looking out my very small window, I had to look up to see the hilltop villages we flew beneath! After the run to Hammamet, the surface plot, and the low-level, we were done. So, we returned to NAS Sigonella, entered the break and landed. As we were taxiing up to our parking area, we all noticed that the P-3 crew we had briefed with were just finishing their engine start and had begun to taxi. We had launched, flew our mission, did a low-level, and landed in the time it took them to fully brief, pre-flight their aircraft, and start-up! I think it took almost two hours for our flight. Of course, they were going on a 10 to 12-hour mission, not only to check on the Soviet anchorage, but to provide a much more detailed surface plot for the ASWOC and Sixth Fleet. They would also be dropping and monitoring a sonobuoy search pattern in hopes of netting that Tango. A helluva lot more to do than we did. Still, it was such a contrast between our two communities and the way we flew our missions. Two weeks went by entirely too fast. We worked with the TR which was sailing all around the Med during my time in Sig. Let me list her gyrations for you: once again she had to tend to Gaddafi’s saber-rattling from 12-13 March. Then, she headed up to Naples, Italy for a five-day visit from 15-20 March. After that, she headed for Morocco and a rare two-day port visit. The central Med was calling and she proceeded to the fleet anchorage in Augusta Bay, just off the east coast of Sicily. For two days, the commander of Sixth Fleet hosted the Secretary of the Navy and our Mediterranean allies for a major naval conference on 29 and 30 March. Quite the itinerary for a Carrier Battle Group! She then weighed anchor and headed back to the Western Med where we flew out to rejoin her. We landed just in time for…another port visit! This time it was Toulon, France. The weather once again picked up as we left Toulon and things quickly went from bad to worse. As a result, we made headlines when HS-9 and our escorting cruiser, USS South Carolina (CGN-37), participated in a major rescue at sea. The official USN history of the carrier tells the story: A routine transit between port calls in Toulon and Monaco became drama on the high seas for USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT. Aircraft from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron NINE (HS-9), embarked with CVW-8, aided by TR and USS SOUTH CAROLINA (CGN-37), rescued fifteen British yachtsmen from four sailboats foundering in hurricane-like seas. The sailboats were part of a 16-boat flotilla sailing from Toulon to Corsica. Search and rescue swimmers from HS-9 entered the chilly water in waves estimated at 35 feet and winds clocked at 70 knots. One survivor, who suffered a broken leg, was airlifted to Toulon for treatment while the others walked ashore the following day when TR arrived in Monaco. The rescue was broadcast on television in France, Italy and the United Kingdom, and reported in newspapers around the world. I watched this drama unfold from the safety of the ready room, of course. We weren’t allowed to go on deck because of the 70 knot winds. It was stunning to see the aircrew and maintenance personnel fight just to get to the spots on the waist where their birds were tied down. The pilots masterfully got the engines and rotors started and lifted off to save those folks. Once on scene, the helo AWs then jumped into those 35-foot seas! Such amazing souls manning those helicopters. In my mind, no one will ever approach the greatness and heroics of a Rescue Swimmer. HS-9 Sea King alongside the TR ., USN After the relatively short port visit to offload our guests and enjoy an always beautiful and towering Monaco, we headed back to sea for Dragon Hammer ’89 which ran from 20 April to 02 May. The AW who flew in this year’s rendering of the major Med exercise was not the same AW who flew in it back in ’87 off Nimitz . I was a completely different person. It was during this event that the S-3 Viking was paid the highest compliment she could have received…from a submariner. The skipper of a Rubis class nuclear fast attack submarine (SSN) operating as an orange force (aggressor) boat sent out a message to COMSIXTHFLT expressing his deep frustration that every time he extended a mast, his ESM system (electronic support measures used for electronic intelligence gathering) picked up the S-3’s APS-116 radar. He said it made him extremely wary of being at periscope depth where he needed to be to get intel on the position of the ship. He congratulated VS-24 on our effectiveness at keeping him on edge and limiting his ability to target the carrier. Someone said his flare (to signify he had fired on us) was the prettiest shade of green… Rubis class submarine., French Navy After the exercise, we sailed to Haifa, Israel for another of my favorite ports of call. While we were there, members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were given tours of the carrier. I was on duty during one particular day and was delivering something somewhere on the ship when I entered a ladder well. Coming down the latter were several members of an Israeli Airborne unit. I stepped aside to allow them clear passage. As one of the officers turned toward me our eyes met. He smiled, appreciating that I had given him and his men room to maneuver in the tightness of the compartment. His smile and face were kind, but his eyes…his eyes were oceanic blue and had a depth to them that I had never seen in a pair of human eyes. A depth that told me stories of the life of a genuine warrior who had done things and seen things I could never comprehend. They were the coldest, deadliest eyes I had ever seen…I will never forget them. When we pulled out of Haifa, I was told I was going back to Sigonella for another two weeks. An Echo II submarine had entered the Med and the carrier was going to transit all the way back to the Balearic Sea, just off the coast of Spain, with the hope of allowing the CVBG escorts some “time on-top” of the Soviet submarine. We would be flying against the Echo II , as well. The boat was scheduled for a second visit to Palma de Mallorca, which was everyone’s favorite. I was not the slightest bit disappointed that I would miss it. After we arrived at Sigonella, I got only one opportunity to fly on the Soviet boat. We launched and headed out over the central Med. At least two of the Roosevelt’s escorts were holding contact on the Soviet guided missile submarine (SSGN). Years before, the USS Moinester (FF-1097), a Knox class frigate, had led the way in operational and tactical development of the towed array sonar system. She was one of our escorts and was joined by the Spruance class destroyer USS Moosbrugger (DD-980). “The Moose,” as we affectionately called her, was manned by the greatest anti-submarine warfare crew…ever! To give you an idea of the captain and crew’s outstanding personality, she had a rack of moose antlers mounted to the bridge superstructure! Unfortunately, (and with no disrespect intended to the Skipper and crew of the Echo II ), these two ASW warriors weren’t faced with a very challenging subsurface target. This Echo II class was a very noisy first-generation nuclear submarine, the last of which the Soviets commissioned in 1967. This crack ASW team deserved a Charlie II or an Oscar, at least. We were vectored in by the “Moose” and dropped buoys on the Russian sub. Instant contact! We ran her into an attack barrier and just as we were making our run, I noticed a significant change on her acoustic signature…something I hadn’t been trained for. It was nothing significant, but it reminded me that I still wasn’t the ASW expert I should have been and needed to be. She was coming to periscope depth to take a look at the newest hunter that had arrived to harass her. I felt sorry for the Skipper, knowing that every time he raised his periscope a NATO aircraft filled his impotent crosshairs. We made a low pass over her and we were joined by an SH-60B Sea Hawk from the Moosbrugger . It was our attack run, but we didn’t open the weapons bay doors. The crew of the submarine was humiliated enough and it probably would have created an international incident. Soviet Echo II submarine., RAF In what felt like 20 minutes, the four-hour flight had come to an end. The Echo II returned to her cruising depth, never finding the carrier. We checked out with the ASW commander on board the Moose and headed back to Sigonella. On our way back, I started to think about what had just happened. The Cold War was not over yet and, had this been a hot war engagement, I realized we would have dropped a torpedo or two to destroy that submarine. For the first time since I became an AW, I thought about the 100 or so sailors working, living and fighting inside that hull. It struck me that they were human beings, just like me and that I would have to be a part of the ending of their lives had this been a combat mission. I evaluated my feelings…could I do this? Could I be a part of killing so many souls during wartime? I understood…completely…that they were after my floating home with its 6,000 residents. They, too, would follow their orders and fire their missiles in an attempt to sink us. Before we entered the break over NAS Sigonella, I knew that I could kill these men if I had to. My time on-top made me see them as the humans and warrior-sailors they were and I respected them and the Soviet Navy more than I ever had because of that flight. One other thing about my second visit to Sigonella. On the evening of 06 June, I walked into the room of one of my NFO’s where world history was, once again, marking time. On his TV screen, a lone man was standing in front of a column of Chinese Type 59 tanks. The day-old news video showed the tank’s driver trying to move around him and this “Tank Man,” as he would later be known, kept moving in front of the armored vehicle. We marveled at the world that was changing for the good all around us. Little did we know… We said goodbye to NAS Sigonella and rejoined the TR . On 15 June we rendezvoused with the USS Coral Sea (CV-43), off-loaded our weapons and handed the mantle of Task Force 60 to her. The Coral Sea relieving the TR in the Mediterranean in June of 1989. , USN On 20 June 1989, we left the Mediterranean Sea. I would never again sail on these beautiful, emotional waters. A More Powerful Viking When we returned from my second Med cruise, our squadron was scheduled to transition to the “B” model of the S-3. We were all excited but we really weren’t prepared for the exponential change that was about to occur. As we were about to begin the transition, Sea Control Wing One, Atlantic, held its “Crew of the Quarter” competition. In those days, the competition was “flown” in the Training Command’s Weapon System Trainers (WST). This would be the last time a crew flying the “A” model of the Viking would compete. VS-27’s training building only had one WST left that had the S-3A avionics and simulator software. My squadron, having just begun the transition to the “B,” was chosen to fly against a couple of squadrons that were already flying the S-3B. Unlike the VP community, we didn’t have set crews, so they just picked four of us to go over and fly the competitive mission. For me and the other three, it was a very routine experience. And, we won ! In all honesty, this really didn’t mean much because we were so well versed in the “A,” and the other squadron’s crews were very new to the workings and manipulation of the “B’s” more advanced systems. The real story was just how different the S-3B’s acoustic system was. There was much more to do in preparation for the hunt and then critical things we needed to do to maintain contact. Simply put, the “B” crews we competed against were a bit overwhelmed. The S-3 Viking Weapon System Improvement Program (WSIP) was approved by the Chief of Naval Operations in 1977. Development began in 1981 and the first converted S-3A flew as a “B” on 13 September 1984. S-3B Viking art from Lockheed public affairs booklet., Lockheed The changes were significant: the APS-116 radar gave way to the APS-137 Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), which greatly improved its periscope detection capability and, most importantly, allowed us to ‘image’ a radar contact. LEFT: Starboard bow ISAR image of Knox class frigate. RIGHT: starboard bow ISAR image of a merchant ship. Superstructure is to the left of image with four king posts lining the deck as you move right., Texas Instruments/USN Our ALR-47 ESM system was replaced by the ALR-76, which according to Brad Elward in his book The S-3 Viking In Action : …provided greater frequency coverage and improved bearing accuracy within 2 degrees. The new ESM also gave Viking crews a basic missile threat warning, providing C-band through J-band coverage of both pulsed and continuous wave emissions. Combining these two sensors made us an incredible war-at-sea asset to the CVBG. It also contributed to keeping our happy asses safe because the missile warning component could automatically launch chaff and flares from the new ALE-39 dispensers placed on either side of the aft fuselage, just behind the main landing gear wheel wells—the primary visual cue for telling an S-3A apart from an S-3B. Our FLIR was updated and, of course, we could now launch AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles off of either wing hardpoint. We were also plumbed to carry the buddy store for refueling, as were the S-3As on the West Coast since they didn’t start getting the “B” until the early 1990s. We also got a new, more powerful APU for independent engine start and powering the aircraft for maintenance. Finally, and what mattered most, was our new IBM UYS-1 Proteus Spectrum Analyzer Unit (SAU) that replaced the OL-82A Acoustic Data Processing System (ADPS). We were now on par with the P-3C Orion Update III and ready for the trend in Soviet submarine quieting efforts born out in the Victor III , Akula , and Sierra classes of SSNs, the Oscar SSGN, and had the Cold War not ended, the very latest Yasen class SSGN . We also received the capability to monitor 99 radio frequency channels instead of just 31, which expanded our ability to deploy far more sonobuoys without interference between them. And even though our General Purpose Digital Computer (GPDC) looked the same on the outside, thankfully, it was a completely new computer that could handle so much more processing. And that troublesome TTC? Well, it changed as well. I never had a single problem with the system loading and staying loaded when we were flying off the boat. S-3B Packing a like AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. , USN On the outside, the aircraft looked exactly the same with only subtle differences that you had to know to look for. Elward describes just how brilliant Lockheed and the software companies were in making this immense change work with little impact on the jet’s performance: Overall, the WSIP modifications added a mere 601 pounds to the Viking, changing its characteristics only slightly and maintaining the aircraft’s center of gravity within existing limits. Power consumption for the new equipment increased less than 1KW. Brilliant, indeed! As we progressed through the classroom training during VS-24’s transition to the “B,” I was in awe of what our new radar and acoustics could do. As with my training in LOFAR , understanding the ISAR imaging we were seeing was, once again, just like learning how to speak a new language. Initially, I couldn’t see a damn thing except the very obvious Knox class frigate and the box-like geometry of merchant ships. When trying to decipher all the other images from other warships, I felt certain that Texas Instruments (the creator of the APS-137) had hired Hermann Rorschach as a consultant. The genuine tragedy in all of this? I would never get to take this new weapon system out and fly on top of a Soviet submarine in the Med or the North Atlantic. While I would get to operate the system against USN submarines, drastic winds of change were blowing in 1989 and throughout the early 1990s that would revolutionize everything… …forever. The B is for Brilliant Once we completed the transition to the S-3B, our time on the boat was never the same. We were suddenly the stars of the Air Wing. Everyone wanted our autograph! Our Vikings were constantly asked to do more and more. Along with the obvious need to refuel CAG-8 aircraft, we were invited to join war-at-sea strikes against surface action groups (SAGs) by providing radar plotting and identification of the targets. Our ESM was recognized as a superior asset for at-sea and overland strikes and instead of just a couple of E-2s or EA-6Bs, the Carrier Air Group Commander now had 10 airframes he could distribute across the wide spectrum for his electronic surveillance needs. Oh, and we still did ASW, too! USN As was the case in 1988, we joined the Theodore Roosevelt frequently for various work-ups that would prepare the air wing for her next major deployment in 1991. We spent much of that time down in the Caribbean participating in a wide range of exercises. I was reaching my peak as an ASW operator and the tools provided by the “B” only made my ability to search, detect, localize, and track a submarine that much better. On one mission, in particular—one of my all-time favorites—I was stunned to have made contact on three different submarines in the same search pattern. Two were “orange force” aggressor boats playing the bad guys and one was hunting the other two! A few days later on another of my most memorable flights, my crew was returning to the carrier’s overhead stack in preparation for recovery after an anti-surface warfare (ASuW) mission against a surface action group. We were early and I decided to tune up an old defensive search pattern that had been seeded on the flank of the carrier hours before by a P-3 and S-3. Apparently, no one else was monitoring it. Earlier in the day, an orange force boat had been ‘sunk’ by an S-3 Viking and an SH-3 Sea King and exercise rules required a sunken submarine to “reset” for a certain number of hours and relocate before coming back into play. Having tuned the buoys up, we started having problems with a particular black box that was unrelated to the ASW system and after safeing our ejection seats, I got up and went into the avionics tunnel to troubleshoot. As I’m working, I glance back at my display. Lo and behold, a submarine signature started to build very close to one of the tuned buoys. I don’t recall its distance from the carrier, but it was about to arrive within torpedo range. While still in the back of the aircraft fiddling around, I called “subsurface contact” on the buoy. I reseated the black box and climbed back into my seat and informed the TACCO of the unique classification of this particular target. USN The carrier’s anti-submarine warfare coordination center acknowledged and vectored a newly launched and already-tasked S-3 to the contact. Since we were low on fuel and the mission tanker was topping off the tanks of a strike that had just launched, we were told to land. When I made my way to the aforementioned operations coordination center to deliver my analog tape recorder of the mission, the guys informed me that the submarine was the one that had been killed earlier. The skipper was “breaking the rules” by coming back into the game sooner than he was supposed to! This is one of the amazing qualities that submariners are known for…just like those crazy-good Norwegians F-16 pilots, they are notorious for administering a strong dose of reality to a generally unrealistic naval exercise. Viking Quarterback It was also during this time at sea that we had the chance to show just how valuable we were to the CVBG with our shiny new S-3Bs. This time it was in the use of our incredible APS-137 ISAR in support of an alpha-strike against a ‘Soviet’ surface action group. The group was composed of four US warships simulating various units of the Russian Navy. A Spruance class destroyer was simulating a Slava class cruiser, an Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) class frigate was simulating a Sovremenny class destroyer, another OHP was simulating a Kashin class destroyer, and a Knox class frigate simulated a Krivak class frigate. Both the surface action group and my carrier battle group were under EMCON (restricted radio frequency emissions control) conditions. We set out to search for the task force before they could target us. To have to face a salvo of the Slava’s sixteen SS-N-12 Sandbox missiles, each with a range of 300 miles at Mach 2.5, was not something any of us had a stomach for. An E-2 that was already airborne had gotten some over-the-horizon ‘sniffs’ from an SH-60B Seahawk’s radar—the Seahawk would be simulating the Soviet Ka-25 Hormone or Ka-27 Helix helicopter which could provide mid-course guidance for their deadly anti-ship missiles. Based on the E-2’s bearings, we flew to a certain offset point before we turned on our radar. As I expanded my search, I gained contact on several curious forms that appeared to be sailing together in a loose formation. I switched to ISAR and painted each one. The first two were merchant ships. The next four were…the enemy! There were other contacts around, so it was clear that the SAG was trying to hide among the “lilies of the field.” They were just about 180 miles from the carrier. USN The carrier launched an alpha strike composed of A-6Es loaded with Harpoons, an EA-6B to electronically protect the strike, and some Hornets that were armed for an immediate follow-up strike. Of course, we had our Tomcat combat air patrol already airborne ready to use its Phoenix missiles should the Slava get her needed targeting data. We were well off the strike aircraft’s axis so we, too, were going to fire our simulated ‘Poons to give the surface action group something to think about. I looked at each warship and identified the class. We then sent the data over Link 11 to allow the strike leader to determine the best approach for the Harpoon launch. They were impressed that we could ID, precisely, which contact was which. The strike leader called for the launch of all weapons and we simulated the simultaneous release of our two missiles—had this been real, we would have only launched one since we had a buddy store on the left wing. Then, one of the A-6E Intruders broke away from the formation, simulating the flock of Harpoons, and flew out to greet the enemy flotilla. A-6E and other elements of a strike package. , USN A few hours later, after we had all recovered back at the ship for the day, the CO of VA-36—the Intruder Squadron—came into our ready room wanting to speak to our skipper. His face had a very big smile on it. Not knowing he was the one leading the strike, I listened with deep satisfaction as he described his approach to the surface action group. He simply couldn’t believe it! Just as we had told him, he came upon each of the warships sailing in the exact formation we had plotted with the exact ship classifications a conveyed…despite the fact that none of us had seen them with the naked eye. “Fucking magic!” was the phrase he used, if I recall correctly. I think he subsequently demanded a flight with us just so he could see the wizardry himself! It was on that day that the barely tolerated and often maligned S-3 Viking finally achieved her much deserved status as an integral part of Air Wing Eight’s strike capability. Fucking magic indeed! The Student Has Become The Master During the final four years I was in the Navy, I was an S-3B SENSO Instructor teaching newly minted Naval Aircrewmen and old salts who were transitioning from P-3s or helos how to operate the system and fly safely in the Viking. This track took me back to Millington, Tennessee where I got to slay yet another one of my personal dragons at Basic Instructor School. Ever since middle school, I refused to stand in front of a class or a group and commit the violent act of public speaking. However, on our first terrifying day at the Navy’s school…yep…I had to join my diverse class of petty officers and chiefs and stand in front of them offering a detailed resume about myself. I shook, stuttered and almost vomited my way through it. But then something remarkable happened. After I sat down, something literally changed my life. A very seasoned, stereotypical chief with an impressive set of ribbons adorning his khaki chest, stood at the head of the class and…shook, stuttered, and almost vomited while introducing himself. I was stunned! To see a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer suffering just like me was such a powerful awakening. Over the next four weeks, to varying degrees, my shipmates and I overcame this fear and I fell deeply in love with idea and the practice of teaching. My time as a SENSO instructor was rewarding professionally. I was very good in the classroom and very passionate about conveying what I knew and had experienced in the Viking and the aircraft carrier environment. I did particularly well because I taught subject-matter I was an expert in and my students wanted to be there. However, I discovered character flaws that I wasn’t at all pleased with that shore duty seemed to amplify. I did some very dumbass things because…well…I was a dumbass. I wasn’t alone in this discovery. What I realize, now, is how valuable a mentor would have been to me during my first four years on sea duty. I needed a mature, guiding hand to befriend and critique my very narrow view of the world and even narrower view of myself. I desperately needed someone to kick my dumbass-ness with great force and regularity. Unfortunately, my religious upbringing and inherent personality kept some incredible fellow AWs…particularly my AW chief…at arm’s length due to an unhealthy, self-righteous arrogance. This is where having grown up a loner was of the greatest detriment to me. Sailing Off Into The Sunset During my 10 years in the US Navy, I accumulated 1,515 hours primarily in the S-3A/B and 222 traps, all but one in the Viking. I then made the very worst decision of my life and walked away from it all. Prior to that fateful decision, in some ways, I could see the writing on the wall for my amazing airplane and decided to take orders to become a Sensor 3 (non-acoustic sensors) on P-3Cs based out of Hawaii. I wanted to see the rest of the world and satiate my deep affection for Asia and all the wonders it had to offer. My work with the APS-137 and ISAR seemed to indicate that my best years lie ahead working with radar and I needed a change of pace. However, the Navy, with its tendency toward myopia, decided to offer AWs an exit bonus in light of the end of the Cold War and the ‘end’ of any real submarine threat. As I read that BuPers message, a sudden wave of stupid came over me and I decided to get out. So, 10 years to the day, I left the United States Navy. Kevin next to his beloved S-3. , Kevin Noonan There have been innumerable consequences originating from that terrible decision to leave the Navy before I completed 20 years that have followed me to this day. Most importantly, I simply have never been able to adjust to civilian life. It has been an immense struggle to live in a world that is bereft of a strong work ethic, genuine leadership, genuine camaraderie, and a sense of purpose and honor. I am at a complete loss with those I encounter, daily, who refuse to simply do their job and “leaders” who refuse to hold themselves and their employees accountable to human excellence. The military was, and is, far from perfect, but it offers the tools and possibilities for every sailor, Marine, soldier, airman, and Coast Guardsmen to excel at being the very best human being he or she can be. You just have to take hold of those tools and possibilities. In the fourth and final installment in our Confessions Of An Ancient Sub Hunter series, we have a lively question and answer session with Kevin Noonan about all things S-3, ASW, and the Navy. It is a very in-depth and enlightening finale you can’t miss. You can read Part IV here.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the fascinating first installment in our exclusive multi-part series, Kevin Noonan recounted the unique path he took to learning how to hunt down Soviet submarines in an S-3 Viking during the final years of the Cold War. Now, in part two, Noonan tells us how the shadowy art of anti-submarine warfare is executed, why the S-3 Viking was so good at it, and takes us along on his first cruise, venturing into the Mediterranean aboard the USS Nimitz as tensions with the Soviet Union remained thick. So strap into your ejection seat and fire-up the Viking’s sensor suite as we launch off the deck of the Nimitz to play an incredibly high-stakes game of cat and mouse above and below the waves. The Many Missions Of The Marvelous Viking The Grumman S-2 Tracker had served the USN admirably since 1954, but naval technology had changed significantly during that time and it just couldn’t keep up. The introduction of nuclear propulsion for submarines changed their combat capability and performance and transformed ASW acoustics. The S-2 was designed to track diesel submarines and her airframe just couldn’t adapt to the necessity of new technology. The Navy was also deeply affected by the budget drain brought on by combat operations in Vietnam. Getting rid of excess expenditures was necessary and an entire class of ASW aircraft carriers, the Essex boats, which were home to the anti-submarine, or “VS,” squadrons flying the S-2, were seen as an unneeded fiscal burden. The USN decided to bring ASW (anti-submarine warfare) to the supercarriers, particularly the Nimitz class boats, the newest addition to the carrier fleet. So, the S-2s need for Avgas, requiring extra fuel storage separate from jet fuel, and its overall obsolescence forced the Navy’s hand. Thus, in 1966, a call was sent out to the aviation industry to bring carrier-based ASW into the latter half of the 20th Century. Lockheed answered with the S-3A Viking. She would not only perform the roles expected of the Tracker, but excel at so many more during her lifetime. A VS-37 S-2 Tracker breaks formation with her replacement, a VS-21 S-3A Viking, signifying the end of an era., USN While the S-2 was the first U.S. naval aircraft designed from the drawing board to be a submarine hunter and killer in one fuselage, the S-3 was the first carrier-based jet designed to perform that mission with all its hunt and kill computerized. Univac joined Lockheed’s effort, providing the AN/AYK-10 General Purpose Digital Computer (GPDC) that coordinated input from all of the Viking’s sensors. Texas Instruments contributed the AN/APS-116 radar, the AN/ASQ-81 MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) system, and the AN/OR-89 FLIR (forward-looking infrared) systems that made the Viking state-of-the-art in non-acoustic detection of submarines. Finally, IBM also contributed to her non-acoustic detection prowess by creating the groundbreaking AN/ALR-47 ESM (electronic support measures) system. What was so fascinating about all of these systems is how the GPDC, a computer produced in the late 1960s, could take input from them and create displays for all four of the Viking’s crew to perform the various roles assigned. Once the sensors had detected a specific threat, the computer could take input from aircraft avionics and move the airplane to intercept the target, automatically releasing its weapons. In other words, with input from all crew stations, the TACCO (Tactical Coordinator) could “fly” the plane from the backseat using fly-to-points (FTPs) and sensor/weapons select choices. As the aircraft symbol—or “bug” as we called it—captured the tasking symbology, the computer would send electrons to those particular parts of the aircraft and perform the assigned function. Pretty damn cool for an aircraft designed in the late ‘60s. Of course, the S-3A was not limited to ASW. Her radar allowed her crew (and the rest of the battle group via secure Data Link 11), to create an accurate surface plot. We called these missions Surface Surveillance & Control (SSC). Her FLIR, if needed, both day and night, allowed for visual confirmation of the surface contacts at stand-off ranges. The “A” model did not carry the AGM-84 Harpoon missile so our weapons delivery was limited to a warship that didn’t pose a significant Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) threat. Of course, if the balloon went up and, say, a Soviet Kashin class destroyer or Kresta I class cruiser was posing a threat that other Air Wing or escort assets couldn’t attend to, then our bombs were as good as anyone else’s, and we were…expendable. Additionally, the S-3’s extremely sensitive ESM system was used by Air Wing strike missions to detect coastal air defense early warning radars and SAM/AAA (surface to air missile/anti-aircraft artillery) sites allowing the attack aircraft to thread their way through to a target. The four stations in the S-3. The left rear is where the SENSO worked. , Youtube Screencap Another critical mission that suited the Viking well was on-scene commander, primarily during SAR (search and rescue) missions. Her long loiter-time, enhanced by her ability to refuel while in flight, allowed her to stay overhead a sinking ship or downed aircraft for well over six hours if necessary. With her sonobuoys and smoke markers (if carried), a life raft or survivor’s position could be “marked.” There were several advantages of dropping a “long-life” sonobuoy (up to 8 hours of transmission time) near a person or craft in distress, it allowed the Viking crew to mark the position and transmit that symbol via Link 11 to the entire CVBG (carrier battle group) or other naval ships and aircraft involved in the rescue. The buoy could be tuned up by another maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), including those from foreign navies, allowing them to mark-on-top of the buoy if the S-3 had to return to the boat and another was not available. Finally, the buoy would be subjected to the same wave and current action the survivors had to endure, ensuring that their drift could be managed until actual rescue assets arrived. The S-3 performed other missions, as well.  Prior to advancements and proliferation of communications via satellite, the Viking could mount a communications pod on a wing hardpoint and relay fleet communications efficiently and accurately over the horizon (OTH). Also, the A model of the Viking was utilized for various logistics missions and VIP passenger transport, but to a far lesser extent than the SH-3 Sea King, her rotary-wing contemporary. Although the S-3A had a weapons loadout similar to the S-2 Tracker, she had a capacity for growth not available to her radial-engine predecessor. With the submarine in mind, the Viking could carry a mixture of torpedoes, iron bombs, and rockets. By the time I started flying, she carried a standard loadout of up to four Mk 46 lightweight ASW torpedoes in the weapons bay (unlike the Tracker, we couldn’t carry torpedoes on our wing hardpoints). Also, in the weapons bay, we could carry bombs. However, the wing hardpoints were the primary weapon station for six 500-pound Mk 82 bombs or six Mk 20 Rockeye cluster bombs on a pair of Triple Ejector Racks (TER), two 1000-pound Mk 83 iron bombs, or 5-inch Zuni rocket pods. S-3 unleashing rockets., USN Torpedoes are the obvious weapon when going against the submarine. Less obvious, in a maritime world dominated by the nuclear submarine, is the need to attack one on the surface, something the Mk 46 was not permitted to do in order to protect any friendly surface ships in the drop area. One of the most important and neglected missions conducted by NAVAIR was aerial mining. The S-3 was designed with mining in mind. She could carry all of the Quickstrike or Destructor varieties of the 500 lbs, 1000 lbs, or 2000 lbs Mk-80 series on the wing hardpoints or in the weapons bay. She could also carry the much larger Mk 55 and Mk 56 moored mines or the ASW Mk 60 CAPTOR mines underneath her wings. The USN approached the not-so-sexy art of mining halfheartedly and we tended to mirror that feeling by practicing this critical form of warfare with great inconsistency. Searching my memory, there is only one time that I participated in an aerial mining exercise. S-3 carrying one of the big Mk 55 mines. , USN Two significant mid-to-late Cold War Soviet threats to the aircraft carrier were the Soviet nuclear-powered Echo II class and the diesel-electric Juliett class of cruise missile-firing submarines (SSGN and SSG respectively). Both of these classes had to surface to launch. To meet this very real danger, Viking crews regularly practiced bomb delivery. Finally, other things the Viking would carry were the always-indispensable external fuel tanks, one of which we always carried on the left and right-wing hardpoints when flying off the carrier. Also, when we flew from our home base to join the boat, one aircraft flew with a CNU-264/A blivet packed full of maintenance gear for our time at sea. A VS-24 S-3 carrying the dreaded CNU-264/A blivet., USN During the crew brief just prior to the squadron launching to go meet the boat, a notorious moan would issue from the mouth of that poor pilot who discovered he was scheduled to fly the “blivet bird.” I’ll never confess to knowing much about all “that pilot shit,” but it is quite obvious that flying with the blivet hanging off the right hardpoint was the proverbial “sore thumb” for regular aerodynamics, not to mention approaching the carrier for a trap. Speaking of sore thumbs, I would imagine that the trim button on the control stick and the pilot’s thumb got one hell of a workout. The blivet could also be used for an emergency logistics flight to the beach anywhere in the world we currently sailed if the CVBG needed something that wouldn’t fit in our avionics tunnel and a COD (carrier onboard delivery) just wasn’t available. Oh, and despite the hard-to-contain joy that issued from every aircrewman’s heart and soul when we briefed for the big fly-off from the boat going back to the beach, the ready room was filled with the requisite moan when that poor pilot once again discovered he was scheduled to fly the dreaded blivet bird. How To Hunt A Submarine From The Sky During the first 15 years of the Cold War, when the diesel submarine dominated the world’s oceans, several destroyers would work with air assets to exploit a Soviet boat’s greatest weakness if it came too close to a CVBG. Using their hull-mounted active sonar, the surface ships would make run after run over the top the target, especially if it appeared that it was coming to periscope depth. If it did get a chance to put its snorkel up, the destroyers would charge the submarine in a game of chicken, forcing the submarine to go deep. TBFs, AF Guardians, and S-2 Trackers would buzz an exposed periscope or, if contact was lost, work with passive buoys to regenerate contact. The S-2, with newly developed active sonobuoys, would harass the Soviets with constant pinging. The goal was to keep the submarine down to the point of battery and/or air exhaustion, forcing him to surface. Sometimes, in rare cases, practice depth charges would be used to remind the wayward boat what it meant to “rule the seas.” During these concerted efforts, sometimes lasting for a day or two, the aircraft carrier and the remaining escorts would escape by putting miles between them and the Soviet threat. With the arrival of the nuclear submarine, the CVBG’s status as ruler of the sea wasn’t simply diminished, it was abdicated to this truly undersea warship. The nuclear submarine can’t be forced to stay down until it exhausts its air and power. Its supply of those, technically, is unlimited. All its skipper has to do is effectively manipulate the oceanic environment and the effectiveness of those hunting him by either quietly slipping away or going balls-to-the-wall and outrun everything the CVBG could throw at him. Allied Navies, after having experienced the USS Nautilus during one of its first exercises against a carrier and her escorts, realized that control of the sea had suddenly shifted. The first nuclear-powered submarine raced noisily under a carrier’s destroyer screen and made mincemeat of the carrier. She then began to sink the screen from within. After having embarrassed the concept of US Navy ASW superiority, the Nautilus then added insult to injury by happily racing away beyond the reach of what remained of the battlegroup.  Still utilizing World War II weapons, sensors and tactics fit for a slow, predictable diesel, senior naval leadership throughout NATO realized that this revolution in submarine propulsion required a revolution in every level of anti-submarine warfare. The sensors, the weapons, the tactics and the platforms delivering them all had to change. YS-3A Viking prototype circa 1972., USN From the first pencil mark on the Lockheed engineer’s drafting table, the S-3 Viking was created to hunt a nuclear-powered submarine. Its large nose housed the egg-shaped APS-116 radar antenna that could rotate at 300rpm allowing detection of a periscope at considerable distances, even in heavy seas. Its generous canopy provided the pilot and COTAC (Co-Tactical Coordinator) with a commanding view of the ocean below, greatly increasing the odds of seeing a feather on the surface. Its high-set and broad wings provided remarkable lift and aerodynamics required to maintain contact on an evasive subsurface target. Its tall tail ensured rock-solid stability and endurance at altitudes best suited for weapons release, while avoiding the occasional flying fish. The S-3’s two remarkable, reliable, and extremely efficient engines could keep it aloft for MPA-like hours if necessary and ensure its safe return. It also had a relatively large fuselage disciplined by the designers to effectively contain the avionics, sensors, weapons, and crew needed to prevent a submarine from ruining an aircraft carrier’s day. And while most products produced for the military are designed for a current threat at the time an engineer sharpens their new pencil, the early 1970s Viking was built with room to grow in anticipation of the evolutionary progress of the Soviet submarine through the remainder of the 20th Century and into the 21st. At the time, anti-submarine warfare for naval aviation was divided into search, localization/classification, track, and attack. I’ll assume this process is the same today. I haven’t encountered any in-depth narrative about how ASW is performed by a P-8 Poseidon , particularly the high/low altitude method, and I’m exceedingly happy that there is very little open-source information available. The Viking’s ASW mission was of a tactical nature—keeping the carrier safe from the submarine’s cruise missiles and then torpedoes. Here’s how we did that in the team context of the CVBG: Any number of scenarios can present themselves to a battlegroup, but it is rare that we weren’t aware of the general undersea picture around us because of intelligence sources, primarily from the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). However, contact on a SOSUS array didn’t mean the submarine was localized, much less being closely tracked in many areas of the open waters in the Atlantic and certainly along the coastal boundaries of that ocean.  That is where MPAs, surface ships, and allied submarines came into play. Then, once a Soviet boat entered the Mediterranean, diligent tracking didn’t guarantee we would maintain constant contact. Thus, regenerating contact with battlegroup ships’ hull-mounted sonars and towed arrays (if they carried one) along with allied MPAs and the S-3s from the carrier, was an absolute priority. S-3A circa 1987., USN In the context of that need to regenerate contact, Allied air assets would lay large sonobuoy search patterns or the S-3s would lay relatively smaller search patterns if no other fixed-wing aircraft were available. If this was the case, then a second Viking might be sent out two to three hours later to maintain the current pattern by reseeding buoys that had malfunctioned or had come to the end of their life. The hope, of course, was that contact would be gained with the initial search pattern. Other strategies were to lay barriers of sonobuoys and position ASW ships along the path of the carrier as she approached and then penetrated the various choke points the Mediterranean offered. More specifically, depending upon the expected target—nuclear or diesel submarine—we would begin the hunt by flooding the area with our radar and investigate all contacts. This provided us with a “big-picture” of what was out there and ensured we didn’t drop buoys on unsuspecting surface ships at night or in bad weather. If a contact suddenly disappeared—known as a “radar sinker”—it would draw our attention all-the-more. This could be anything from a periscope, a passive detection antenna mast such as ESM, or a diesel boat’s snorkel as it attempted to recharge its batteries. It could also be a whale, schools of fish at the surface, trash, or even a sinking ship. If we are under EMCON (Emissions CONtrol—radio silence basically across much or all of the RF spectrum) within the battlegroup where none of the ships or aircraft are running their radars or radios, then we would launch and hold turning on our radar until we reached a certain distance from the carrier. One of the greatest advantages that the Viking introduced to the CVBG was our digital computer and sensor systems. We could turn the radar on for a few sweeps and then go emissions silent. As the antenna made its one or two sweeps, the SENSO (Sensor Operator) would quickly mark all returns on his screen and these would become permanent digital symbols displayed each of the crew’s screens. In the S-2, the screens were analog and the radar operator had to mark his screen with a grease pencil or on a plot board, keeping in mind the aircraft’s track, position, and compass bearing. In the S-3, the TACCO, who received all marked symbology placed on the screen by the SENSO, could then send that data via Link 11 to every receptive ship and aircraft in the CVBG. Meanwhile, the pilot would turn toward the targets of interest and “quietly” investigate. The S-2 operator, on the other hand, had to pass the data to the officer in the right front seat either verbally or on a plot board and have it communicated to the ASW commander via radio if not under EMCON and all the while relying on radios that might not always work as advertised. Other EMCON scenarios might have the S-3 vectored to contacts of interest by the E-2 Hawkeye or a surface ship well distanced from the carrier that is acting as the controller of the mission. By its very nature, EMCON invites targets to start looking for the battlegroup. Thus, when an enemy submarine or supporting warship radiates in an attempt to find the CVBG, the ships and aircraft can get lines of bearing to the source of the enemy emitters. For every type of contact generated from sources such as an ESM line of bearing or a datum, the S-3 Viking would lay specific sonobuoy patterns. As individual buoys hit the water and deployed their hydrophone, the SENSO would tune them up and begin to analyze what sounds the ocean was making around that particular sensor. One of the ideas behind a pattern of buoys was to space them in such a way where more than one buoy would gain contact. This helped to localize the position of the submarine to a specific area in the pattern.  From there, we might wait to determine the direction of movement of the target as other buoys gained contact and the bearings from directional buoys, such as the AN/SSQ-53 DIFAR (Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording), changed with the passage of the submarine. Once a course was established, we would run in and drop more buoys, at closer spacings, to refine our understanding of what the target was doing. The idea was to maintain a solid track that allowed us to catch any changes in course or depth. The other idea, in time of war, was to have enough tracking data refinement to drop a torpedo. While we preferred to use passive buoys to achieve this refinement, it was always nice to have additional confirmation of the submarine’s presence. Active sonobuoys could be used, but that wasn’t the best choice against a nuclear submarine. Magnetic Anomaly Detection, or MAD, was an excellent choice that allowed us to remain passive in the prosecution of the submarine. It was (and is) a very short range sensor that detected disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field made by a submarine’s own magnetic field. Usually, we’d have to fly very low against a submarine that was not very deep. S-3 with the MAD deployed., USN As opposed to the Orion, the Viking’s “stinger” MAD boom was retractable—at times it would get stuck in the extended position. Once we extended the MAD boom, I would have to “equalize” the ASQ-81 MAD head at the tip of the boom to help eliminate any field disturbance that came from our own aircraft. This is why most MAD booms are designed to be as far away from the aircraft as possible. Having a solid deflection of the MAD trace provided that warm-fuzzy feeling that confirmed we were doing a solid job of tracking the submarine. Of course, submarines have several means at their disposal to counter or weaken the non-acoustic detection ability of MAD such as degaussing equipment within the hull or going through the process of deperming, or reducing its own field prior to deployment. The longer the submarine is deployed, however, reduces the effect of deperming. The Soviet use of titanium alloys on the hulls of some of its submarines was also effective at reducing the overall magnetic signature. The S-3 regularly worked alone to search, detect, localize and track a submarine. We wanted to quickly find and keep a potential enemy as far away from the carrier as possible. However, gaining contact on a submarine and maintaining it was a far more successful endeavor when we worked as a team with all the ASW-capable assets of the battlegroup. Mark on top! An S-3 Viking and A-6 Intruder from the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) fly over a Soviet Foxtrot class diesel submarine. , USN One of the very best platforms to work with was a frigate or destroyer trailing its AN/SQR-19 towed array sonar. The sensitivity of that type of passive sonar and the professionalism of the Sonar Techs aboard those ships was humbling. Helicopters with dipping sonars were another team combination that encouraged a submarine to break off its plans. As a threat moved closer to the carrier, or we obtained contact in close, the carrier’s complement of SH-3 Sea Kings with the AN/AQS-13 dipping sonar would join in. If two helos were available, then even a nuclear-powered submarine would have difficulty getting to the carrier or getting away. The Soviet naval philosophy of submarine warfare rarely called for a submarine to attack a carrier on its own. From its birth, the subordinate Soviet Navy understood the concept of joint operations since it was primarily utilized to support the Soviet Army during World War II. While Admiral Sergey Gorshkov grew the Cold War Navy into a dangerous blue water fleet, he translated the lessons of mutual support he had learned from the Black Sea campaign against the Germans into tactics that incorporated all air, surface, and subsurface naval assets. The Viking was flexible enough to engage most of this effort in one way or another. If a cruise missile-firing submarine was relying on a Surface Action Group (SAG) of ships for targeting data for example, the S-3, while hunting the submarine, could also target and identify the accompanying group of surface combatants. The ability of one aircraft to carry a mixture of weapons such as torpedoes in the weapons bay and bombs or other ordnance on the wing hardpoints, invited the possibility of attacking both surface and subsurface targets. However, I would not have wanted to be in that airplane considering the excellent air defenses on all Soviet warships. Of course, you soon learn the concept of expendability when they explain the big picture to you about how all aircraft and their crews are expendable during wartime when an aircraft carrier’s survivability is at stake. Preferably, once a combined fleet strike has completed an attack against a SAG, we could also provide post-strike standoff bomb damage assessment (BDA) utilizing our FLIR. If necessary, we could then use our weapons to finish off a heavily damaged enemy vessel. The underbelly of the Viking is perforated with sonobuoy launcher holes., USN The historical record is not clear about how many Soviet submarines actually came within firing distance of carrier battlegroups during the expanse of the Cold War. I’ve personally only seen two periscope photos that claim to be taken from our enemy. And when one considers the nature and pride of Russia, I would think that the Internet would be flooded with many, many more if the genuinely professional and brave Soviet submarine commanders had experienced repeated success. We did our very best to contend with the complexities of ASW every time our wheels went into their wells on missions to keep the submarine away from our aircraft carriers. Unfortunately, if one were honest and able to evaluate all the data from 1946 to 1991, it would be clear that the ratio of green flares launched by a submarine going after a flat top to the number of non -reactionary, simulated torpedo or other ASW weapons’ drops was distressingly high. On A Viking Cruise Much like professional athletes who train for the big game, military units train for war.  But one of the unique things about serving aboard a warship or a deployed unit in the United States Navy is that the enemy you are planning to fight kindly offers his services to help you prepare for that war.  An aircraft carrier battlegroup’s deployment to the North Atlantic or the Mediterranean ensured a Soviet naval response and presence allowing both sides to potentially discover and learn how the other would act in time of war. On Dec. 30, 1986, after a break for Christmas, the USS Nimitz entered the Western Atlantic with her bow pointed east toward the Strait of Gibraltar and entrance into the Mediterranean Sea.  The squadrons of Carrier Air Group 8 (CAG-8, more commonly referred to as Carrier Air Wing Eight) which had been with the namesake of the Nimitz class of supercarrier since 1977, were already aboard having joined the carrier during the early days of December for the standard pre-deployment work-ups. The Nimitz flight deck and hangar bay was overflowing with a full complement of F-14 Tomcats from VF-84 Jolly Rogers and VF-41 Black Aces , A-7 Corsair II’s from VA-82 Marauders and VA-86 Sidewinders, A-6 Intruders from VA-35 Black Panthers , EA-6B Prowlers from VAQ-138 Yellow Jackets , E-2 Hawkeyes from VAW-124 Bear Aces , SH-3 Sea Kings from HS-9 Sea Griffins , and S-3A Vikings from VS-24 Scouts . USS Nimitz with CAG-8 in early 1980s highlighting incredible aircraft diversity.  Note the high visibility paint schemes., USN We made our way quickly across the Atlantic. I don’t recall ever “stopping” to do flight ops before we entered the Med. Having transited the Strait at night, the CVBG grew in strength by one warship. A destroyer of the Soviet Navy took station off the Nimitz ’ port side. Someone mentioned it in our ready room and I grabbed my camera for one of the painfully rare photos I took while I was in the Navy. There she was, a Kashin class destroyer with her two (of four) SS-N-2C Styx stern-facing missile launchers catching my eye. If the Cold War went hot in the next six months, she would turn and run away from us at a remarkable 35 knots and launch all four of these weapons, each of which carried a 1,000-pound high-explosive warhead. My first Soviet. The Nimitz picks up her tattle-tail destroyer, a Kashin class in the Western Med in January 1987. , Personal Photo The Soviets planned and trained for this scenario, something they called the “Battle of the First Salvo.” Hopefully, our Sea Sparrow launchers and 20mm CIWS (close-in weapon system) mounts would greet all four of her missiles before they arrived while our own genuine escorts sent the fleeing Kashin to the bottom. As this 20-year old kid stood there pondering the Soviet warship’s presence beneath a Western Mediterranean winter sky, the reality I had only read about suddenly became quite real. Chasing Charlie Before my 21st birthday, I would receive two stronger doses of that reality. The first came quickly. We had been attempting to relocate a Soviet Charlie II nuclear guided missile submarine (SSGN) that had been sent down from the Red Banner Northern Fleet and entered the Med to hunt the carrier we would eventually relieve, the USS John F. Kennedy , and now us.  While I had been flying since we passed by Gibraltar, this would be my first actual ASW mission. Did I hear that right? My first sub-hunting mission in the Mediterranean Sea would be to find a genuine Soviet submarine! I was scared S.H.I.T.L.E.S.S. We launched and headed to the southern edge of the Tyrrhenian Sea (one of the many seas within the Med) to relieve a P-3 Orion flying out of Sigonella, Sicily that had been monitoring and re-seeding a large search pattern of sonobuoys laid by previous P-3s. The pattern was designed as a flanking barrier to protect the Nimitz’s movement east and southeast toward the central Med just south of Sicily. Our mission was to monitor and re-seed the southern end of the pattern to replace dying buoys. Contact with the Soviet submarine had been lost a day or so before, at least by aviation and surface ASW hunters. We needed to regain it so we could keep the carrier from getting within the 40-mile range of the Charlie’s eight SS-N-9 Siren anti-ship cruise missiles. For four hours, we overflew each buoy in the pattern to update our plot and its geolocation to pass on Link 11 data link to the CVBG, the ASW Operations Center (ASWOC) at Sigonella, and the incoming P-3 that would relieve us. I tuned up sections of the pattern and I watched and listened. We reseeded specific buoys whose batteries died while we were out there. I watched. I listened. No contact. It was time to return to base. As we got vectors to the ship from the E-2, we climbed up to a decent cruising altitude and pointed our nose home. I continued to scan my tuned-up buoys, switching between acoustics and radar as I searched for the battle group to give the pilot an exact location of the boat. I switched back to acoustics and scanned. There… there ! Was it? It looked like a submarine. It wasn’t quite the exact signature I expected from a Charlie . I doubted. What should I do? Tell the TACCO? We’re almost out of fuel. The ASMOD (intel unit that coordinates ASW operations) aboard the carrier said the relief P-3 was having problems and wasn’t going to launch on time. My mind racing, I kept thinking to myself: “Was it the Charlie ? It looked like a submarine. I don’t want to make the wrong call. I can’t make a mistake during my first real-world ASW flight on an actual Soviet submarine. Is it a submarine? It looks like it but it only was a whisper, a very short contact.” I said nothing. I was terrified and the self-doubt was overwhelming. And then the guilt set in. My gut was screaming at me: “You know it is her!” But the doubt…the fear… Charlie II SSGN., USN We trapped aboard and the Nimitz resumed her transit eastward, just before she turned southeast to pass between Sicily and Tunisia. I unloaded my ATR (AN/ASH-27 Analog Tape Recorder glass reel that records all of our acoustic and other data for an entire mission) and carried it down one deck beneath the flight deck to the ASMOD.  I handed it the Nimitz ’s ship’s company AWs (aircrewmen) who analyzed all the tapes that we used to record our ASW flights. I was a very green AW and these guys knew it. I hesitated, then told them that I may have seen something on buoy such and such. “We’ll check it out.” They knew from my body language that I was worried. In the ready room, I tried to relax. Everyone noticed a sudden tremor underneath our feet as the carrier increased speed. It felt the same as when we crossed the Atlantic. I looked up from my chair and noticed that some AWs from the ASMOD were in the back of the ready room talking to my Chief. I sheepishly headed toward them. They had a large sheet of carbon-based paper in hand. On it, I noticed the same signature characteristics I had seen in the aircraft. My stomach sank and the blood rushed away from my face. “You were right, it was the Charlie. Just a couple of minutes of contact!” They left and I waited to be dragged by my flightsuit collar at the strong hand of my Chief behind the curtain that separated the ready room from our tiny squadron operations office. VS-22’s ready room aboard USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) circa 2003. , USN Although he rarely displayed it, I’d already seen his temper and was certain I would incur his wrath. I wasn’t really afraid of him, I just didn’t want to disappoint him because he was such a good leader. Crickets. Not a word from him. Not a word from my Division Officer. Not a word from my OPS boss. Not a word from the Skipper. The only response to my failure was the 100,000-ton aircraft carrier and her escorts making much more speed through the Strait of Sicily than originally intended. What really should have happened was that I had my ass reamed by all of the above. In fact, it would have been best if I had been dragged by my flightsuit collar out of the ready room, down the passageway to see CAG and the CO of the Nimitz . I think I might have been an even better sailor, an even better AW, and an even better human being had that happened. Instead, my self-doubt and second-guessing would continue and, in a few months, put me in a very similar position where I would finally get a clue as to just how much responsibility a single, kid-AW in a multi-million dollar aircraft had in the protection of well over 5,000 priceless lives and four and a half acres of a multi-billion dollar piece of sovereign United States territory. There was one very important takeaway from this experience: My gut was right and I would learn quickly that I had a sixth sense for finding submarines acoustically. Horror On The Deck Above The second dose of reality came tragically and violently on the night of January 25th as I watched from the warm safety of ready room four. The single EA-3B Whale from VQ-2, which had joined us as we entered the Med, was having major difficulty getting aboard. After missing the arresting wires five times, the Commander of the Air Group (CAG) ordered her to divert to Crete. However, she would need to refuel in order to do so. During her attempt to take on gas, she damaged the buddy store attached to the A-7 that was acting as tanker that night. Out of options, the CAG and the CO of the Nimitz decided against having the crew bailout and into the frigid waters the carrier was sailing through. Instead, she would take the barricade. After an inordinately long time rigging the barricade, the pilot and crew of six approached the carrier. It was clear, listening to the communications between the CAG Landing Signal Officer (LSO) and the navigator of the intel-gathering aircraft, that most all of her fuel had been burned waiting for the barricade. She was high, too high. The LSO screamed “Cut! CUT! CUT!” admonishing the pilot to cut power to the engines as the Whale crossed the fantail. Sadly, she just floated there. Her nosewheel struck the top of the barricade and the EA-3B hit the angle deck just above my ready room. I will never forget the sound as she scraped down the deck and off the angle, the fuselage splitting just forward of the wings. PLAT sequence of the loss of Ranger 12 aboard USS Nimitz, the EA-3B from VQ-2., portlyautey.com There was absolute silence in the ready room as all eyes were on the PLAT (Pilot Landing Aid Television) screen. The Nimitz ’ engines crashed back and we came to a stop with the aircraft’s aft fuselage and tail now jutting skyward off our port side. The plane guard helo hovered over it, her searchlight illuminating the wreckage and our hope that helmets would appear. We also listened as the helo pilot requested permission for his Rescue Swimmer to go into the water and enter the aircraft.  “NO!” was the answer.  After what seemed like an eternity, hope turned to horror as the tail slipped beneath the waves. I had never seen men die. Hijacked Hijinx On Jan. 27, 1987, Terry Waite, an envoy for the Church of England trying to obtain the release of hostages held in Lebanon, became a hostage of those he was attempting to negotiate with. Soon after, and in Sixth Fleet fashion, we were ordered to respond to this latest of eternal Middle East crises making our way to the Eastern Med. As we moved across the Mediterranean Sea, I began to hear of the place we were headed: BENO station. Like “Yankee Station,” where our aircraft carriers sailed and launched airstrikes against Vietnam, it was a place where the carriers would loiter off the ruined coast and countryside of Lebanon where civil war, which had been raging since I was in the 4th grade, continued. If necessary, it was the plot of sea from which we would launch strikes. Unlike, Yankee Station, it wasn’t an official USN name. BENO stood for: BE NO liberty, BE NO time off, BE NO fun, BE NO end. As we made our way there, our priorities shifted from fighting the Cold War to fighting the “War on Terror,” a conflict many don’t realize we were engaged in long before it arrived on our own shores on that fateful September day in 2001. In light of the common tactic used by terrorists in this region—namely hijacking airplanes—CAG-8 was tasked to train for a specific tactic designed to ensure the hijackers went where we wanted them to and VS-24 and I got to be a part of it! During the briefing, we were told only that our S-3 would act as the hijacked airliner and we were instructed to squawk a simulated international IFF code reflecting our hijacked state when we arrived over the portion of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea we were training in. It would be during the second half of a four-hour flight. During the first half we would conduct an SSC mission. S-3 launching off the waist catapult., USN We launched for what for me would be one of my most amazing flights. The first two hours were spent making a surface plot of the water surrounding the carrier, checking some of the shipping and performing a mission of mercy that I’ll describe below.  Then, at the appropriate time, we squawked our code, and soon, a gaggle of F-14s from both VF-84 and VF-41 were directed to intercept us by the E-2 (everyone in the Air Wing wanted in on this important training). I dropped the FLIR and rotated it as they approached and, for the first time in my life, I got to see these breathtaking beauties occupying the same airspace I was in! One Tomcat gracefully took station on each of our wings. Another two held station on opposite wings but off and behind their wingmen. Two more flew well aft of us. I could not believe that I was here at this moment in time! Unknown to my crew, our COTAC, Lieutenant D.R., had dressed the part having pulled a wash towel from the Officers Mess that perfectly resembled the headdress worn in that area. He took off his helmet, donned the cloth and from his helmet bag produced an Uzi water pistol! With Uzi in one hand, he held up a sign he had pre-written in a bold hand and plastered it against his right canopy glass so the Tomcat pilot and RIO—now tucked very closely off our right wingtip— could clearly read it. I don’t recall what D.R.  had written, but it was obviously something snarky and it garnered a response from the F-14 on our UHF radio: “Damn! You guys don’t have to take this thing so seriously.” All four of us were laughing. Per the scenario, we then dropped our landing gear as if we were on final approach to a regional airfield in a country that supported terrorists. The Tomcats moved away, but stayed just off our wings. My eyes were then drawn back to my FLIR screen as eight pinpoints of heat came up on our six very fast. They would quickly materialize into eight A-7s that passed quickly beneath us and the water, almost “thumping” us. And then…they all released their (practice) bombs!  Right down the simulated runway we were supposed to be landing on! USN The E-2 called an end to the exercise and gave everyone vectors back to the boat. God! To be a part of such things! A High Stakes Intervention High In The Sky Now, let me relate what happened at the front end of this flight, something that will stay with me until I die. I already said I got air sick during my first flight in an S-3 at VS-41. Well, the truth is, I had been throwing up on every flight since then. Thankfully, it wasn’t debilitating at this point and I could do my job; but it was so persistent that I decided to approach my Chief W. about it (who already knew—you built a reputation, particularly as a new crew member and the officers in the aircraft would let the Chief know). AWC expressed his concern saying that it could be a career-ender. I was a little overwhelmed by that statement and asked about the possibility of switching to P-3s (he had flown in P-3s prior to coming to the Viking), which I assumed would be a more stable platform. He proceeded to inform me that like the S-3, an Orion spent a lot of time at low altitude dropping buoys, among other things. This was a problem because the location of the Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 stations in the P-3 was right on top of the wing which meant that any turbulence the aircraft flew through would be transmitted from the wing to the two aircrew who were in a tunnel with no windows, their seats facing the left side of the aircraft. He made an additional, critical point: “Add to all of this, the smell of burning carbon-based paper that will permeate your station as you search, for hours and hours…” The P-3C Update III, with plasma screens that replaced paper grams, had just achieved IOC—Initial Operating Capability—the previous year. My mind was reeling as I was instantly transported back to the acrid smell in the trainer at NAS Willow Grove. At least in the Viking, I did have a small window, a limited view out the COTAC’s windscreen, and no burning paper. Were I to transition (back) to the P-3, I’d be puking multiple times each flight. I simply had no options. I had come so far. I had to stay in the S-3. Apparently, my pilot for that unique flight, Lieutenant Russ Bartlett, had been following my story. During my time at VS-24 I had so many outstanding pilots. But I will always hold Russ as my favorite and the very best. He was that rare person that showed zero arrogance in his ambition for career and life. I had never encountered such a well-rounded officer. He showed absolutely no stress and always smiled. He was genuinely friendly with everyone and, as I would discover, was an incredibly compassionate human being (believe it or not, he was a U.S. Naval Academy grad!). The Viking was a second skin for him. He had no problem being a “bus driver” and he was extremely well versed in ASW tactics. He always invested everything into the moment. The view out of the S-3 from the cockpit was absolutely amazing., USN After we got airborne and began working the SSC part of the mission, going from altitude to get a radar plot, down to checking out specific ships, my stomach began to come unglued. My TACCO asked if I was alright and Russ expressed concern. We finished rigging another ship and Russ decided we would climb out, head to the area for the second part of our mission as the hijacked airliner and wait for the E-2 to commence the exercise. On the way, Lieutenant Bartlett would do something that changed my life. “Come up front.” My stomach had calmed down since I’d emptied its contents. We safed our ejection seats and Lieuantant R. D. climbed out of the COTAC’s seat and traded places with me. I climbed into the COTAC seat (the first time I’d ever flown up front), strapped in and was immediately awed by the incredible view my pilots and COTACs had. We rearmed the ejection seats and then Russ told me he was going to fly a series of maneuvers. He took us through turns and then we did an aileron roll. My stomach became uncomfortable but nothing like it was while sitting in back.  He then took us through a loop. “Now, you fly the airplane.” WTF! ME? I had never flown an airplane before. With caution and some reluctance, I put my hand around the stick. Russ then talked me through turns (he kept a light touch on his control stick and did the throttle work). Then, an aileron roll ( that amazed me and scared the hell out of me). Then, he took me through a loop. All the while, he kept a running commentary forcing my mind to focus on what I was doing and not listening to my stomach. Once finished with this final maneuver, he explained some things: “In the back, your inner ear is tumbling as the airplane maneuvers. However, because you are enclosed back there with sparse reference to the aircraft’s movement and you are monitoring your screens, your eyes tell your brain a perceived truth that you’re not moving. That conflict between eyes and inner ear causes you to get sick. Being up front allows you to have clear movement references. Even better, being in control occupies your brain. Unless you become a pilot or an NFO [Naval Flight Officer], you’re not going to get up front here on a regular basis. So, when the airplane starts maneuvering or it’s a bumpy flight, take more time to look at the COTAC’s artificial horizon [most of the time you could see it if the COTAC’s flight gear didn’t get in the way]. More importantly, start telling your brain what is happening and that it’s okay.” After all the maneuvering and discussion, I realized something…I didn’t feel any nausea! I wanted to stay up there for the rest of my life, but it was time for the second part of our mission.  Once again, we safed our seats and as I climbed out, I turned and stood for a moment looking out of the front windscreen…such an incredible, beautiful view! I returned to my seat and we heard the E-2 calling, telling us to squawk the hijack IFF code. A very maneuverable aircraft causing much discomfort for those in the back seats. A VS-29 S-3 in the vertical., USN Lieutenant Bartlett saved me that day. After that flight—no less than seven years of additional flying—I never threw up again. Over the next two years, we would fly together many times and his mastery of the aircraft and the air would once again save me, our crew and, our airplane from near-disaster. Russ would stay with VS-24 for our next Med cruise aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt and he would be selected “1989 US Navy S-3 Pilot of the Year.” His humble ambition opened amazing doors for him, allowing him to slide into his next skin: The F/A-18 Hornet. As a fighter pilot, he would come back home to CAG-8 and fly 33 combat missions from the Roosevelt ’s deck with VFA-15 during Operation Desert Storm. In 1999, he would command his own Hornet squadron and then, in 2002, reach the pinnacle of his career by being selected as the Blue Angel’s boss for the 2003-2004 airshow season. A genuinely brilliant life for a genuinely great soul and I had the honor of flying with him! Unknown Contact! We stayed for what seemed an eternity on BENO station. Sadly, our presence did nothing to liberate Terry Waite or the other hostages (Waite would remain a prisoner until 1991). As the Mediterranean winter transitioned into spring, I gained flight hours, experience and, to some degree, confidence in myself as a Viking SENSO. However, the battle group was about to enter into a major Sixth Fleet/NATO exercise known as Dragon Hammer ’87, and I would face another opportunity to be hammered by yet another dragon that would force me to get a clue as to just how much responsibility a single, kid-AW in a multi-million dollar aircraft had in determining whether we would kill an enemy or a friend. During the intel brief, we were informed we would be searching for an Orange Force (enemy) submarine of the Italian Sauro class. All U.S. nuclear submarines (nucs) were operating as Blue Force (friendly) and were in designated “safe” boxes to ensure there would be no “Blue on Blue” engagements, something that was common in exercises and, tragically, far too common during wartime. The intel officer warned us, however, that one of the U.S. boats was close to the expected position of the enemy Sauro . I thought to myself: “Diesel vs. nuc? No problem!” Upon launching from the Nimitz ’ deck, we were immediately vectored to a datum of a suspected enemy submarine “snorkeling” about 150 miles along the carrier’s PIM (Path of Intended Movement). The pilot pushed the throttles “to the stops,” as they say, and I prepared my system for classifying the contact. USN We arrived on top and the submarine was still there…still at periscope depth (PD)…and according to the front-seaters, only a periscope was visible. This was odd. It was broad daylight.  The boat wasn’t moving. It wasn’t snorkeling. Just before we marked on top the TACCO popped a buoy out and just after we passed over the periscope, he dropped another. The pilot, in a startled voice, said “I can see it clearly! She’s just hovering there with her periscope out of the water!” One of the two NFOs chimed in: ”So what you’re saying, then, is it isn’t a POSSUB?” I’m sure the pilot turned to whoever said it and raised his middle finger. Meanwhile, he was setting up for another pass down the right side of the aircraft so the COTAC could get a look-see and hopefully classify the boat. After all, our NFOs were far more ASW-minded than our bus-driving pilots. “Yeah, it’s a submarine alright.” Dammit! Well, we AWs trained regularly in visual recognition of submarines. I asked the pilot to bring it down the left side of the aircraft in hopes of getting a very short, limited glance at it.  “Let the recce-expert see it, I’ll make the call!” I said in my head. He obliged. I reported to the TACCO that I wasn’t seeing or hearing anything distinctive from this contact that I could use to make a classification with. That was good news. The odds were clearly against it being one of the friendly U.S. nuclear boats. He warned me we were almost there and I pasted my face against my tiny, tiny window….and it flashed by. Dear God! It had a sail with sailplanes ! All U.S. nuclear-powered submarines had a sail with sailplanes. It had a periscope with a camouflaged tube ! US nuclear submarines had periscopes with camouflaged tubes. I wiped the gathering beads of sweat from my forehead just as Alpha-Xray asked again: “Scout 702, classify the contact. Is it an enemy or friend?!” The TACCO looked at me. The COTAC twisted his body around to look back at me. “SENSO?” “I…ummm…I…she has sailplanes and a camouflaged periscope! Is it a friendly? U.S. boats have those things!” Sauro class submarine. This is basically the perspective of what I saw, except she was at periscope depth, distorted by the water and my tiny window., Italian Navy We climbed a little bit and I watched as my system began to process the buoys we had dropped.  I had been anticipating the noises of a diesel submarine just as we approached, but with no snorkel up, I really didn’t know what I would find. The TACCO established radio contact with the ASW commander for the battle group, “Alpha-Xray,” and informed him what we had come upon. His immediate question: “Enemy or friendly submarine?” The first trickle of sweat rolled down my spine. The crew asked me to answer Alpha-Xray’s question. My system was still processing the first transmissions from the two sonobuoys. I willed a submarine signature to start showing itself on my display. Nothing was showing. Since he had such a clear view of the submarine, just below the surface, I asked the pilot to describe what he saw—better to deflect responsibility for a moment and buy time while I quietly begged the system to reveal its secrets. “It’s a submarine!” “Yes, sir, but was it large? Did it have the hull of a U.S. nuc or a short hull expected of a diesel?” “It’s a submarine!” There was a collective sigh of frustration from my three officers. We began to discuss it. The COTAC rummaged through his helmet bag and pulled out a copy of An Illustrated Guide to Modern Sub Hunters and flipped through the pages. He started shaking his head: “The Sauro has sail planes!” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Worse, as the supposed expert on recce of submarines and warships, I should have already known that and should have prepared much better for this mission—this wartime mission. Even though he now had an S-3 Viking making passes over his periscope, the submarine commander still did not move, adding more pain to my attempt at solving this equation. “What do we do?” the pilot asked the TACCO. And then it happened. Over the ASW commander’s net came a voice different from the one we had been hearing from: “This is COMSIXTHFLEET, I need you gentlemen to make a decision. You are there. Is it an enemy submarine or not.” As we returned to the carrier to enter the overhead stack for recovery, not a word was spoken inside the cockpit except those verbalizations necessary for safe navigation of the aircraft. The t-shirt underneath my flightsuit was soaked (and I have to confess, the air conditioner in the Viking is the best damn AC unit I have ever experienced). I had a lot of time to think and I came to a full realization just how much responsibility I had sitting in that seat. Yes, my crew, my ship, my battlegroup, and even our fleet commander relied on the decisions I made about whether or not a submarine was friend or foe. Far more important and overwhelming, however, was that my decision could kill an entire crew of a U.S. Navy or Allied submarine. My decision:  50…80…120 lives. I was just a 21-year old kid, and in that seat, I was completely alone. S-3 about to trap., USN We were told in debriefing that the Sauro we had attacked had already been sunk by the U.S. nuc that was not too far away.  The Italian submarine skipper was just waiting out the required time before he could regenerate into another enemy submarine and continue the exercise. Why he had retracted his snorkel prior to our arrival was a mystery. Perhaps his batteries had a full charge? However, when COMSIXTHFLEET voice was heard on our radio, he had raised it again and resumed charging his batteries. My helmet was filled with the sound and my display with the visual representation of his diesel engines.  And why Alpha-Xray or COMSIXTHFLEET wasn’t aware of that fact just confirmed that even in an exercise the fog of war was very much present. Our attack, though carried out with an emotional mix of anger and triumph, was ultimately inconsequential, not to mention opportunistic in a shooting-fish-in-a-barrel sort of way. Dragon Hammer continued until May 15, 1987. I flew a few more missions, but the person manning the cockpit was a different Anti-submarine Warfare operator. And then, on the morning of May 18, history would once again mark the time. I walked into ready room four in pressed dungarees and my VS-24 ball cap preparing to do a turnover with the ASDO (Assistant Squadron Duty Officer) watch with my fellow AW who had been standing it the night before. I had just come from CVIC (carrier intelligence center), having picked up the squadron’s morning message traffic. It was my job to compile them and, based on time and security classification, sort them and then place them on the “message boards” to be read by the skipper, the XO, and all the officers. The off-going ASDO looked over my shoulder and said, “The XO and CO have already come through.  They are in a briefing with the battlegroup commander.” That was unusual. He reached for a message I was about to place on the “secret” board and said, “That one!” I read the subject line: Subj.: USS Stark attacked by missiles in Gulf For a day or so there was the usual Navy scuttlebutt going around that we would transit the Suez Canal and head into the Persian Gulf to launch strikes against whoever did this.  Thankfully, despite losing twenty-nine in the initial attack, the incredible crew of the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate fought to save their seemingly fragile warship and the Stark was able to limp to Bahrain. We stayed in the Med and two days later anchored in Augusta Bay just off the east coast of Sicily to commence our turnover with the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63). As has been done since the birth of the Sixth Fleet in 1950, weapons, supplies, equipment and sometimes aircraft were transferred from the carrier ending her tour to the one replacing her. And just like that, my first Med cruise came to its end. Nimitz Battle Group resupplying in the Med in 1987. , USN We weighed anchor and headed west toward Gibraltar. Unfortunately, I really didn’t grasp the historical significance of what would happen as we passed through the Strait into the Atlantic, something the USS Nimitz had done at least ten times since 1976. Instead of maintaining a course west toward Norfolk, Virginia, her homeport since she was commissioned a warship of the United States Navy on May 3, 1975, we turned south and set sail for her new home on the west coast. The Nimitz would never again return to the Med as an aircraft carrier under the flag of the Atlantic Fleet. A Rite Of Passage Our passage south would take us across the equator to a port call in the exotic Brazilian port of Rio. We would then sail around the southern tip of South America through the infamous Cape Horn and head toward Bremerton, Washington, where Nimitz would call home, sailing under the flag of the Pacific Fleet. Although the crew was excited to depart the Med, we didn’t have the classic case of “channel fever,” that dangerous ailment that infects a crew heading home. We still had a full month to go at sea. As we made our way to the equator crossing, we did not do any flying. For me, Nimitz ’s bow became a place of rest and relaxation as I marveled at the different views the late afternoon sky and sunsets provided. A crossing of the equator on any American warship is a rite of passage, an important tradition.  Even as early as the 1980s, naval traditions were slipping through the fingers of sailors and were not being replaced with anything substantive. Being woken up by screaming voices and hands pounding stand-up lockers sent me back to that first morning at Great Lakes. My once faithful SENSO comrades had donned the clothes one would expect to find on pirates and herded us to the hangar bay to join a significant majority of the carrier’s crew. There, we were reminded that all humans were born a Wog (short for “Pollywog,” a tadpole or a sailor who has not yet crossed the line) and nothing was of a lower lifeform than a Wog. I won’t go into the particulars of the tradition here, but the remainder of the morning and early afternoon was spent experiencing advanced techniques in humiliation. My favorite was the competition between two Wogs to see which could blow the putrid water out of the padeyes that littered the carrier deck (these are where the aircraft tie-down chains are fastened to keep a plane from moving). Of course, one Wog is ordered to put their face just above the padeye while the other Wog is ordered to do the same on the opposite side. You can figure out the rest (yeah, my face was covered!). Also, having to squirm through a tunnel filled with the compiled garbage and wasted food of 5,800 sailors over the past few days was simply one of those bucket list moments! Shellback initiation aboard a US Navy ship circa 1982., USN A final favorite was having my face forced into the belly of the “royal baby” which was thick with catapult grease.  It wasn’t the grease that disturbed me, it was the fact that the Navy’s PFT (physical fitness training) program certainly wasn’t working. After enough entertainment was had by all of King Neptune’s court, we were all baptized and converted into the Order of the Shellback. It was a fantastic, needed experience that binds sailors together, reminding them just how unique and important their lives are with the Navy family. The ceremony also provides the perfect opportunity for the flight deck and the hangar bay to get a thorough scrub down which becomes a major exercise in the movement of aircraft. We continued on a south-by-southwesterly heading and pulled into Rio. As had been the practice of the Nimitz ’ Captain in the Med, we would only have three days to enjoy this port.  One of the things that strikes you when you arrive at the waterfront of any major seaport where the U.S. Navy visits is the obnoxious greeting you receive from the loud presence of McDonalds’ Golden Arches. In the face of all of the rich history and magnificent cuisine, the line of American sailors roping out the door of the American fast food joint is a genuine cultural tragedy. (I had a Big Mac, medium fry, and a large Dr. Pepper). A Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King helicopter from the U.S. Navy helicopter anti-submarine squadron HS-9 Sea Griffins of Carrier Air Wing Eight (CVW-8), assigned to the USS Nimitz and a Sikorsky/Agusta SH-3 Sea King helicopter from the Brazilian Navy squadron HS-1 lower AQS-13 dipping sonar during Exercise Topex 1-87, an anti-submarine warfare exercise in which four inter-mixed U.S. and Brazilian helicopter flight crews participated., USN Sadly, our brief stay in Rio wasn’t a good one. A couple of my squadron mates (not AWs) were arrested on what I recall were questionable charges. We ended up having to leave them there—a complicated story that goes beyond the legal issue; we had some difficult senior officers throughout the Nimitz that showed far too much self-interest than leadership. As we pulled out of Rio, our angry carrier CO berated VS-24 over the 1MC, or 1 Main Circuit, the ship’s public address system…and shortly after almost lost his job— and potentially some lives—as we nearly collided with an oil tanker. Fun times were had by all! Flight ops were once again suspended for the duration as we now raced south to the bottom of the world. The aircraft that couldn’t be stored in the hangar bay were tied down and sealed off against the elements. We all anticipated that our carrier would be tossed about by the weather and seas Cape Horn is notorious for.  We were surprised by a relatively clear, cold morning sky as the Nimitz ’ Navigator invited everyone to see the very southern tip of South America off our starboard side. We made our way quickly up the west coast of the Americas, not stopping to visit Chile or anywhere else. As we approached San Diego, our 10 Vikings were readied and 10 AWs were picked for the fly-off and cross-country flight back to Florida. I was very happy to be number 10. It was, in reality, very unfair to fellow AWs who had been in the squadron longer than I. But the Navy does things by rank. We flew, first to NAS North Island and stayed overnight. It was a remarkable “full-circle” for me to walk back into the Trainer Building and say hello to all my instructors.  All 10 of the flight crews were exhausted from our seven months at sea and slept the night away. Early the following morning, our 10 aircraft launched out of San Diego and flew across the incredibly beautiful expanse of the United States—well, what I could see of it out my tiny window, anyway. S-3s in formation., USN We refueled at Tinker AFB in Oklahoma and arrived at NAS Cecil Field in Florida in the early evening, having crossed through all of the countries’ time zones. It was good to be on solidly dry land. A first cruise is difficult for any sailor regardless of age, rank, or job title. For me, it was a loss of innocence and forced entry into the responsibility of being an adult. I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t prepared. I was actually angry with my brother for not telling me about what I would encounter. He wrote and told stories that were filled with the excitement of flying in the S-3 aboard the carrier.  However, he was far better prepared for the world of the sailor than I. My experience as a loner, growing up, prepared me to sit alone in my SENSO seat and become the best AW I could be. My desire for solitude failed me in an environment that feeds on teamwork and inter-reliance to make it through arduous times of being aboard ship. I quickly found out that any free time sailors had became time to find all the weak points of their fellow sailors and exploit them with various forms of harassment. If you showed any emotion, the feeding frenzy ensued. It was a brutal experience for a kid like me… and it was the greatest thing that could have ever happened to me. I had to grow-the-hell-up. I wish, among so many other things I failed to do, that I had had someone measure the thickness of my skin in December of 1986. I’m certain, had they done a second measurement in July of 1987, it would have been found to be considerably thicker. A Theoretical S-3 Viking Mission From Start To Finish Allow me to take you on a ride in the S-3A. It’ll be a morning hop from the deck of Nimitz that is scheduled to last 2 hours. When I woke up at 0500, on my way to take a shower, I checked the flight schedule which is posted on our berthing bulkhead. The OPS guys were usually up until the wee hours waiting for the Air Wing to figure out what was going to happen the following day. So, we usually hit the rack before the schedule was done. My launch time is 0700, so I’ll grab some breakfast in the main galley one deck below the hangar bay and be in the ready room for the briefing at 0615.  It’ll be the second launch of the day. Two birds are launching with the other collection of Air Wing aircraft. Both of us will be doing SSC missions, one ahead of the Nimitz’ s PIM and our aircraft, Scout 710 will be going north of the carrier. “Good mornings” are passed among the two crews, and we sit in the comfortable chairs as the ready room TV comes to life with the meteorological brief. The pilots and NFOs (Naval Flight Officers) make notes. The CAG intel officer then briefs today’s strike mission that the fighter and attack guys are going on. Although there will be no ASW brief from the ASMOD, the CAG intel guy gets our attention when he informs us that we will be looking for a North Korean freighter that entered the Med from the Suez Canal a week ago and is suspected of trying to deliver arms somewhere along the North African coast. A picture of it is shown. Then our own Squadron Duty Officer (SDO) briefs us on aircraft numbers, aircraft mission status, frequencies, codes and things for the pilots and NFOs to do their pilot and NFO shit with. Finally, my pilot turns to us and we begin our crew brief discussing the mission and then emergency procedures. I listen intently as he covers “Single Engine Failure off the Cat” with the COTAC and they go through the procedure together, actually acting it out as if they were in the cockpit. He then picks a random emergency procedure from Part V or “Section Five” of our NATOPS manual, usually something related to ejection or emergency egress from the aircraft. It is always something we long-ago committed to brain and muscle memory. He calls out “Man-Seat Separation Failure.” As we verbalize it together, I close my eyes and act it out in my chair: Harness release handle – squeeze/pull Occupant – rotate forward Seat – forcibly push away D-ring – manually pull The TACCO and I then head out of the Ready Room and go forward down the long passageway on the O-3 level to the ASMOD to pick up the TTC (Tape Transport Cartridge) and ATR (Analog Tape Recorder). I check in with the AWs to see if there are any submarines of interest out there. They tell us that a Soviet Foxtrot class diesel boat left its anchorage off Tunisia four days ago and for us to be on the lookout for it. My TACCO heads to CVIC to get the 35mm intel camera and I head to the VS-24 Paraloft to suit up for the flight. I enter the paraloft, which is a few doors down from our ready room. My flight gear, along with the individual gear of every other AW, pilot and NFO in the squadron, is hanging from one of the pegs along the bulkhead. I pull on all my flight gear and make my way out to the flight deck. A Navy pilot gears up for a flight in the paraloft. , USN As I reach the flight deck, I put my helmet on since the HS-9 plane guard Sea King is launching.  Aircraft 710 is on elevator #1 and I only have a short walk to take from the protection of the carrier’s island superstructure. As I move forward, my head begins a constant swivel looking for turning propellers, speeding MD-3 flight deck tractors or ‘huffer’ carts, purple shirts hauling fuel hoses, and aircraft either under tow or taxiing. After passing two A-7s and an F-14, I find 710 with the APU (auxiliary power unit) already started. I greet the flight deck crew with a smile and climb up into the bird, checking to see the head-knockers (ejection seat arming levers) on the TACCO and SENSO’s ejection seats are down (safe) and put my helmet bag and ATR on my ejection seat. I then drop back out of the crew hatch and begin a quick external preflight, checking avionics bays for secured boxes, the Liquid Oxygen (LOX) bay for any signs of frost or ice on the 10 liter LOX ‘bottle’ (which looks more like a green basketball than a bottle), landing gear tires for undue wear, the engine fan blades for damage and consistency, the tailhook for damage, and the presence of a “remove before flight” pin. Finally, I check the 60 sonobuoy chutes for buoy placement, secureness, and the load we want to carry. Kevin pre-flighting the S-3 Viking., Personal Photo During the entire inspection, I keep an eye out for hydraulic and fuel leaks or puddles.  Frequently, with such a relatively large aircraft, the tail of the Viking is hanging over the deck or elevator edge precluding any preflight. It is then that we truly rely on the professional attention to detail of the squadron plane captain (brown shirt) , maintenance techs and mechs (green shirts), and final checkers (white shirts with a checkerboard spray-painted on it) to check that portion of the aircraft before they park it in that position and after we begin to taxi to the catapult. Climbing back into the aircraft, I move into the avionics tunnel to load my ATR and check all the avionics boxes ensuring they are mounted correctly. After checking the circuit breaker panels, I perform my most important preflight: inspection of my ejection seat. By the time I sit down, the TACCO is just settling in and the pilot is starting #1 engine. The hatch is closed and #2 engine is started. The TACCO then turns power on to the GPDC and starts the loading sequence from the TTC. If we have any problems with the load, and there is time before the launch starts, the pilot will shutdown the #2 engine to allow the troubleshooting techs to determine the source of the problem. As the computer loads, I’m checking my own boxes and screens at my station to ensure I have a system that is completely ready. I sit and listen intently to the talk in the cockpit, particularly between the two front seaters. They have an informed view of what is going on outside the aircraft and any safety issues, such as the very real possibility of an aircraft crashing on deck or one catching fire, that will be relayed by them directing what actions, if any, we in the back should take. They also will begin the checklists that will require us to arm our ejection seats as soon as the plane captain gets permission to remove the chains binding us to the flight deck. An S-3 crew prepared for launch. , USN As we taxi, I’m going through my various sensor systems ensuring they are working correctly.  Meanwhile, the COTAC or pilot is giving us a running commentary of where we are on the flight deck (particularly at night and/or in bad weather) providing us with situational awareness. You learn to listen to the tone of the officers’ voices to have that additional understanding of what is happening. This is so critical because an aircraft carrier deck, despite its layer of non-skid, is a very slippery place where airplanes regularly slide along, sometimes beyond what the yellow shirt directing the aircraft intends. Add a stormy night when you are trying to get to a catapult on a moving deck and it can be downright terrifying. On one such terrible night, a sliding aircraft and the fear heard in the voices of the front seaters caused a SENSO in another squadron to self-eject, thinking the aircraft was going over the deck edge into the ocean. Thankfully, he survived and the aircraft stayed on the deck. The always amazing yellow shirts direct us from our parking spot to the waist catapults. I hated launching from Cat 4 since our left main-mount tire rubbed the deck edge scupper and out my tiny window was nothing but ocean. I loved launching from Cat 4 because it was the shortest track of the four catapults on a modern carrier deck. Thus, it provided the most powerful cat shot, particularly if you had a heavy airplane. As we turn sharply by elevator 4, I see that we are being readied to go to Cat 4 (dammit and yay!). View from the cockpit as the S-3 prepares to taxi aboard the boat. , USN We are positioned behind the raised Jet Blast Deflector (JBD) of cat 3 where an E-2 is just going to full power—it just had to wait for us and the other S-3 to pass before it unfolded its wings.  The pilot calls for the stowing of the INCOS trays (our control interfaces in the back) as the Hawkeye quickly disappears from view. Cat 3’s JBD is retracted back into the flight deck, giving us a clear path to cat 4. We’re next. We taxi forward, the pilot unfolds the wings and we are hooked up to the catapult shuttle. I deselect ‘hot mic’ on my intercom system control panel ensuring that the engine sound at full power will not bleed over the intercom system, dangerously interfering with cockpit communication. If I see or smell something wrong, I’ll simply shift my foot to the foot pedal actuator on the floor and let them know. I glance around at the right-side circuit breaker panel, look at the TACCO and his station to make sure he looks hooked up and ready to go. I give him a thumbs up and look over my station one last time. The airplane goes to full power and I assume the position , ensuring my entire body is in the proper ‘ejection envelope.’ If something goes terribly wrong, I will not have time to think about where my arms, legs, or head is. Should one of the front seaters pull their ejection handles, my seat’s rocket motor will have me clear of the aircraft in 4/10ths of a second, separated from my seat in 7/10ths of a second and I’ll be underneath a full canopy in 3.7 seconds regardless of whether or not my neck is broken. The pilot then does his full ‘wipeout’ of the controls and calls out particular instruments that the COTAC confirms are good for a proper launch. The engines are screaming and airplane is bucking against the holdback fitting and the COTAC looks back to see two thumbs up from the both of us in the back. Boom! We are racing down the track and with a jolt we are airborne! USN The aircraft banks quickly to the left performing the requisite clearing turn to ensure we don’t collide with someone launching from the bow catapults—there isn’t anyone but we do it every time regardless or the Air Boss will make sure the pilot knows he failed to do so in his usual, loving and condescending manner on UHF for all to hear. Wings go back level, the gear are up, and everyone relaxes a bit. Launching and trapping are always the most dangerous moments in naval aviation. So, what just happened there, from the moment we manned the aircraft to this point we are climbing out away from the ship, not a single radio transmission is made by anyone on the carrier or in an airplane during a day VFR launch, unless there is an emergency. Not a word! I am still humbled by this tremendous fact. If we aren’t under EMCON (emissions control—basically radio frequency silence) conditions, I ask the COTAC to put power to the radar and I get down to work. As we climb to altitude and check in with the E-2 for tasking or vectoring, I begin my search in a relatively small scale on my radar screen. My desire is to develop an immediate picture of what radar contacts we have around the carrier. I also want to try and catch any airborne targets to warn the pilot of the presence of another aircraft. Although I really couldn’t determine altitude, the APS-116 radar did a really good job detecting aircraft. As contact was made, I ‘hooked’ it with my trackball and created a radar symbol on everybody’s display. If, say, there was a large collection of fishing vessels in one locale, I’d mark one contact and inform the TACCO of the number of boats so as not to clutter our displays. The E-2 does have tasking for us. Real-time intel suspects that the North Korean freighter might be in a shipping lane 140 miles to our north. We level off at a good cruising altitude and I extend the range of my radar display and begin to mark contacts. Since it will take a while to get there the inevitable cockpit talk begins and fattened helmet bags are relieved of their contents.  I might have some candy bars I share with the other three, they might have crackers or a couple of cans of Coke or Pepsi. The discussions are always informative and fun. My enlisted-ness was left on the flight deck but there was always the standing rule: what’s talked about in the cockpit, stays in the cockpit. Of course, if one of the senior officers (Lieutenant Commander or above) was in the cockpit with us, it might be a quiet flight. However, if you’re flying with the Ops or Maintenance Department officer or the XO or CO, they tended to loosen their tongue and we had tabloid access to the latest Air Wing, carrier, and battlegroup gossip. Being the sole enlisted guy in the aircraft had its unexpected benefits! Normally, when doing an SSC mission, we would make a radar plot and then drop down to investigate as many of ships as time and tasking allowed. If of interest, the COTAC would take a picture of the ship. On this flight, we just plotted the ship returns and made our way to the area that the North Korean ship might be. As we get closer to the site, the TACCO sets up a search box and I mark every radar contact. We have plenty of fuel, so we drop down and begin a systematic search. We aren’t going to spend any time with each ship, just check to see if it resembles the intel pic the COTAC has in hand. If there are multiple ships in the area, I alternate between radar and FLIR to visually rule out ships that are clearly not similar. If we think there is one, we go over and take a closer look. Also, I am constantly updating my radar contacts. By doing so, the GPDC (mission computer) takes my multiple entries and estimates the speed and direction of movement the contact is making, displaying it on everyone’s scope. The good thing about cargo ships is that they rarely alter course or change speed since their owners want them to go from point A to point B as quickly and fuel efficiently as possible. Warships are another matter. If we gain contact on one and determine visually that it is a warship, it automatically gets our full attention. We report these immediately and give them extra care, especially if they belong to an unfriendly nation. After another hour, none of the contacts develop into the North Korean boat. Clearly, we won’t be making it back to the carrier for our scheduled recovery, but when you’re flying in the S-3, that isn’t a problem. We hear the E-2 calling, but not on our UHF frequency. “Scout 710, Bear Ace on guard.” We climb up to altitude due to poor radio reception with the Hawkeye and try to get them on UHF. “Bear Ace, Scout 710 on UHF.” “Scout 710, read you. Ident and say fuel.” The COTAC determines the fuel state and radios it to the E-2. “Roger that, 710. Go UHF secure.” We comply. “Scout 710, read you loud and clear. New tasking. Possible subsurface contact bearing 176 from you, 102 miles. Detected by Briar Patch. Briar Patch heading in that direction from the south, ETA 1.5 hours. Mother and escorts have gone EMCON and are moving further south. Be advised, Intel states no expected Soviet submarine in this area. Your signal is buster.” The E-2 is telling us that one of our escorts, call sign Briar Patch, had an ESM (electronic support measures, basically RF emissions) hit north of its position from an emitter usually only seen from a Soviet nuclear submarine. We passed over Briar Patch, a Knox class frigate on our way up here.  So, the origin of this ESM hit is between us and our escort. We didn’t get the hit for our own ESM systems since we were down low checking surface ship names. We are to head there at fastest, practical speed. As always, the pilot is keeping a running tally on our fuel load. “Bear Ace, Scout. Roger that. Advise Mom to have another Viking ready if we do obtain contact.  We estimate only 1 hour on station due to fuel expended and Mom’s move away from us.” The E-2 acknowledged. Thank God for the ever-present angel that the Hawkeye always was for Vikings everywhere. The TACCO instructs me to turn off the radar as the pilot pushes the throttles forward and we climb out to take up the prescribed heading. “I don’t want him to know we are up here if he hasn’t already figured it out. We’ll wait until we are in the suspected area before we radar flood.” I “Roger that, Sir” and turn the APS-116 off. USN I get my acoustic system ready and tune-up one of the 31 frequencies available to us to get the system processing. I also check additional frequencies to see if anything is being transmitted on them since there is shipping in the area and the coast of Crete is relatively close. Unfortunately, the frequency range allotted for sonobuoys transmission just so happens to be used by dispatching companies, fire and police departments, and doctor’s messaging beepers…at least in the United States, anyway. Any sort of RF transmissions could interfere with my reception from the sonobuoys. It’s not expected, but I always want to be ready. “ESM hit from a Snoop Tray!” the COTAC excitedly calls out. At the same time, the TACCO says a Link 11 ESM contact is displayed giving a relatively good fix on where the possible submarine might be transmitting. It’s looking more and more like an actual submarine since the transmissions are only single sweeps. She is clearly trying to find the battlegroup with her mast-extended Snoop Tray radar. I ask the TACCO if I can radiate to try and gain contact on the exposed masts. He hesitates, then says “No. We have a fix, let’s go in and drop a pattern and try and maintain some measure of surprise.” We begin to descend to a good altitude to drop sonobuoys. The TACCO has been talking with the frigate, convincing the ship’s TAO to convince the ship’s skipper to stop their highspeed run toward the contact and deploy their SQR-19 towed sonar array since we are going to be on top of the fix in a few minutes. Alpha-Xray comes up on our frequency and informs us that the S-3 they had planned to send to relive us, due to our diminishing fuel, is ‘mission-down,’ probably meaning they don’t have a good system. Another Viking won’t be able to get here for another two hours. They have decided to send an A-6 tanker out to refuel us. Additionally, NAS Sigonella is going to launch its alert P-3 and a Royal Navy Nimrod operating out of Cyprus has changed course and is headed this way. Clearly, Sixth Fleet has been caught off guard by this contact. The TACCO sets up a pre-planned pattern of sonobuoys and sends a Fly-To-Point (FTP) to the pilot’s limited screen—he can only see symbology, such as this FTP or a radar contact, we don’t want him distracted by an actual radar or FLIR display. “I’m not going to drop a BT buoy right away. That temp probe will make too much noise.”After a few more minutes the TACCO calls “60 seconds for first drop. Keep an eye out for a feather.” I hear a pop as the SSQ-53 DIFAR buoy is ejected from our aircraft and the TACCO calls “RF2 away.” I instantly tune up RF2 and begin to listen. You can actually hear the buoy’s hydrophone descend to its depth. Even as it descends to its preset depth, the buoy begins to transmit the sounds the ocean is making. I look hard for that classic signature associated with a variety of Soviet submarines that have a Snoop Tray radar. Nothing. “After we lay this initial pattern, we’ll climb out and hook up with the tanker,” the pilot tells the TACCO. As if on cue: “Scout 710, Bear Ace. Raygun 502 bears 196 at 27, angles 15, left-hand pattern.” Raygun was the callsign for an A-6E tanker from VA-35 Black Panthers “RF 10 away. Depth for this one is 200 feet. I’m going to alternate as we go along.”  Since we didn’t drop a BT buoy to evaluate the temperature of the water down to a depth of 1000 feet, we don’t know where the ‘layer’ is. Buoys placed at 90 feet and then 200 feet attempts to get a hydrophone above and below a possible layer in hopes of gaining contact. We laid the remaining buoys and I tuned each one up, waiting for the information to populate. It was a 12-buoy pattern so I could watch all of them at the same time. In the S-3, we could display 16 buoys at one time. The S-2 Tracker, on the other hand, could only watch four at a time.  And just as the pilot said, we began to climb out to meet the tanker. NATOPS only required an oxygen mask to be worn by the crew during a controlled ejection.  It left the option to the crew to wear one during launch, recovery and inflight refueling with the exception of tanking above 10,000 feet or refueling from a KC-135 or KC-10. The Intruder slowly grew in front of us, its drogue already hovering in the sky behind it. “IFR checklist complete,” the COTAC called over the intercom. My oxygen mask was on and my visor was down. I glanced one more time out the front windscreen and advanced my display on the MPD.  On my upper screen, I began to see something on RF22, one of the last buoys dropped and set at 200 feet. I quickly brought that buoy up on my MPD. Yes! “Contact RF22, subsurface contact, very weak. Possibly a Victor class SSN. No other buoy contact at this time.” As I’m saying this, the pilot eases our refueling probe into the tanker’s drogue with just a hint of vertical movement. Contact RF22! Subsurface contact. SENSO station MPD (lower screen) and Auxiliary Readout Unit (upper screen)., Lockheed Martin “Alpha-Xray, Scout 710 has subsurface contact on RF22, possible Victor class SSN.” The buoy was placed on Link-11 as soon as it was dropped, so the battlegroup will know where in the world it is. “Damnit! We aren’t getting gas.” ‘Raygun, Scout, are you seeing any fuel transfer?’ “Negative, 710.” Our attention is now divided between this surprising contact and the fact that we might not be able to take on gas. The pilot backs us out and away from the drogue. He might not have hit it hard enough to get it to transfer fuel. He increases the throttle and hits it pretty solidly. “Scout 710, Alpha-Xray. Briar patch has contact.” We only have two UHF radios so we are only talking to the A-6 and the ASW commander. Wish we could talk with the Knox class frigate directly to find out what they are classifying it as. Their towed array is far more sensitive than my DIFAR buoys. “Losing contact on RF22, Sir. Gaining very weak contact on RF30.” The last buoy in the pattern, also set at 200 feet. The submarine is moving south, toward the carrier. We have got to get some gas so we can lay more buoys! “710, still no transfer. We got a good package check from an F-14 just before we headed your way.” “Roger that, Raygun. Break. Bear Ace, 710, we have to bingo to the boat right now.” KA-6D about to refuel and S-3., USN Damnit! We won’t be able to go down and track this guy. Thankfully, the tail ship has contact. “Alpha-Xray, 710. Interrogative, P-3 or Nimrod?” “Scout 710, Alpha-Xray. Standby.” The E-2 vectors us and the tanker to the carrier while the TACCO gets the ETA on the P-3 and Nimrod. The former is an hour out, the latter about an hour and a half. The frigate will hopefully maintain contact. We don’t have enough fuel to go back down and drop a proper tracking pattern. And there is something peculiar about this Victor . I should have contact on several buoys at one time. I continue to watch it fade in and quickly fade out on RF30. “Alpha-Xray, Scout 710. Lost contact RF30.” “Roger that, 710. Briar Patch has intermittent contact.” We returned to the ship with vectors from the E-2 since the carrier went to EMCON to keep the submarine from finding her. This includes no TACAN emission. We had enough fuel to come in for a CASE I recovery, meaning no radio communications with the carrier since it was still visual flight rules conditions. Of course, the boat would have had us do a Carrier Controlled Approach had the weather been bad or had we been making a night recovery . Because everybody’s faster than us, the A-6 had already recovered and we broke at the bow. The pilot did call the ball on the radio and gave our very low fuel state. The pilot caught the “3-wire” and the LSOs gave him a grade of “OK.” Back aboard safely. A VS-32 S-3 is directed out of the arresting gear aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)., USN I quickly pulled the ATR out of the recorder and made my way to the ASMOD. The TACCO and COTAC beat me there by a few minutes. All of us are still in our flight gear, all three of our helmets resting on the watch officer’s desk. During the debrief, we reviewed the tape. We also found out the reason why the Victor was so quiet.  She was a Victor III. S o, this is how a complete mission from the carrier might go. This was all just a story I made up to show some of the detail of a typical flight…and a ‘typical’ flight might just have turned out like this in the 1980s when you’re flying off an aircraft carrier in the Med, the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, or the Western Pacific. Actually, some of the particulars did happen to me, such as not being able to refuel in flight when we had already called ‘bingo fuel.’ Thankfully, we weren’t operating in a Blue Water Ops situation and we made an emergency landing at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico with both of our ‘fuel low’ lights glowing ominously. Also, I have never tracked a Victor III or any other boats of the Victor class. Regardless, it’s a good end-to-end look at how life in the S-3 could unfold on any given day while deployed. In The Enlisted We Trust One of the genuinely amazing things about the U.S. Navy is how they train and then rely on enlisted personnel to perform critical missions that can hold the lives of many fellow sailors and objects of great monetary value in the balance. The S-3 was not alone in having an aircraft whose primary mission, at the time, relied on the training and professional performance of an enlisted Naval Aircrewman. The maritime patrol community relied on three AWs to contribute to the historical success of the P-3 Orion. USN Additionally, I will never be able to say enough about the helo community where the AWs in the back of the SH-3 Sea King, the SH-2 Seasprite, and the SH-60B Seahawk not only performed similar tasks as their fixed-wing brethren, but routinely risked their lives as SAR swimmers by leaving their aircraft “so others may live.” In my view, these guys defined the concept of hero each and every day the rotors turned overhead.

The following is the first in a multi-part series—the most in-depth we have published since our Paul Nickell series —about what it was like to train, fly, and fight in the Lockheed S-3 Viking . It’s a personal story not just about one man’s passion for his profession and his time executing it in the jet, but also about the nuts and bolts of often misunderstood anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, what it took to keep Soviet submarines at bay during the twilight years of the Cold War, and on more contemporary issues surrounding the critical art of hunting enemy submarines. It also comes to us from one of The War Zone community’s favorite people, Kevin Noonan, better known as Ancient Sub Hunter in our commenting section and on his colorful Twitter feed . So, without further ado, our deep dive begins, well, at the beginning as our subject set out to accomplish his dream and began to master the cat-and-mouse art of hunting submarines from the sky. A Viking Love Affair For an aircraft originally designed to hunt submarines, the Lockheed S-3 Viking repeatedly impressed the navy it served and those it flew against with its versatility, reliability, mission prowess, and its uncanny ability to evolve. The Viking held her stride no matter what task she was called upon to perform. She served a spectrum of needs within the carrier battle group (CVBG), while eagerly stepping up to the call of the odd jobs assigned by fleet commanders and even serving national political demands. Most importantly, the S-3 performed her primary mission of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) with a finesse that can only be fostered when deeply professional aircrews and maintenance personnel are fused with a durable, forgiving, and well-designed airframe. Twin turbofan engines carried the Viking’s 35,000 to 50,000 pounds and four crew to any mission asked of her and kept us airborne for up to six hours without the need for refueling. Her variety of sensors and weapons ensured we could detect and destroy targets both beneath and on the surface of the ocean that threatened the CVBG. The tasking required of the S-3 would send her far and wide from the carrier and her 450 knots maximum speed allowed her to get from one place to another at a decent clip. Granted, in the jet-age of sexy-fast Tomcats, Phantoms, and Intruders, 450 knots was relatively slow. But so are submarines. As one of the four souls onboard the Viking, I was the sole enlisted man sitting behind the pilot and co-pilot/COTAC (Co-Tactical Coordinator) sharing the aft cockpit with the TACCO (Tactical Coordinator). My primary job was operating the acoustic, radar, and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) systems. My official title was SENSO—Sensor Operator. I loved my job. Kevin alongside his beloved S-3 while aboard the carrier. , Kevin Noonan Dreams Of Submarines And Wings I was born into an Air Force officer’s family. The obvious question follows and was asked repeatedly over my lifetime: “Why then did you join the Navy?” Clearly, there is a touch of the sea and sailor in the bloodstream since my father had initially joined the Coast Guard and served in the North Atlantic on a weather observation cutter. But the aviation gene won the day when he headed off to a commission in the USAF once he completed college. The skies of my memory are filled with the scenes and sounds of B-52s, C-124s, KC-135s, and F-105s. These daily sights, along with all the visiting aircraft—not to mention the view from my front yard of the north end of the General Dynamics plant—ensured the activation of my own predisposition to flying. However, an odd mutation arose one day in the library of my 5th grade schoolhouse. While scanning the shelves for something to read about airplanes, I discovered a book about submarines. As the formative years progressed, aviation remained the primary influence while a love for the submarine continued to germinate. Being the baby of six kids and two years’ distant from my nearest sibling, I would lock myself in my room and read any book I could get my hands on about submarines. I found myself particularly fascinated with the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. This rising infatuation with the submarine and my tendency to be a loner would both serve me well—and not so well—in the quickly approaching years of adulthood and the direction my life would take. There was no question that I would join the military, but which branch? My oldest brother headed off to jump out of airplanes with the Army. My oldest sister became a linguist in the USAF. My next oldest sister headed off to the USN as a Hospital Corpsman. Another sister became a Personnelman. But it was my other older brother’s chosen career that would introduce me to a field and aircraft that, surprisingly, I’d neither heard of nor seen: Aviation Anti-submarine Warfare Operator (AW) and the S-3A Viking. Me in a Huey at the Carswell AFB Base Exchange parking lot circa 1974., Kevin Noonan Training With A Cherry On Top I had no idea that my competing, dissimilar loves had been fused together a decade before into the singular AW rating (Naval Aircrewman). Yet, in the final months of decision making, I remained torn between becoming a submariner or an aviator. When I finally did make the decision to become an AW, I felt I needed to take a path different from the one my Naval Aircrewman brother had taken. Instead of active duty, I chose the Naval Reserves (NAVRES). Instead of the S-3 Viking, which did not have an established Reserve squadron as the Patrol Squadron Navy had, I would be an Acoustic Sensor Operator in the Lockheed P-3B Orion. Even as a Reservist, I would go to all the initial active duty training required of regular Navy sailors. A week after I graduated from high school, I was on my way to boot camp at Great Lakes, Illinois in the early summer of 1984. I then headed to that magnificent (and terrifying) place: the home of Naval Aviation, Pensacola, Florida. There, in Naval Aircrewman Candidate School, I earned the right to fly in naval aircraft…boy, did I earn that right! It was there I learned how to aggressively exceed my established self-limitations. The endless running through the Naval Air Station’s historic streets and the challenge of the beach-side obstacle course was as exhilarating as it was exhausting. I was overwhelmed with the marching, inspections, and workouts on the famous sea wall where in decades past the seaplanes of a then-fledgling Naval Aviation cadre were taxied down ramps and into the bay for launching. But it was the required water survival training that would force me to run headlong into a reality my new employer, the U.S. Navy, had not yet discovered. I was terrified of water. Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. What the hell was wrong with me? Joining the Navy was bad enough, but then I chose to go into a field that required I get thrown into the very environment that made my soul tremble. And the greatest dragon I would have to face was waiting for me in a building I ran past every day. As a child, I experienced a near-drowning. Fully aware I would have to come to terms with my fear, I decided to take swimming lessons a few months prior to my departure for bootcamp. While it helped, I remained a relatively weak swimmer. Thankfully, Pensacola anticipated that some of its prospective flyers would not have been born with the requisite fin and gills that so many “natural” swimmers seem to be adorned with. Each time I entered any body of water, I was required to wear the “cherry” red helmet. This bold covering assured that the water survival instructors would keep an extra, wary eye on the tenuous swimmer wearing it. With a beacon on head, my journey began. In days past, all officer and enlisted candidates were required to pass a mile-long swim qualification in Pensacola Bay wearing a flight suit, helmet, and flight boots. When I arrived in 1984, they had moved this critical qualification to one of the indoor pools. You had to swim without stopping to rest, without putting your foot on the bottom, and without touching the side of the pool. Along with these difficult demands, the presence of many future aircrewmen swimming around the pool churned up what felt like a sea state of six! I was pretty sure the bay would have been the better locale. Another very difficult one was treading water in full flight gear without an inflated life preserver. Again, no touching the side of the pool and we were in the deep end so we couldn’t rest our feet on the bottom, though several sank and had to be brought back to the surface by the attending rescue swimmers. Having survived those basic evolutions, we moved on to other pools with progressively ominous and (I was convinced) torturous devices. One intriguing contraption that had the appearance of a praying mantis folding its laundry was the next challenge. Known as the Parachute Disentanglement Trainer, it actually wasn’t a very difficult evolution. The parachute was centered and then dropped over you. Initially, it kind of left you with the impression that you were lying in a water bed and someone just covered you with a silk top sheet. But then you ask yourself: “why is this top sheet trying to kill me?” Getting out of this potential nightmare required taking fistfuls of increasingly water-logged silk and what seemed like thousands of parachute lines and moving them over your head as you attempted to move slowly away from the center of the canopy. You then ensured that not a single parachute line was wrapped around any part of your body. The Praying Mantis…more appropriately, the Parachute Disentanglement Trainer., USN The full weight of this training has remained with me to this day. A search and rescue (SAR) swimmer once warned that if the parachute canopy an aircrew survivor had just used to escape a dying aircraft remained attached to him, it could fully blossom underneath the surface of the water and sink, taking the helicopter down with it if the survivor was also attached to the helicopter’s hoist. Thus, the absolute need to quickly peel away the shock of where you are at, having just bailed out of a doomed airplane and the absolute need to become aware of your surroundings and discover what direction the wind is blowing on the surface of the ocean. Then, just before impact with the water, turning your parachute to ensure it collapses downwind from you as you release the risers and settle into the water as your feet hit. These were procedures you had to execute under duress to ensure you don’t end up being drowned by silken sheets. Thankfully, the Navy eventually developed saltwater activated riser release mechanisms that would aid an unconscious survivor, but we were adamantly told to never rely on them if we were aware of our predicament. The truth is that I was beginning to really love this stuff, but then that day arrived. Dragon Slaying The Navy called her the 9D5 Helicopter Underwater Egress Training Device. She was commonly known as the “Helo-Dunker.” I knew her as my second chance at drowning. I don’t recall if we had ever been in the building before that day. If so, my fear blotted her out. When I entered the facility, the normally heavy and wet West Florida air suddenly became freezing cold. My pulse and respiration rate increased. I have always been rather pale in skin color, but I’m sure, if at that moment I had walked into a morgue, I would have been mistaken for just another cadaver. To me, the ‘Dunker looked like an engorged 55-gallon drum with six seats. They were running empty-tests as we filed onto one set of bleachers awaiting the egress briefing. The impact with the water … the rolling upside down …I noticed my instructor walk around the pool and sit down on another set of bleachers at the entrance to the device… the sinking of the 55-gallon drum with six seats . The device instructor began to speak: “You will be blindfolded for all the rides!” The class wasn’t happy about the blindfold. Personally, I didn’t give a damn since I weld my eyes shut anytime I’m in the water. I was far more interested in why the asshole called this a ride as if we were at an amusement park. A fucking ride … The 9D5 Helicopter Underwater Egress Training Device., USN I then stopped listening after he said we would have to ride the device three times. Or was it four? The first six members of my class made their way to the drum. I would go with the next six. I watched. They surfaced. I watched. They surfaced. I’m going to drown today . I watched. They surfaced. Divers in full gear were in the pool. The device instructor yelled: “Next six!” I walked behind one or two of my classmates. All I could see was my instructor sitting there…writing… not paying attention to the fact that one of his candidates was going to drown in a few minutes! My mind was pulsating: d.o.r….d.O.R!…D.O.R!! I turned the corner. I could move to my left, climb the bleachers and declare: “Drop on request!” to my seemingly disinterested instructor, bringing an end to the hope of becoming a Naval Aircrewman. Or… I can’t tell you much more. The only thing I clearly remember during one of my drownings—when I was strapped into one of the four seats in the back—was the voice of the device instructor: “Keep hold of a reference point then find another as you move, purposefully, toward the picture of the hatch in your mind where you know it is supposed to be. Reference point to reference point.” I also remember getting kicked in the face by another classmate making their way to the picture in their mind. I held on to the reference point, which I’m sure had a full imprint of my handwoven into the canvas seat. The initial impact of the Helo Dunker just before it rolls upside down as top-heavy helos do., USN Back on the bleachers, I was grateful that the air was once again hot and humid and that the pool water, dripping from my Cherry Red Helmet down across my face, made the tears hard to distinguish, should anyone have looked. I happily admit that several of the water qualification evolutions were great fun: the parachute drag, the poolside winching up into a simulated helicopter, intense rotor downwash included, and the zip-line ride into the water after a simulated ejection followed by the truly hilarious struggle to board a one-man life raft in full flight gear and, if you forgot to properly detach it from the seat-pan in the ejection seat. Then, it was out to the bay and real water where we fired off our Mk 31 pencil and Mk 13 signal flares. We also practiced boarding larger life rafts carried by patrol aircraft or those dropped by USCG C-130s for survivor rescues. The most exciting moment came at the end of the day when we rode a whaleboat further out into the bay and the helo squadron assigned to SAR duties at NAS Pensacola came out to pick us up. What a blast it was to be winched up to a real, live, hovering Sea King helicopter! I had hoped it would turn out to be my first helo ride, and some classes did get to fly back to the airfield in her. However, we apparently had a too large a class and after the rescue swimmer let me hang outside the door for a moment, he slapped my helmet with a smile and back down I went. And just like that, it was over. From The Sea To The Swamp The final phase of training was Land Survival at Eglin, AFB, which was just a short bus ride east of Pensacola. Here we were joined by graduating Officer Candidate School (OCS) pilot and Naval Flight Officer (NFO) candidates. And once again, I was faced with the limitations of my childhood having only had a brief overnight stay in the Adirondack mountains when I was growing up. My outdoor skills were comparable to my ability to swim. Worse still, I was so damn tired during the initial land survival classroom phase that my stuporous state prevented me from absorbing the vital lectures explaining survival equipment and techniques. So, at one point during the adventure, I was handed the compass and instructed to take over land navigation for my entire class of officers and enlisted. Here was my chance to guide my fellow “downed” aviators to rescue and safety! Yeah…no. I held the compass in my hand following the needle as it pointed in the direction we were to go. That’s right, instead of doing it the right way and picking landmarks along the bearing line and navigating around obstacles in the path, I happily followed the wavering needle. Needless to say, after half an ignorant mile, a very angry instructor snatched the compass out of my hand just as I was leading my class to certain death in one of Eglin’s notorious, shadowy, alligator-occupied swamps. Amid echoes of bitter laughter and a few choice words rising through the autumn forest around me, I was certain I could see flashes of white teeth briefly glistening against well-camouflaged faces in said dark swamp—we had been told we would be sharing the woods with a class of U.S. Army officers and men slogging their way toward earning the coveted Ranger Tab. Yeah…no. It was more-than-likely a simple hallucination brought on by a mix of leftover catatonia from the classroom and a need for even more humiliation. Oh well, the class and I survived, and most importantly, a dragon had been slayed. Pensacola was, without a doubt, the most life-enhancing encounter I would experience during my time in the Navy. I could actually do this shit! Kevin’s Aircrew class. He’s standing in the second row, on the left side of one of the first female Aircrew Candidates. The guys in red t-shirts are Marine Corps Aircrew. Kevin’s “Helo Dunker DOR” instructor is on my row under USN Flag., Kevin Noonan One final Pensacola note: toward the end of my time there, I was informed by a disinterested and ill-informed “career counselor” that there was a good chance I would be selected to continue on to Rescue Swimmer School due to the needs of the USN and USNR as there was a critical shortage of helo AWs. Yeah…NO! Had I had my cherry red helmet in hand, I would have placed it gently on his desk and using today’s texting parlance would have written, in a bold hand: “ROFL!” on his forehead. The next step in my adventure led me to Aviation Anti-Submarine Warfare “A” School in Millington, Tennessee. Whereas Pensacola was a trial of the body, AW “A” School would be a trial of the mind. Alien Language Millington was a well-worn town with a well-worn naval base. The barracks and school buildings spoke of decades of sailors passing through on their way to the variety of aviation ratings. The only difference between the unassuming building I would be mustering at and most others was the need to have a security clearance to get in. Here we would be introduced to the full intellectual weight of what it meant to be an AW. We were instructed in very basic courses on Radar, Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD), Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) weapons by instructors who had served in P-2s, P-3s, S-2s, S-3s, ASW Modules (ASMODs) aboard carriers, and the larger land-based ASW Operations Center (ASWOC). They would attempt to introduce us to the craft of hunting the elusive submarine. After these initial classes, we then delved into the ‘meat and potatoes’ subjects learning how submarine machinery worked and how the propulsion and equipment transmitted sounds into the ocean. Next came oceanography, or “Ocean O” as we called it. It was a difficult class, but I could finally see just how the ocean worked to increase or decrease our chance of finding a submarine. I was very grateful we weren’t confronted with too much of the math usually associated with oceanography. To me, fractions and equations were almost as terrifying as the Helo Dunker. A startling aspect of this phase of training, one causing a bit of cognitive dissonance, came when I heard the voice of Casey Kasem on a series of classified videos describing everything from the function of a diesel submarine’s ballast tanks to the path a particular machinery sound source took during a certain time of day to cross the ocean. I was used to hearing him every Saturday morning on American Top 40 telling stories of how Stevie Nicks met Mick Fleetwood, or the critical role Linda Ronstadt had in the success of Don Henley and the Eagles. It actually made this portion of the training that much more enjoyable. During the next phase, we would become acquainted with something called LOFAR gram analysis and interpretation. I can only describe it as learning an entirely new language that had no relationship or comparison to any articulation made by human beings. It was purely alien . My mind was reeling. I came away from each day’s class with a headache and a thousand-mile stare. I could not grasp how lines and shading and white space on a texturally strange piece of paper could be a rainstorm, a merchant ship, a pod of whales, or a submarine. It is well understood by those who do ASW that hunting submarines tends to be more art than science. This is true, to an even greater extent, when learning how to use the tools of the trade. I was being told that what I was seeing was very logical and scientific and it was. Yet my mind could not create a bridge to cross the chasm between what my instructors were telling me and what my eyes were actually seeing. In order to really see it, to really comprehend and bridge the chasm, my right brain would have to play a greater role than my left. LOFAR, or “LOw-Frequency Analysis and Recording,” came to undersea warfare as a result of desperation and industrial curiosity. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of ASW conferences exposed just how weak and ill-prepared Allied navies were to handle what the snorkel, the creation of the Type XXI U-boat, and post-war Soviet design brought to the submarine. Far worse, the fast-approaching adaptation of nuclear propulsion to the hull of an undersea craft would render post-war “hunter-killer” ASW methods and sensors obsolete since the submarine could simply vanish. Some of these conferences were held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and were attended by members of industry, such as Bell Labs. At Bell Labs, it just so happened that engineers and scientists were trying to figure out a way to enhance the human voice to ensure that long-distance and trans-Atlantic phone calls would be clear and comprehensible. These brilliant souls discovered that a low-frequency analyzer would place discrete lines of information on heat-sensitive carbon-based paper, providing “a graphic sketch of the acoustic signals in black, white, and grey, offering an image of aural reality…” wrote Gary Weir, a historian at the U.S. Naval Historical Center, in an exceptional paper on the history of Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). The LOFAR gram: Black lines, gray shading, and white space representing sound created on burnt carbon-based paper., Public Domain On May 2, 1951, the U.S. Navy was handed a gift—a new, complex method to prevent the nuclear submarine from vanishing. If a voice could create visible images on paper, a noisy submarine could do so, as well. As Weir describes: “If any part of the boat moved, pumped, or circulated, the resulting sound radiated into the ocean and formed part of the trail that enabled the system to find the submarine and track it.” But it would take time, years in fact, for the SOSUS operators, sonar techs, and airborne sensor operators, to really appreciate what Bell Labs had given them. The LOFAR gram offered so much more than simple lines on paper. Weir continues: “Embedded within the many varied graphic images, operators found themselves able to discern subtle nuances in sound signals via intensity, color, shape, and shade that often made the difference between seeing a school of fish or a submarine… Operators looked beyond the data, the physics, and the engineering, to the ways the LOFAR trace betrayed the personality and attitude of the detected signal that very often revealed its nature… Some signals appeared in such a regular and familiar way that, after initial detection, future identification did not present a problem. These visual patterns became the much-vaunted “signatures” which betrayed particular targets or classes of targets.” While I hadn’t taken piano or violin lessons as a kid, I did have a deep affection for and intangible connection to art in general and music, in particular. And while my instructors were really good teachers, I had to take what they were telling me and essentially let the right brain silence the left and see the nuances brought on by the shading and colors and then trust that what I was being told about sources was true. Dr. Weir expresses what operators through the years came to understand: “The nature of the task and the acoustic imaging techniques employed by LOFAR made a well-trained and intellectually able operator with an artistic eye a necessity.” As my time at “A” School was nearing an end, I slowly and unwittingly began to cross that chasm. I gradually began to understand the nature of sound, of harmonics, and comprehend how the black lines, gray shading, and white space sound created on burnt carbon-based paper could be a rainstorm, a merchant ship, a pod of whales, or a submarine. Studying Orion Once I finished AW “A” School, I was off to a town in Pennsylvania I’d never heard of, and a Naval Air Station I never knew existed. Horsham is a small township just north of Philadelphia and was home to NAS Willow Grove (now a Joint Reserve Base) which trained aviation components of the NAVRES, particularly the future crew members of P-3 Orion aircraft, and was the home field for VP-64 Condors , a P-3B Reserve squadron (“VP” being the USN’s designation for fixed-wing, patrol). Here, instead of slides, movies, and naval teaching manuals showing pictures of radar scopes and LOFAR grams, I would finally get to put my hands on the actual primary hardware an Orion Sensor Operator used to hunt submarines: the AN/APS-80 radar, the AN/AQA-7 LOFAR “gram machine,” and the AN/AAS-36 Infrared Detection System (IRDS). Learning about and then operating the radar and acoustic processor in a training simulator that provided “actual” contacts was a highly motivating experience. I began to realize that all the reading, the dreaming and the imagining I had done from childhood was slowly transitioning into a reality. I couldn’t wait to start getting flight time in an actual aircraft hunting actual submarines. Well, actually, I would have a relatively long wait for my first flight in a submarine hunter and it would be a very long two-year wait for my first hunt of an actual submarine. This, despite a flight line full of P-3Bs just a stone’s throw away. Hell, not only would I not get any flight time, I wouldn’t even get to climb inside one of VP-64’s aircraft. It just wasn’t part of this training syllabus. After training in Pennsylvania, I joined my regional NAVRES squadron—the “Crawfishers” of VP-94 stationed at NAS New Orleans for the required orientation and training in the aircraft.  Once I finished all of my active duty training, I would return to my childhood home in Texas. I could have simply chosen NAS Dallas, the closest NAVRES base to my home, but I didn’t want to allow my AW skills to go to waste and I sure as hell didn’t want to spend my reserve weekends cleaning endless buildings, listening to endless lectures, or standing endless (and irrelevant) watches. Crawfisher P-3B., San Diego Air and Space Museum What was really cool about joining VP-94 was that their P-3s would fly across several of lower southern states on the Friday of the requisite one-weekend-a-month and pick up reservists who were members of their squadron.  Granted, I would still have to clean squadron spaces, listen to lectures, and stand a watch or two, but they’d all be relevant to my newly minted, part-time AW life. Far more important to me, I would gain flight, mission, and classroom hours toward earning my wings. Wheels Up! Finally…FINALLY! I was about to take to the skies on my first fixed-wing naval aircraft: the Orion, the legendary hunter of submarines. I would be under the tutelage of a great division AWC for this first hop (I wish I could remember his name and had taken a camera with me). After an instructional preflight, I donned my helmet, SV-2, rolled down my flight suit sleeves and put my flight gloves on. I strapped myself into the Sensor 2 station seat and rotated to face the tail of the airplane all in accordance with P-3A & B NATOPS safety procedures.  I was ready and eagerly absorbed all the sounds, smells and intercom chatter as we started two and then the remaining two engines and taxied to the active runway. We lifted off from NAS New Orleans, climbed and turned on a northward heading to Illinois and then to NAS Jacksonville on some sort of logistics flight. Both legs of the mission would keep us over land so we wouldn’t get a chance to drop buoys and operate the AQA-7.  However, my chief made sure I would get to sit at the jealously-coveted Sensor 3 station and work the APS-80 radar and the IRDS (Infra-Red Detection System, basically a FLIR system). Meanwhile, my first task was to complete a critical duty performed on every P-3 Orion that has ever slipped the surly bonds of Earth: inspect each avionics “closet” that lined the forward right section of the crew tunnel enclosing most of the mission black boxes for smoke, sparks, or fire. With the pilot’s permission, I replaced my helmet with a set of headphones equipped with a boom mic and a long ICS (InterCom System) chord that would allow me to talk to the crew while moving about the tunnel.  I wasn’t even aware that I was climbing the few steps forward to the first closet. With my AWC hovering above my left shoulder, I began the inspection placing the back of my flight-gloved hand against the door and felt for heat. I then opened it cautiously and sniffed the air now filled with electrons and sounds emanating from boxes whose names and functions I had started to learn at NAS Willow Grove and would have to know intimately if I was going to earn my wings. With no evidence of sparks or fire, I closed the first closet and moved slightly aft to inspect the next one. For the first time, I noticed the steep incline of the flight deck as the Orion climbed to cruising altitude.  I had to catch myself, ensuring I wouldn’t tumble down toward the aft end of the aircraft. AWC said nothing but his ear-to-ear smile confirmed what every newbie aircrew member had to understand about flying inside a P-3:  she loved to “dance the skies on laughter-silvered wings.” I inspected each additional closet for signs of sparks or fire. Once I had completed checking every rack, I reported “all secure” to the pilot and settled in for the flight northward. The ride north was uneventful, but I had an absolute blast running the radar and was captivated seeing FLIR imagery for the first time in my life. It was intriguing to see actual radar returns from the land, large structures, and weather. We landed at a civilian airport somewhere in Illinois, completed some logistical task and, having refueled, started the engines up for the flight to NAS Jacksonville. P-3B Sensor 3 station with APS-80 scope. , AW1 Tim’s Blog On this launch, I was invited up into the cockpit to sit behind the pilot on the radar cabinet. Oh…my…God! For the first time in my life, I would get to be in the midst of military pilots flipping switches, manipulating levers and bantering their way through start-up and takeoff checklists. All the dreams and imaginings sparked by books, movies, and airshows had finally come together in this moment. We taxied to the active runway and I eagerly listened as the tower gave us clearance for takeoff, climb-out instructions, and the frequency switch to departure. With a nod from the pilot, the Flight Engineer pushed the throttles forward and the four Allison T56 instantly responded pulling the air across the Orion’s stubby wings. The pilot released the brakes and we began a roll that quickly translated into speed. And then, just like that, we were airborne. Music. Where was the music ?!  There wasn’t any music! I had been a child of classic military aviation movies that played on one of the three major television networks once a year. When a B-36, or a B-17, or a formation of F-86s lifted into the air, they were always accompanied by an orchestra striking up a dramatic melody.  Yet, here I was, in the cockpit of the mighty P-3 Orion climbing away from the earth and there wasn’t a single octave of music, not even an eighth or a sixteenth of a note!  Just the sound of the wheels coming up into their wells, the high tonal hum of four responsive turboprop engines, and the co-pilot calling back to the tube asking the Chief to bring up three cups of coffee. Once back at NAS New Orleans, reality set in. Things moved at an excruciatingly slow pace compared to the active Navy, and that was the way the Reserves liked it.  It was clear we weren’t going to be flying any missions out into the Gulf of Mexico while I was there doing my orientation. Any hope I had for time-on-top of a submarine essentially vanished when I learned that the more senior operators and the TARs (Training and Administrative Reserves, the guys and gals who ran VP-94 Tuesday through Sunday), would get the choice billets when the squadron deployed for the long  two-week summer of “active duty” to exciting places like Iceland or Spain. P-3B Orion aircraft of Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6) “The World Famous Blue Sharks” in-flight near Oahu, Hawaii., USN I began to wonder if this had been the right decision.  I took a walk one night down to the airfield. The sun had just set and the early spring air was unusually cool for the normally sweltering Louisiana delta. There was no wind and only the blue lights marking the taxiways and the flashing signal from the base water tower lit the dusk. No engines turning, no fuel trucks moving, no maintenance personnel yelling for another wrench. I had never been on an airfield at a time like this where the silence permeated everything in a way that was almost sacred. No, it actually was sacred. Amid this loud silence, I meditated over where I had been and where I wanted to go. My soon return to civilian life promised a 9-to-5 job power-sanding wood furniture in a small strip mall store. I was only 19 and here I was dreading the fact that my only salvation from the normalcy of civilian life was a rather benign one-weekend-a-month in New Orleans hoping and praying I’d get a few hours of flight time. I simply couldn’t shake the dreamer in me and the possibilities of being in the thick of things that active-duty life promised. While the offerings of fleet VP squadrons had definite advantages, my brother’s tales of flying off a carrier in the S-3 haunted my contemplation. I spoke with the Chief the next day. He absolutely understood and had me call the AW Detailer at the Pentagon that afternoon. I asked if they needed any S-3 SENSOs in the fleet. They did.  My Chief said: “Let’s get the paperwork started!” He was such a great leader. It would take time. I made two or three more visits to VP-94 over the next few months between sanding chairs and bookshelves. The anticipation built and then the day came with the arrival of my orders to active-duty: Report to Fleet Replacement Squadron, AirAntisubron 41 VIA Recruit Training Center, Orlando, Florida VIA FASOTRAGRUPAC, NAS North Island, San Diego I was on my way. Calm Before The Storm That first “VIA” on my orders caught me a little off guard. I didn’t realize that I would have to go back to a Recruit Training Command (RTC) having just completed 8 weeks of bootcamp the previous year. But, the Navy, in all its wisdom, demands that all Reservists going back to active-duty be reminded how to properly salute and wear their Dixie cup in a sharp, Navy fashion. It was actually a fun couple of weeks. They made sure I had all my shots and my seabag was filled with all the regulation uniforms and my underwear was stenciled properly. And then I was off to lovely southern California where I checked in with Fleet Aviation Specialized Operational Training Group Pacific. Since North Island had evolved into a Naval Air Station that primarily housed sea-based ASW aircraft such as the S-3 Viking, the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite, and the brand-new, Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk, FASOTRAGRUPAC’s had a primary mission that focused on the aircrew and missions those aircraft flew. This meant ASW, baby! Here, nestled among enlisted barracks, senior officer housing, and buildings and hangars lining the eastern side of the airfield, FASO trained newly minted officer and enlisted aircrew in the basics of anti-submarine warfare, including tactics, operations, and for the fixed-wing and helo AW, a deeper dive into tactical oceanography and far more detailed acoustic training covering all classes of Allied and Soviet submarines. Of course, I loved anything submarine. Learning the finer points of the tactical ASW ocean environment and the noises produced by submarines opened the door to a fuller understanding of just how important my job as a SENSO in the Viking would be (well, at least in theory…I would have to face the stark reality of the weight of responsibility in real-time during my first Med cruise the following year). What was even more invaluable were the “war stories” my instructors told about their recent past on the front lines of ASW.  Again, we had AWs who had flown in every helo and fixed-wing aircraft type and their tales of actual time-on-top of Soviet submarines brought everything together. As you move through life, certain days of historical significance mark the time. One such day during my FASO training did just that. It was an unusually cold winter morning and we had just started a class on the particulars of Soviet submarine diesel engines. Around 0845, another instructor, sullen-faced, interrupted the lecture and told us to join him in the instructor’s office.  We filed in among those already crowding a small television screen. It was January 28, 1986. On the screen, in a seemingly constant replay, I could just make out a billowing cloud of upward climbing smoke and what appeared to be an explosion. The Space Shuttle Challenger had, moments before, disintegrated during her launch from Cape Canaveral. Of course, I didn’t know it then, but a few years later, I would be doing range clearance for another Shuttle launch in my Fleet squadron S-3 at the northern limit of the warning area that covered the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Captured Behind Friendly Lines As my time at FASOTRAGRUPAC was coming to its end, and before I could find my way into that coveted Viking SENSO seat I had been longing to climb into, I would have to go to one final school. FASO was also responsible for sending all of its aircrew students to an immensely important training evolution that attempted to prepare them in the event they were shot down over enemy territory. For me, it would be yet another of life’s dragons. After 24 hours in a desert survival environment, that culminated under a sky of stars so immense that it made the surrounding terrain seem like perpetual twilight, we headed to a wintry mountainous area northeast of San Diego known as Warner Springs. There, FASO conducted Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape (SERE) school. Along with my class of AWs, we were joined by the officers from FASO and other individuals who required the training. Among those individuals were three or four gentlemen who had completed their SEAL training and were getting their SERE check-in-the-box. They were led by a young officer who had an engaging personality and had us and the instructors laughing. At one point, we learned that larger groups of SEALs had historically been sent through SERE together at one time. However, this practice was ended when a routine began to take shape in the form of the team taking over the prison camp and, in some cases, inviting the instructors to experience the same maltreatment levied against the students. If memory serves, there was an interesting debate whether this young SEAL officer was senior to one of the aviators, requiring one of them to take the role of Senior Ranking Officer (SRO). I think the SEAL was senior, but declined SRO because he wanted to remain independent of the group to escape, and far more interesting things of that nature. I also remember another debate about footwear: the SEALs had shown up in boots they preferred to wear in combat and they were concerned that the camp guards would recognize them for who they were based on the boots. As a group, we had agreed upon a common story that we were passengers in C-141 that had been shot down—now that I think about it, there weren’t any USAF folks among us so that story probably didn’t sell well at the Warner Springs Department of Interrogation and Torture. The classroom instructor assured the LT he had nothing to worry about. For me, the first days of Survival and Evasion started out okay, but that took an abrupt turn when the time of evasion was coming to an end. The speeding trucks, the firing off of AK-47 rounds, the yelling and the loudspeakers all set the stage for a very realistic and troubling experience. Both me and the officer I had teamed up with had grown weary from lack of food and our diminishing water supply after two full days of this part of the camping trip. In our now filthy, dilapidated flight suits, we stumbled across a road that we thought was clear. Yeah…no. An enemy Security Force truck was sitting there in plain sight. Neither one of us saw it. Weary arms and hands went up above our heads. We were bound and forced into the bed of the pickup. It was only a week-long training evolution, but the days of resistance and escape would last for what felt like a month. Surprisingly, I did fairly well with the waterboarding—it was the repeated slamming of my body up against the wall with an enemy guard screaming an amazing level of anger, spittle and epithets in my face that was most difficult for me. Being held in what I think was something like an enclosed concrete cinder block was also unnerving. I wasn’t claustrophobic, but the inside was too small to sit up straight. It was also definitely too small to lie down in. They played a constant stream of white noise, preached sunny sermons from The Very Best of Marx and Lenin or made generous Public Service Announcements of our soon and pending death. As night fell, the concrete walls radiated the freezing California air quite efficiently. Then they came for me. A scene from modern-day SERE school., USAF By this time, I had passed into what Rod Serling liked to call the Twilight Zone . I wasn’t exactly 100 percent sure at times that I hadn’t been shot down and I was actually in a POW camp somewhere. I was pushed into a room with a nice gentleman sitting at a desk who offered me a hot drink and some food. He had an “International Red Cross” armband on and told me if I would just sign this confession, I and my fellow POWs would be treated much better. For the first time, I looked into his eyes and then I fell back into my chair, snapping back into reality. I recognized who this was sitting across the desk from me. I had seen his face in one of the films we had watched as part of the classroom training for this evolution. I had the honor of being soft-cell interrogated by a genuine hero of the Vietnam War: Doug Hegdahl . Tragically, while serving aboard the USS Canberra (CA-70) during a naval fire-support mission in the Gulf of Tonkin, Doug had been blown overboard by a shockwave from one of the cruiser’s 5-inch gun mounts. He was picked up by Cambodian fishermen, but was later captured by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and interned at the Hanoi Hilton. His story is truly remarkable. Because he wasn’t considered much of an intelligence source or a threat to the NVA, he was allowed free reign around the camp. During this time, he began to memorize over 200 names and stories of his fellow POWs. When the NVA offered an early release, Doug was ordered by the SRO to take it so he could divulge the names and the horrific conditions faced by the men there in Hanoi. I don’t remember much of that night after my session with Doug. I do remember, quite vividly, the events of the following morning, however. Inside my concrete cocoon, I was awoken by screams, pounding of feet and gunfire that shattered the otherwise freezing morning air. Yep…the damn SEALs had escaped. A few hours later, they were required to surrender. Yeah, I seem to recall clear loudspeaker instructions reminding them that they had to come back to the camp and finish the course.  (There was a definite Please, Guys…come on…you have to plea in the announcer’s voice!). Gotta love the damn SEALs! More time passed and I had no idea what day it was, but another afternoon or another morning came and went and our captors called us to quarters for another round of verbal abuse when more gunfire broke out.  We all scattered for cover. Then…our instructors mysteriously disappeared. Overhead, it sounded like a helicopter of some sort passed with guns blazing. Someone came running into camp with an American flag streaming from his hands. He went to the flag pole that had a Soviet flag flying and pulled it down. He attached the Stars and Stripes to it and raised it high above our heads as we gathered back around. It was then, over the loudspeaker, that the Star Spangled Banner began to play… …and a dozen or so grown men began to sob. Obviously, the nature of the training was unsurpassed in importance.  The experience and lessons learned would stay with me throughout my time in the Navy. Also, I learned more about myself during that week and in the days of self-reflection that followed. I wasn’t pleased with my performance because I encountered far too many weaknesses. But it was done.  Another dragon was sorta-kinda slayed. The bus ride back to North Island was quite remarkable. We left the Naval Air Station a week prior in a Navy bus (a school bus painted haze gray) and we returned in a chartered luxury bus (of Greyhound quality). Hey, sometimes the ol’ Navy took care of its own! Finally, it was time to enter into the world of the S-3 Viking. But before I describe the training required to become a “Tailhook SENSO” (as we called ourselves), allow me to compare and contrast the P-3 with the S-3. Related But Not The Same: The Unique Worlds Of The P-3 Orion And S-3 Viking Aside from the obvious cosmetic differences of such things as the number of engines and motive power used by the two aircraft, or the fixed presence of the Orion’s “stinger” MAD (Magnetic Anomaly Detector) boom as opposed to the retractable one carried by the Viking, we flew our common missions differently because we each came from decidedly different communities and mission philosophies.  These remarkable distinctions can be attributed to another cosmetic disparity: only one of the two aircraft had a tailhook. Let me explain: The historical experiences of the VP Navy contributed to the evolution of a very well developed, disciplined, and highly motivated community philosophy unique within USN. In many ways looking like the USAF’s Strategic Air Command, they became an air force within NAVAIR. The nature of their consistent mission, fully established in combat during WWII and sustained during the years of the Cold War, allowed them to maintain separation from the burgeoning and then dominate carrier-based naval aviation. An S-3 Viking and a JMSDF P-3 Orion fly in formation., USN Moving from their flying boat origins and eventual obsolescence, their dry feet demanded the establishment of unique operations, bases, and logistics exclusive from the Navy they were a part of. They were also savvy enough to read the fiscal and political writing on the wall and made their own inroads throughout Washington D.C. As a result of this distinction and the type of aircraft flown, they developed their own philosophy on how to approach ASW which tended to be a more strategic form than the tactical form flown from the aircraft carrier. Strategic ASW came into focus with the rising Soviet ballistic missile submarine threat. The VP community had legs. They were based in permanent areas, such as Iceland and Scotland, which allowed easy access to the Barents Sea and the GIUK gap that were the natural choke points Soviet submarines had to pass through to arrive at their patrol areas in the Atlantic.  The maritime patrol aircraft (MPAs) expended relatively little fuel getting there and they could carry larger sonobuoy loads and seed the needed large search patterns to regain contact or localize and track what SOSUS had already detected. In contrast, the VS community was part of a larger whole: the carrier Air Wing. The commander of the Air Wing was usually a fighter or attack guy by birth, initially a senior commander, but was eventually changed to a captain to respectfully stand toe-to-toe with the carrier’s skipper when needed. S-3 with MAD and refuelng probe extended., USN The COs of S-2 and S-3 squadrons were mere commanders. The admiral and staff in charge of the CVBG were fighter/attack-oriented, so what the Air Wing/carrier needed or wanted to fulfill its strike missions was everyone’s priority. ASW, despite its critical contribution to the survival of the carrier amid the growing Soviet anti-carrier submarine threat, was only a supporting role in the non-ASW mind’s eye. Even during the heady days of the anti-submarine carrier groups of the ‘50s and ‘60s, the CVS (anti-submarine carrier) was essentially subordinate to and protective of the attack carrier battlegroups. Besides, the job of the ASW aircraft aboard the carriers and escorts was to find and attack any and all submarines with the hope of killing them while the carrier made good her escape. By the nature of this form of ASW and our place within the Air Wing, the VS philosophy was considerably different from that of VP. The VP communities’ political strength was legendary, despite not having a Curtiss LeMay at the helm like Strategic Air Command. When the P-2s and P-3s needed something, they usually got it. When questions of getting the necessary updates to airframes to meet the Soviet naval threat or the need arose to arm the Orion with the Harpoon and even the Sidewinder , they played political ball. US Navy P-3 equipped with AGM-84 Harpoons, AIM-9 Sidewinders, and iron bombs (all training rounds)., USN An even stronger argument for their ingenious skill can be seen at the end of the Cold War when the Viking first lost her ASW equipment and SENSO in 2000, and then lost her place in the fleet entirely nine years later. The P-3 flew on with all of her ASW gear and became an invaluable asset for the Global War on Terrorism by doing ISR over land !  More importantly, she was ready for the return of Cold War 2.0, which we have since waded into. I’ve said this before, the P-3 Sensor Operators (and their foreign MPA counterparts) have always been masters of airborne ASW.  When the S-3 community received one into their ranks, they immediately became the very best of the SENSOs. But a major contrast between the two communities’ sensor operators can be seen in the attributes of the Viking SENSO: unlike our P-3 brethren—or Sonar Techs aboard submarines or surface ships—we didn’t have an additional AW or senior AW to share the load and call upon once the wheels were in the well. We also didn’t have the space the P-3 Orion did, so no chance to carry reference publications and things to make the job easier (other than what you can stuff in your helmet bag)—in an aircraft carrier environment, any FOD in the cockpit can kill during a launch or landing. We had to store our information, knowledge, and confidence inside our skin each time we went flying. We were very much alone in making calls, such as classifying targets, and maintaining responsibility for those calls. It was a great place for a loner like me. It was also a terrifying place for a loner like me. Enter The Viking Hall After completing FASO, I walked a few blocks toward the end of Runway 29 at NAS North Island and stood at the security window of a non-descript, otherwise windowless building.  Behind the glass, a future S-3 AW who was standing watch asked me for my name while eyeing the security badge hanging from the left breast pocket of my USN working blues. He smiled. I heard a buzz from the unassuming security entrance door. I smiled too. I had arrived at the VS-41 Trainer Building (TB), which at the time, was the only place in the world where Lockheed S-3A pilots, TACCOs/COTACs and SENSOs were built. Inside this seemingly cavernous building, I would learn the very core of what it meant to be a sensor operator in the Viking. Down its passageways were a multitude of classrooms, instructor offices, and several full-size and fully operational Weapon Systems Trainers (WST) that were replicas of the TACCO and SENSO stations in the S-3. The pilots and COTACs would train in two fully operational and flight motion capable front cockpit flight simulators made by Link. In the classroom, we covered every box that resided at the SENSO station, every “black box” occupying the avionics tunnel related to our station and every multi-function button that lined the revolutionary INtegrated COntrol System (INCOS) tray which allowed the SENSO to operate all of the sensors contained within the Viking.  I loved learning and then thinking through the process of converting a system function to a tactical problem. I felt completely at home in the learning environment at VS-41. As we were taught the different systems, we then went into one of the WSTs with the instructor sitting in the TACCO seat or outside at the instructor console guiding us through the operation of each function. SENSO station MPD (lower screen) and Auxiliary Readout Unit (upper screen)., Lockheed As time progressed and we became proficient with system operation, we spent less time in the classroom and more time in the WST with student NFOs who were at a point in their training where we could begin to work as a team. This training philosophy was priceless. It was the first time I worked so closely with an officer and it allowed me as an enlisted man to understand the relationship we would have to have in the actual cockpit of the Viking. It also forced me to think outside the narrow focus of the functionality of my job in the aircraft by keeping the TACCO informed of what knowledge I was gathering from my sensors so he could develop and manipulate the tactical “big picture.” The WSTs were genuinely amazing creations. From rooms filled with computers came realistic ocean environments, sensor signals, and signatures—functions and mission profiles that real-world warships and aircraft were expected to present. We trained to identify, classify, and determine the location and intention of these signals. Our instructors could “break in” to the mostly pre-programmed scenarios and make the training more or less difficult, based on how well or poorly we were doing. As we progressed through the training, additional threats were added in the form of a second submarine or surface warships. Although the computer technology of the day did an incredible job of trying to create real-world conditions for us, nothing but the real-world would suffice.  The most important benefit of this training was the establishment of a great foundation of system knowledge and procedural performance and the absolute necessity of cockpit communication and coordination among the crew. But it wasn’t all about the job. Free time was very generous at the RAG (or Replacement Air Group, an older name for NAVAIR’s training commands). Arrival at VS-41 was our introduction into the Brown Shoe Navy; after all, our instructors had cut their teeth in the fleet. The atmosphere was very professional, but also laid back. The focus was on preparing us for the fleet, but not losing sight of the fact that we were human. My free time was occupied by standing watches, studying, or just getting off the base. Watches consisted of weekend security watch at the entrance to the TB or overnight flight line watch ensuring no Soviet commando had a chance to place a bomb in the wheel well of VS-41’s collection of S-3s. VS-41 flightline at NAS North Island in the 1980s. , USN Studying was a never-ending process. Most of our courses were classified so I ended up spending most of that free time back in the TB. But I did take time to walk around the base or sit at the end of the runway and watch the fleet squadron S-3s takeoff and land—something I loved to do back on Carswell AFB as a kid. I wasn’t a partier, but I did take the occasional opportunity to get off base and explore the Strand or the Hotel Del Coronado with my classmates. Of course, the movie Top Gun hit the theaters on May 12, 1986 and my fellow AWs and I made our requisite pilgrimage to the theater in downtown San Diego. In fact, we would spend most of the summer of ‘86 going to see it—I stopped counting after the 7th viewing. I didn’t care much for the storyline—I will always prefer The Final Countdown— or the pathetic use of F-5s for MiGs, but what I had to see over and over was the opening flight deck scene and all the Tomcat air-to-air scenes (yes, I’m one of those people that can listen to the same song a thousand times). Whatever the specific reasons for the multiple viewings, we soon-to-be Viking AWs knew we would be flying off similar flight decks with the movie’s featured fighter and that was motivation enough for our significant contribution to Top Gun ’s more than $358 million box-office windfall. You’re welcome, Mr. Cruise. The summer progressed and graduation was just around the corner. We continued to work hard in the classroom and the WS, but it was time for us to finally take everything we had learned into the air. First Viking Voyage Other classmates made their first flight already and came back to report their experiences. Most said they were too busy “doing it right” to really enjoy the first-time experience. One or two of them got airsick. My day finally came and I was very excited. I don’t remember much of the flight because of how much time I also spent trying to do it right, too. However, I wasn’t too busy not to get airsick.  Thankfully, the instructors made sure we carried an airsick bag. I needed two. I was mortified because we didn’t do any maneuvering that was extraordinary. I had assumed my handful of air-sick-free hours in the P-3 would ensure this wouldn’t happen to me. But I survived and was very pleased with my choice to go active duty and fly in the Viking. Finally, my time at VS-41 neared its end. All of the classroom and trainer time didn’t culminate in the air. Instead, it ended in a final practical exam that would take place in the WST that was linked up to the “flying” simulator down the passageway where a student pilot and COTAC would join me and a TACCO. The exam was a full combat mission that included cockpit and systems preflight,  launching procedures from the carrier, then flying out to the threat area to hunt for the one or two Soviet submarines looking to sink our carrier while working hard to avoid the reach of the surface-to-air missiles that would come from the Soviet Surface Action Group (SAG) intent on shooting us down. It was a complex, intense, and fantastic experience.  We all had our individual problems, but we found and sank the submarine. And with that I had passed my final hurtle and would now wait for my classmates to finish their final WST evolutions before we would all gather for graduation. VS-41 S-3 off the San Diego coast near the picturesque Del Coronado Hotel., USN Along with the obvious reward of completing a comprehensive, challenging, and satisfying naval aircraft training course, two other elements made our graduation such an incredible experience. On Aug. 8, 1986, my fellow Viking SENSOs and I had our Naval Aircrewman wings of gold pinned to our chests. Although we only had a few hours in the S-3, NAVAIR decided the Viking AW would get his wings upon the successful completion of the RAG syllabus. If memory serves, there was some controversy within the fleet about this practice.  Apparently, many felt that more time-in-aircraft and time-in-fleet should have been the standard. Oddly enough, not a single one of us complained! Along with receiving the beautiful chest decoration, each member of the class got to pick a fleet squadron from what AW billets were currently available, based on their final grades. I was honored to get first pick and it was a very difficult choice between some great squadrons, great aircraft carriers, and two distinctly different US Navies:  Just across the flight line at NAS North Island was the “Dragonfires” of VS-29 aboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) or VS-38 “Red Griffins” aboard the USS Ranger (CV-61). On the East Coast at NAS Cecil Field there were three choices available: VS-31 “Topcats” aboard the USS Eisenhower (CVN-69), VS-32 “Maulers” aboard the USS America (CV-66), or VS-24 “Scouts” aboard the USS Nimitz (CVN-68). I decided on the Scouts for several reasons. First off, they had an outstanding reputation on both coasts. I also didn’t want to serve aboard a “coal-burning” aircraft carrier. The squadron, part of Air Wing 8, was about to deploy to the Mediterranean soon after I arrived and I wanted to get right into the action. VS-24 offered the best opportunity for that. Finally, my brother had just left a very successful tour with VS-29 and, though I ultimately followed his footsteps into the S-3, I still needed to have my own unique experiences in a Navy different than the one he had served in. Orders in hand, I said “so long” to NAS North Island not knowing that I would land here in one of ten Vikings with my chosen squadron in less than a year. I would miss this group of incredible instructors who guided me through a mountain of information and prepared me to be the very best SENSO I could be. I would miss sharing a classroom with this tremendous group of fellow students. Fortunately, I only had to say goodbye to half of my class, the ones that chose the West Coast squadrons. I would see the other half in our shared squadron spaces at Cecil Field in the years to come. Though we had learned, trained, and prepared to be an individual in a four-seat combat aircraft that essentially had a very singular mission against a target that tended to act alone, I felt a part of a team for the first time in my life. I left VS-41 with a heavy, but happy and somewhat naive heart. I arrived at the Scouts ’ doorstep full of piss and vinegar, certain I had achieved lasting greatness due to how well I did at the RAG. I would be a magnificent asset to the squadron ensuring that with my knowledge and wisdom we would sink Soviet submarines left and right during the coming cruise (regardless of a declaration of war).  Very, and I mean very , quickly, I realized I had joined an aircrew shop manned by a seasoned AWC, two AW1s, and a generous collection of AW2s and AW3s who were incredibly well-versed procedurally in the extraction and bottling of piss and vinegar and the disassembly thereof. VS-24 S-3As circa 1986., USN With equal swiftness, I would also be faced with a strong dose of reality as a result of my first flight with VS-24. When I walked out to aircraft 704 that late September morning, there would be no Aircrew instructor, no fellow AW, no familiar face joining me. As I strapped myself in amid the deafening whine of the APU, the officers finishing their pre-start checks and the wail made by the start of our #1 TF-34 turbofan engine as it sucked in gobs and gobs of the cool Florida air, I realized something: I was completely alone.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Aug 11, 2020",B-2 Bombers Practice Stealth Team Tactics With F-35 Pilot Trainees For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed details of an exercise involving ten F-35A Lightning II fighters working alongside a pair of B-2 Spirits . It marked the first time that the stealth bombers have teamed up with Joint Strike Fighters from the training establishment at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. During the mission, the stealth team fought its way through simulated enemy air defense threats, with the F-35s dropping weapons in the process. The maneuvers exposed F-35 student pilots to real B-2s, rather than the virtual simulations that have been used to represent the bombers in training up till now. Known as Panther Capstone, the joint training mission brought together F-35As from the 63rd Fighter Squadron “Panthers” at Luke Air Force Base, and two B-2s assigned to the 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The F-35 pilots comprised six instructors and four students preparing to graduate. Although the training event took place on November 18, 2020, details have only been released now . An F-35A assigned to the 63rd Fighter Squadron takes off from Luke Air Force Base on November 18, 2020, during Panther Capstone., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Franklin R. Ramos “This was a first-time event for Whiteman’s B-2s integrating with Luke’s F-35s,” said Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Diller, 509th Bomb Wing program manager, and B-2 pilot. “As the number of F-35s increase , the understanding and interoperability between the various platforms must increase. What better way to facilitate this than at the capstone event at the F-35 schoolhouse?” The 63rd Fighter Squadron mission is to train U.S. Air Force student pilots on the F-35A and, although part of a six-nation F-35 schoolhouse enterprise at Luke, the unit only provides its basic course, or B-course, syllabus to U.S. Air Force candidates. The eight-month B-course teaches F-35 lead-in graduates everything from how to take off, navigate and land the jet, to flying air defense missions and attacking ground targets. It is then followed by mission qualification training with an operational F-35 unit. The move to add live training with the B-2 to the finale of the F-35A B-course syllabus reflects Air Force plans to have the two low-observable (LO), or stealthy, assets work together in contested airspace — using their respective attributes to defeat the air defenses of a potential peer or near-peer enemy. A U.S. Air Force F-35A pilot fastens his helmet prior to taxiing at Luke Air Force Base., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Franklin R. Ramos With that in mind, Panther Capstone involved an offensive counter-air mission, with the F-35s and B-2s flying as an attacking team that took on “multiple advanced adversary air and surface-to-air missile threats,” according to an Air Force press release. It was not revealed whether any live Red Air threats were present in the form of Air Force or contractor-operated aggressor jets. The F-35s dropped weapons during the mission, “to soften the target areas for the B-2s,” according to the Air Force. F-35 student pilots are required to drop inert munitions as part of their B-course. During the training mission, they also “pressured enemy air defenses,” which is a key role for the Joint Strike Fighter, and escorted the bombers to deter enemy aircraft. Pre-flight inspection for a fully armed 63rd Fighter Squadron F-35A at Luke Air Force Base earlier this year. , U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt. Alexander Cook “The F-35 was built to be able to escort low-observable assets like the B-2 into highly defended territory in order for them to be able to hold targets at risk,” explained Captain Sean Gossner, a 63rd Fighter Squadron instructor pilot and flight commander. “We finally got to practice this with real B-2s for the first time at Luke Air Force Base with the Panthers.” “Typically, we train for LO escort by using simulated assets that are not actually airborne with us, which leads to various training limitations,” Gossner continued. “To be able to bring together everything with 10 F-35s and two B-2s against a robust air threat picture and surface-to-air missile threat picture was incredible training for us.” While synthetic training, either in simulators or in embedded virtual-constructive training scenarios , is becoming an ever-more powerful and important tool, this is counterbalanced by the limitations inherent in non-live flying: in particular, the lack of adrenaline or “fear factor” inherent in real-world scenarios. Introducing real B-2s to a B-course mission addresses this, but also provides useful training for the stealth bomber crews, too. A B-2 Spirit takes off from Whiteman Air Force Base during a previous exercise. Whiteman is the only operational base for the B-2., U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Bryan Crane As well as integrating with the B-2s in the air during Panther Capstone, the 63rd Fighter Squadron pilots took part in mission planning with the B-2 crews at Whiteman Air Force Base, helping figure out the best way to deal with threats and other tactical problems, for an added layer of realism, reflecting how composite air operations would be planned on the front line. Gossner added that the 63rd Fighter Squadron is the only F-35 unit at Luke “with the ability to integrate with the B-2 in this capacity,” suggesting that training alongside the secretive stealth bomber is not an option available to the foreign-manned units at the base. How the F-35s and B-2s actually communicated with each other during the mission is unclear, but the ability, or lack of, to align stealthy data links is also a matter of growing concern for the U.S. military, reflected in recent experiments involving the XQ-58 drone an “airborne translator” between the F-22A Raptor and F-35, which you can read about here. The F-35 uses the stealthy Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL), while both the F-35 and the B-2 have Link 16 connectivity, although it is not stealthy and can compromise the aircraft’s cloak when used in a two-way, non-receive only manner. The Air Force plans to integrate the MADL onto the B-2, but it is unclear how far these efforts have progressed. Three F-35As from the 63rd Fighter Squadron hold formation during a refueling mission last year., U.S. Air Force/Airman Brooke Moeder The training mission also reflects a broader desire within the Air Force to bring together different stealthy aircraft as it seeks to further enhance the kinds of high-end capabilities that would be needed to penetrate into denied areas, as well as suppression and destruction of advanced enemy air defenses . Earlier this year, examples of the F-35A, F-22, B-2, and the ultra-secretive RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone , basically the USAF’s disclosed stealth force, all took part in the so-called Large Force Test Event (LFTE) at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. You can read all about that effort in this previous War Zone feature. As for the four B-course pilots who will hopefully graduate after Panther Capstone, they will arrive with their operational units having benefited from the type of high-end training that only live flying can provide. Working alongside a unique strategic asset like the B-2 will undoubtedly help prepare them for integration with other stealth platforms and the Air Force has confirmed its aspiration to run similar training events for its F-35 pilots in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At least 26 people have died and more than 50 have been wounded in a high-profile attack on Yemen’s Aden International Airport today. Multiple projectiles struck various parts of the facility just as members of a new Saudi Arabia-backed power-sharing government were disembarking from their plane shortly after touching down in the country. Yemeni and Saudi officials have accused Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the country of carrying out the attack. The Houthis, who have been fighting against a Saudi-led coalition for years now and have an expansive arsenal of missiles and suicide drones , as well as other indirect fire weapons, have denied responsibility . A still frame from a live broadcast from Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya television network showing an explosion as a projectile hits Aden International Airport in Yemen on Dec. 30, 2020., Al Arabiya capture The arrival of the cabinet ministers onboard a Yemenia airlines Airbus A320 flying from Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh had been billed a major milestone in healing a schism within Yemen’s internationally-recognized government that had erupted earlier this year. One major faction, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), has been seeking at least greater autonomy, if not full-independence, for portions of southern Yemen and had declared self-rule in the port city of Aden. Earlier in December, Saudi Arabia announced it had brokered the formation of the new power-sharing government agreed on by factions loyal to long-time President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who has led the country since 2012, and the STC. As such, various news outlets were filming the arrival of the cabinet officials, who were also accompanied by Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik and Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Said Al Jaber, when the attacks occurred. Initial reports have said that mortars , rockets, or drones , or a mixture thereof, may have been employed. Video footage does show the aftermath of what appears to be multiple explosions and at least one projectile, possibly a rocket or missile, hitting the tarmac. Gunfire is also heard, but is unclear if there were any attackers on the ground. Clips also show the officials, who had been deplaning, rushing back into the aircraft. All of the Yemeni cabinet ministers, as well as Prime Minister Abdulmalik and Ambassador Al Jaber, reportedly escaped unscathed and were eventually moved safely to a presidential palace in Aden, which has served as the de facto seat of the country’s internationally-recognized government after the Houthis took control of the official capital, Sana’a, in 2015. “We and the members of the government are in the temporary capital of Aden and everyone is fine,” Prime Minister Abdulmalik wrote on Twitter. “The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war being waged against the Yemeni state and our great people, and it will only increase us [sic] insistence on fulfilling our duties until the coup is ended and the state restored and stability, mercy for the martyrs and healing for the wounded.” Despite their denial, the Houthis certainly have the means and motives to have carried out this attack. The group has also demonstrated the ability to launch relatively precise missile and drone attacks on various targets, including multiple locations inside Saudi Arabia . There is also unconfirmed video circulating on social media purporting to show what might be some of the projectiles being fired at the airport from the direction of Taiz. That city, which lies to the northwest of Aden, is under Houthi control. This attack on Aden International Airport does follow a noticeable uptick in missile and drone strikes against targets in Saudi Arabia, as well as other attacks or attempted attacks on ships in the Red Sea involving naval mines and remote-controlled explosive-laden boats , that the Houthis have claimed or that have otherwise been attributed to them. Just last week, Saudi officials said that a commercial cargo ship had hit a naval mine in the southern end of the Red Sea, but provided no additional details. However, the formal denial of involvement in the attack on the airport in Aden today is notable, as well. The Houthis do not shy away from claiming responsibility for attacks, even ones against civilian infrastructure were innocent bystanders have been hurt or killed. The group also has a robust propaganda apparatus that regularly releases footage of missile and drone launches together with footage of the aftermath of those strikes. With all this in mind, it’s unclear why the Iranian-backed rebels would deny having carried out such a high-profile and already well-publicized attack on the Saudi-backed Yemeni government they are presently fighting if they had actually done so. As such, there is also a possibility, although much more remote, that members of the STC, or other Yemeni factions within the pro-Saudi camp, who may be unhappy with the terms of the power-sharing deal brokered in Riyadh may have carried out this attack themselves. It is worth pointing out that violent factionalization within the Saudi-led coalition is not new, though it is perhaps under-reported, even beyond the skirmishes between forces loyal to President Hadi and the southern separatists this year. It has also been present at the highest levels of that coalition in the past. In 2018, a report emerged that the United Arab Emirates (UAE), then a member of the Saudi-led campaign against the Houthis, had hired a mercenary hit squad to assassinate members of the Yemeni political party Al Islah. That group was and remains a pro-Saudi organization with a strong relationship with the government in Riyadh. In 2019, the UAE formally left the coalition fighting the Houthis. Whoever was responsible for this attack, it remains to be seen exactly how it might further complicate the conflict in the country and United Nations-backed efforts to reach a more robust peace deal between the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis. That the core of the new power-sharing government appears to have escaped the incident unharmed does significantly reduce the chance of a new political crisis erupting immediately. No matter what, the attack underscores just how fragile the situation in Yemen remains and how even the highest echelons of the country’s government are often at risk on a day-to-day basis.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A fisherman in Indonesia, referred to only as Saeruddin, recently brought in a very different kind of haul, catching what appears to be a Chinese underwater drone. At least two other very similar, if not identical ocean glider-type unmanned undersea vehicles have been found in Indonesian waters in the past two years. This raises questions about whether the Chinese government is discreetly conducting underwater surveys of routes between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean , information that could be especially useful for its submarines transiting through these areas while submerged. Saeruddin reportedly nabbed the drone on Dec. 20, 2020, near the Selayar Islands, an archipelago that is part of Indonesia’s South Sulawesi province, in the central part of the sprawling nation, which consists of more than 17,000 individual islands. He subsequently handed it over to local police, who then turned it over to the Indonesian military.Â A glider-type unmanned undersea vehicle recovered off the coast of Indonesia’s Selayar Islands in December 2020., via Twitter A report from Indonesian outlet detikNews said that the drone, which had what appeared to be some kind of sensor array in its nose, was just under 7.4 feet long, not counting what appears to be a long antenna or sensor extending from the rear end. Pictures of the unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) show that it has a torpedo-shaped body with a pair of wings mounted toward the center and a vertical tail.Â Twitter user @Jatosint was among the first to note the strong similarities to the Sea Wing UUV , a design developed and produced by the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences’ (CAS) Shenyang Institute of Automation and that has been in use since at least 2014. An ocean glider-type underwater drone, Sea Wing moves forward in the water, aided by its wings and tail, by repeatedly diving and then surfacing again. It performs these maneuvers using an internal system, essentially a balloon that expands and contracts as pressurized oil moves in and out, which alters its buoyancy. A fisherman in Selayar Island, South Sulawesi, has found a UUV: Length: 225 cm Tail: 18 cm Wingspan: 50 cm Trailing antenna: 93 cm Very similar to China's 'Sea Wing' UUV, which, if it's true, raised many questions especially how it managed to be found deep inside our territory pic.twitter.com/RAiX8Xw2BK — JATOSINT (@Jatosint) December 29, 2020 China has made questionable claims in the past that Sea Wing drones have been able to remain at sea for more than 30 days and dive down nearly four miles below the surface. CAS publicly uses Sea Wings for oceanographic research with sensors capable of measuring things such as the strength and direction of currents and water temperature, oxygen levels, and salinity. These are common tasks for these types of UUVs, which are in use around the world, including by military forces.Â Sea Wing unmanned undersea vehicles arrayed in front of a Chinese Academy of Sciences research ship., Chinese Academy of Sciences In December 2019, the Chinese survey ship Xiangyanghong 06 launched 12 of these UUVs into the Eastern Indian Ocean. CAS said the group of drones ultimately traveled more than 12,000 kilometers, or 7,500 miles, collectively. Chinese authorities did not report any of the drones going missing, but it is worth noting that initial reports said that 14 of the drones , rather than 12, had been deployed. At the same time, it’s not clear if the prevailing currents would have been able to carry a disabled Sea Wing all the way to the waters off the Selayar Islands. This is not the first time that an apparent Sea Wing drone has been found in Indonesian waters, either. In January, one was recovered near the Masalembu Islands, some 400 miles west of the Selayar Islands. In March 2019, yet another one was found in the waters around the Riau Islands even further to the northwest. These three groups of islands are situated in bodies of water that form important parts of multiple maritime routes that stretch between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.Â Noted that this is at least the second time Sea Wing UUV found in Indonesia In March 2019, a fisherman made similar findings on Tenggel Island/Village, Riau Islands ðŸ“¸Laduni & TribunNews https://t.co/3lvZzhdXwI pic.twitter.com/ASxAdWPs6B — JATOSINT (@Jatosint) December 29, 2020 Yep, there are the two incidents in the article. @Peatland_Boy just highlighted a third, also a Sea Wing glider — H I Sutton (@CovertShores) December 29, 2020 A map showing the locations of, left to right, the Riau Islands, the Masalembu Islands, and the Selayar Islands, where apparent Chinese underwater drones have been recovered in the past two years., Google Maps Though we don’t know the exact configurations of the UUVs that have been found in the waters around Indonesia, glider-type underwater drones are also regularly used for conducting hydrographic surveys and otherwise helping with the creation of underwater maps . This kind of information is useful for creating accurate maritime charts to support naval operations, as well as commercial shipping and civilian sailing activities. Having detailed maps of the contours of the seabed is particularly valuable to the crews of submarines sailing submerged under the waves. As China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) works to project power further and further beyond the country’s coastlines , having up-to-date maritime maps and charts for various critical waterways will be ever more important for both day-to-day activities and any actual future combat operations. The South China Sea is already a hotly contested body of water, with virtually all of the countries in the region disputing Beijing’s expansive territorial claims . In 2017, there was also a report that the Chinese government was testing how glider-type UUVs, possibly versions of the Sea Wing, could act as communications and data-relay nodes to help rapidly transmit information that might be useful for detecting and tracking foreign submarine movements in the South China Sea. That same year, news had emerged of Chinese plans to establish a network of underwater sensors in that region, ostensibly for environmental research, which could also have potential anti-submarine warfare applications.Â A handout photo showing personnel from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Oceanology, or IOCAS, handling what appears to be a Sea Wing UUV, which accompanied a 2017 story about the use of glider-type underwater drones to support anti-submarine warfare operations., via SCMP While we can’t say for sure what any of these UUVs have been up to in Indonesian waters, suspicions about potential dual civilian and military activities are hardly surprising, either. In fact, a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Dalang III class rescue and salvage ship snatched a U.S. Navy glider that had been conducting an oceanographic survey right out of the waters of the South China Sea in 2016, surely in part to try and see if it was actually gathering more substantial intelligence information. Being able to examine the glider and its payloads could have provided some level of useful information for China’s own intelligence arms. The Indonesian military has very likely been picking over the drones that the country’s fishermen keep recovering, looking to glean any kind of useful details about their capabilities and activities. As Chinese naval activity through the Western Pacific and out into the Indian Ocean continues to grow, it seems equally probable that these kinds of finds will become more and more common. In 2018, a Vietnamese fisherman recovered what appeared to be a Chinese torpedo , possibly leftover from a drill of some kind, a find that also underscored the increasing PLAN presence in the South China Sea region. In 2015, Chinese authorities themselves announced that a fisherman had recovered what they said was a torpedo-shaped underwater intelligence “robot” off the coast of Hainan Island in the South China Sea, which is home to a major PLAN base . One has to imagine, if nothing else, that Indonesian fishermen are increasingly on the lookout for more unusual catches in the waters around the country.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report says that the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration has finished the planned production run of controversial low-yield W76-2 nuclear warheads for the U.S. Navy’s Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and delivered all of them to that service. This revelation comes just weeks before President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office. Biden has said that fielding this weapon, which some experts say worryingly increases the chances of the U.S. government using nuclear weapons in a crisis, is a “bad idea.” The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees the development and production of nuclear weapons and manages America’s nuclear deterrent stockpile, provided the new details about the W76-2 program in its annual Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan for Congress. NNSA released the unclassified version of this report on Dec. 28, 2020. Personnel at the Pantex plant in Texas load a Mk 4A reentry vehicle containing a W76-1 warhead into a container for transport. The W76-2 warhead fits inside the same reentry vehicle., YouTube capture “The W76-2 is the nation’s response to the low-yield ballistic missile requirement called for in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review,” the NNSA report says. “In FY 2020, assembly of the W76-2 was completed, with the full quantity produced and delivered to the Navy.” The 2020 Fiscal Year ended on Sept. 30. We don’t know how many W76-2s were completed in total or how many are deployed on Trident D5s loaded on the Navy’s Ohio class ballistic missile submarines , or SSBNs, at any one time. Reports had emerged in January that the USS Tennessee had become the first boat to head out on a deterrent patrol carrying Tridents armed with these warheads. NNSA had previously announced the completion of the first W76-2 at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas, in February 2019. How exactly the W76-2 differs from previous W76 warheads is classified, but it is understood to be a derivative of the W76-1 design. NNSA crafted the W76-1 as part of a life-extension program for existing W76s and delivered the last of these overhauled warheads to the Navy in 2019. The latest Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan confirms that some W76-1s were subsequently converted into W76-2s. The official W76-2 program logo. Mk 4A refers to the reentry vehicle that the warhead sits inside when loaded into the Trident D5 missile., NNSA The W76-1 has an estimated yield of approximately 100 kilotons, while that of the W76-2 is believed to be around just five kilotons . If that latter estimate is accurate, the W76-2 would have only one-third of the yield of the Little Boy bomb that the U.S. dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima during World War II. It’s also worth noting that the Navy’s Trident D5s can be armed with W88 warheads , which have a reported approximate yield of 475 kilotons, as well. Each one of these missiles is capable of carrying up to 14 warheads, as well, but successive arms control agreements with Russia mean that they typically only have five or six loaded inside at a time. Of course, the stated strategy behind the W76-2 means that it would defeat the purpose of those warheads if there were loaded together with W76-1s or W88s and it’s unlikely that more than one or two of them would be fitted to any one missile. The maps below were created using NUKEMAP , an online tool created by nuclear weapons historian Alex Wellerstein, presently a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. They show the approximate extent of various effects on the Washington, D.C. area from the detonation of, from right to left, a W88, a W76-1, and a W76-2, based on their estimated yields. The gray outer circles show the maximum extent of light damage, such as broken windows. The yellow circles, clearly visible in the cases of the W88 and W76-1, is the extent of thermal radiation, which can cause third-degree burns. The other colored bands reflect more extensive damage and the spread of radiation, as well as the immediate fireball, the latter of which is outlined in red., NUKEMAP It is notable that NNSA was able to deliver the entire planned production run of W76-2s to the Navy within 17 months. Production and delivery of the W76-1 warheads took more than a decade to complete, though that effort did also involve a larger number of total warheads. The speed with which the W76-2s were produced would also seem to bolster previous reports that have posited that this warhead is a version of the W76-1 with its second stage removed to dramatically lower its yield. That some W76-1s were directly converted into W76-2s would seem to add further weight to that existing analysis. The W76-1, as well as the original W76, are understood to be two-stage thermonuclear weapons wherein an initial atomic reaction triggers a second, more powerful one. Beyond the W76-2’s design and capabilities, that the Navy now has the full quantity of these warheads in its inventory is significant by itself. President Donald Trump’s Administration initiated the development of this weapon following the completion of the last Nuclear Posture Review in 2018. The ostensible reasoning behind its development was a need for added flexibility to respond to certain contingencies, especially a limited nuclear strike by a hostile adversary. This requirement was driven in no small part by concerns that the Russian government had adopted a so-called “ escalate-to-deescalate ” policy wherein it might use a small number of low-yield nuclear weapons to effectively force the end of a conflict on terms favorable to Moscow. At least in theory, the idea would be to shock an opponent or opponents, such as the United States and NATO, into seeking some sort of negotiated settlement rather than further escalating the situation. The Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Tennessee . This boat was the first to deploy with Trident D5s armed with W76-2 warheads., USN Experts have questioned whether Russia actually has such a policy. Regardless, the Kremlin has stated in no uncertain terms that it would respond to a strike involving lower-yield warheads in the same way it would to any nuclear attack, with massive retaliation . This makes sense since it would impossible for Russian officials to know what kind of warheads an incoming Trident D5 might be carrying until they hit. With all this in mind, critics have warned that the W76-2 could lower the U.S. government’s thresholds for the employment of nuclear weapons, in general. This, in turn, would increase the danger of a crisis escalation into a full-blown nuclear conflict, which could have apocalyptic implications for the entire globe. The Trump Administration has denied the W76-2 increases the likelihood of a nuclear exchange, but this has only raised more questions about when the U.S. government would then be prepared to use it rather than higher-yield nuclear weapons. President-elect Biden has himself been critical of the W76-2, calling them a “ bad idea ” and saying that their existence makes the U.S. government “more inclined to use them” in the past. In 2019, California Senator Kamala Harris, now Vice President-elect, was among those to call for a ban on the deployment of these low-yield nuclear warheads. There have been calls, as recently as this month , for Biden to end production of these weapons, as well as remove any existing ones from service, when he takes office in the new year. Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, at left, and his running mate Kamala Harris, at a campaign event in August 2020., AP It remains to be seen now what will happen to the W76-2 stockpile now that it has been revealed that production of these warheads is complete. The Biden Administration could still very well remove them from service. If they are indeed relatively limited conversions of the W76-1 design, it may be possible to return them to their original configuration. Still, converting the W76-2s into W76-1s would take some amount of time and resources. The incoming Biden Administration already plans to conduct a thorough review of the U.S. government’s nuclear modernization efforts, which began under President Barack Obama and were further expanded under President Trump. As The War Zone has pointed out in the past , it is, at best, questionable if it will be possible to sustain the entire overarching effort, which is set to cost more than $1 trillion , in total, over the next 15 years or so. The looming prospect of budget cuts on the horizons will only make this more challenging. “We have to modernize our deterrent,” a former U.S. government official told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “But we cannot spend the amount of money that is currently being allocated.” Whatever course of action the Biden Administration pursues with regards to the W76-2, it’s a decision that will now have to cover the entire stockpile of those warheads.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released video and photos of an F-15C Eagle fighter jet destroying a towed target at very close range with one of its Sidewinder air-to-air missiles , during a mission flown off the coast of the United Kingdom. It’s relatively rare imagery showing one of the air superiority fighters doing just what it was designed to do — being “the baddest guy in the air,” in the words of three-time MiG-killer and retired Eagle pilot Cesar “Rico” Rodriguez . The photo sortie took place during a live-fire exercise over the Atlantic Ocean on December 8, 2020. The event was run by the 493rd Fighter Squadron , the “ Grim Reapers ,” which has its F-15Cs based at RAF Lakenheath , England, as part of the resident 48th Fighter Wing, the “Liberty Wing.” An F-15C fires a Sidewinder training missile over the Atlantic Ocean, December 8, 2020., U.S. Air Force/Staff Sgt.

From another aircraft, we then see the heat-seeking missile slam into the target, leaving sparks and debris in its wake nearly as the launching F-15 passes it by. You can watch a video of the exercise here : According to the U.S. Department of Defense, “The training helped pilots gain real-world experience by using infrared-guided missiles aimed at flare packs being towed 300 feet behind a subscale drone.” The press release added that “the training enabled Liberty Wing fighter pilots to meet mission requirements, becoming combat-ready in a wartime environment.” It was not revealed what type of drone was used, but this may well have been launched from Aberporth , on the coast of west Wales, which is a center of unmanned aerial vehicle testing in the United Kingdom.

While the “Mike” Sidewinder dates from the later years of the Cold War, it’s still regularly carried by F-15s and other fighters, despite the introduction of the far more capable AIM-9X Sidewinder . Nevertheless, there is some commonality between the two weapons, as the AIM-9X retains the rocket motor, fusing system, and warhead of the AIM-9M.

So we at The War Zone were surprised to see a picture recently of a load of B61 and B83 nuclear gravity bombs on an open flatbed trailer, even though they turned out to be inert ones bound for a test. Sandia National Laboratories released the picture, a full version of which is seen below, as part of a review of its accomplishments in the 2019 Fiscal Year. The image, which shows what appears to be six B61 trainers, including one with an orange-colored body section and tail unit representing the newest B61-12 variant , and two B83 trainers, loaded on the trailer is undated. So, although we know it was taken between Oct. 1, 2018, and Sept. 30, 2019, we don’t know exactly when or where it was shot. Inert B61 and B83 nuclear bomb test units on a trailer being readied for shipment in support of a test sometime during the 2019 Fiscal Year., Sandia National Laboratories The official caption says “Fleet of B61-7, B61-11 and B83 test units loaded for shipment.” However, there does not appear to be any examples of the bunker-busting B61-11 , which has a distinctive nose and tail assembly from other B61 variants, among the bombs on the truck. Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, wrote in a Tweet that there looked to be inert training versions of the B61-3 and 4 bombs, as well. You can read more about the entire B61 family, America’s longest-serving air-dropped nuclear bomb, in this past War Zone feature . “B-2 Aircraft Monitor and Control testing was completed using a full load B61-12 weapon simulator,” an additional block of text under the image in Sandia’s 2019 Fiscal Year accomplishments report says. “This was the first time a full load of digital interface weapons has been demonstrated on the B-2 bomber . The test was completed in conjunction with final AMAC testing needed to certify the weapon system.” “Aircraft Monitor and Control” refers to “equipment installed in aircraft to permit nuclear weapon monitoring and control of safing, pre-arming, arming, and fuzing functions on nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems,” according to an unclassified U.S. Air Force manual titled “ Nuclear Certification Program ” and dated Jan. 16, 2020. In short, AMAC is the complete suite of systems on a nuclear-capable aircraft that allows its crew to actually arm a nuclear weapon in flight before employing it, or safe it again, if necessary. Making sure that the new B61-12, each one of which is literally worth more than its weight in gold, works with the AMAC equipment inside the stealthy B-2, the U.S. Air Force’s only bomber presently certified to carry nuclear gravity bombs of any kind and one of America’s key nuclear weapon delivery platforms , would be an absolutely essential part of the process of integrating that weapon onto that aircraft. An inert B61-12 test unit loaded on a U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle combat jet., USAF It makes sense that Sandia, together with the Air Force, would have also taken the opportunity to test out how those systems worked together with a full load of bombs equipped with digital interfaces to connect to the B-2’s onboard AMAC equipment. In his Tweet, the Federation of American Scientists’ Kristensen noted that the inert bombs seen on the trailer only represented around half of the total number of live nuclear weapons one of these bombers can carry at once. It’s not clear if more bombs were employed in the test beyond those seen in the picture. An annotated image showing an array of munitions laid out in from of a B-2 bomber, including B61-7, B61-11, and B83-1 nuclear gravity bombs., via FAS.org It’s also unclear why they were transported in such an open way to wherever the test was conducted. One would imagine even inert nuclear bombs used for testing and training would have representative systems inside them that would be of intelligence value to foreign countries, such as Russia or China. We know the that test units had digital interfaces installed, at least, and for AMAC testing it seems very likely that they also had Permissive Action Links (PAL) in place, which are safety systems to prevent authorized use of the weapons. Those are highly sensitive and usually require some degree of elevated security. It’s possible that the risk of loss was determined to be low due to the overall distance the truck had to travel. It may not have even had to leave a controlled U.S. government facility to make its delivery. Without more context about the circumstances behind this shipment of B61 and B83 inert training bombs, we just don’t know. No matter what the exact circumstances were, it’s still an interesting and unusual picture. That a single B-2 can carry nearly twice the number of bombs seen on the back of this truck also underscores the immense destructive capability of each one of America’s 20 stealth bombers.

Thomas Newdick,"Updated on Dec 9, 2020",The Tale Of A World War II British Submarine That Shot Down An Enemy Plane With A Torpedo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Without a doubt, one of the most unusual aircraft “kill” claims of all time is one attributed to the British submarine HMS Umbra , which is said to have brought down an enemy aircraft, using torpedoes, during World War II. The incident occurred in the Mediterranean, while the submarine, under the command of then-Lieutenant Lynch Maydon , was engaging an enemy ship. Such was the ferocity of the resulting explosion after the torpedoes hit that vessel, that Maydon reported that one of the aircraft escorting it was engulfed in a column of fire that leaped 1,000 feet into the air. Were such a scenario to be considered for a fictional account of naval warfare, it would likely be rejected as too far-fetched. However, the submarine’s commander described the action in some detail and it was widely reported in newspapers at the time. When it returned from its patrol, HMS Umbra was flying the Jolly Roger to signify its successful hunting and the flag included a symbol of the aircraft claimed destroyed. The significance of this type of flag, and its symbols, is something The War Zone discussed in this past article . Officers and crew of HMS Umbra , together with their Jolly Roger success flag, at Devonport in February 1943., Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons As of December 1942, HMS Umbra , a Royal Navy U-class submarine built by Vickers-Armstrong, was on patrol off the coast of Tunisia, where Allied and Axis forces were locked in desert warfare after the Allied Operation Torch landings in North Africa the previous month. Meanwhile, the last major naval battles of the Mediterranean campaign were being fought between the United Kingdom and the Axis forces of Germany and Italy, with the British submarines exacting a steady toll on enemy shipping. On December 9, HMS Umbra sighted the German merchant vessel Süllberg , south of the Tunisian coastal town of Hammamet. The 1,699-ton steamer Süllberg had been built in 1912 and was now carrying 645 tons of ammunition, 62 tons of other stores, four artillery pieces, and 23 vehicles. These were being transported from Trapani in Sicily to Sousse in Tunisia, to help the Axis forces repel the growing Allied advance into that country. The following official account of what happened, compiled from details in patrol reports and logbooks, is available online at uboat.net , with HMS Umbra indicated by its pennant number, P35. Note that the submarine was armed with four tubes in the bow for 21-inch torpedoes , plus another four reloads, as well as a 3-inch gun: (All times are zone -1) 0930 hours — Sighted a small merchant vessel, estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000 tons, bearing 342°. She was proceeding close inshore south of Hammamet. Estimated enemy course was 250°. Altered course and went to full submerged speed to intercept further South on the coast. 0945 hours — Enemy course was now seen to be 235°, speed was 9 knots. The target was keeping very close inshore. P35 proceeded to the South-West at full speed. 1057 hours — Turned to a firing course. 1100 hours — In position 36°14’N, 10°32’E fired three torpedoes from 4,500 yards. A very heavy explosion followed after about four minutes. Another very slight explosion followed about 15 seconds after the heavy explosion. 1109 hours — Returned to periscope depth. All that was left of the target was a magnificent column of orange and white smoke rising to about 1,000 feet in the air. It’s important to note that this description doesn’t mention the possibility that the explosion aboard the Süllberg had not only sent that vessel to the bottom of the Mediterranean, but had also brought down one of the aircraft that was escorting it. Crew transfer personal items between HMS Umbra and a supply ship, with the submarine’s 3-inch gun in the foreground., Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons It’s also worth noting that in World War II, low-flying aircraft faced a genuine threat of damage or destruction from detonations on the ground, or water, below. It was by no means unusual for bombers or attack aircraft to be hit by debris thrown up from the targets they were supposed to be attacking, with potentially disastrous results. At times, such incidents even stretched the boundaries of credibility. On one occasion, for example, a German Luftwaffe fighter strafing a British train was brought down by debris that flew out of the locomotive’s exploding boiler. Even today, the pilot of an aircraft attacking objectives while flying at low-level must be alert to debris from exploding targets, as well as terrain and air defense threats. Italian Fiat G.50 and German Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters over the Mediterranean. While there is no available record of whether the escorts for the Süllberg were German or Italian, if they were indeed twin-engined, then they may well have been Luftwaffe Bf 110s. , German Federal Archives/Wikimedia Commons HMS Umbra enters Devonport naval base, flying the Jolly Roger and with a reduced-size pennant number., Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons Oddly, for such a unique claim, the incident is absent from many of the histories of the campaign in the Mediterranean, suggesting that, after an initial flurry of media attention, the British Royal Navy may have considered that evidence was inadequate for it to be made official. The few published accounts available even describe the event happening in different years — 1942 or 1943 — but it’s still possible to piece together a more complete story, at least from the submarine crew’s point of view. By the time that HMS Umbra returned to its Devonport base after its patrol, in February 1943, the official narrative as distributed by the Associated Press ran as follows: HM Submarine Umbra home from the Mediterranean — she “torpedoed” an enemy plane. HMS Umbra has returned home after more than 12 months in service in Mediterranean waters. Under the command of Lieutenant S L C Maydon, DSO, RN, one of the Navy’s most successful submarine skippers, the Umbra fought many daring actions and wrought much destruction among enemy shipping. Her strangest adventure occurred early this year [sic] when she torpedoed an enemy aircraft in mid-air. Lieutenant Maydon sighted an enemy supply ship being escorted by three aircraft. He fired a torpedo and “all that was left of the target was a magnificent column of orange and white smoke rising to quite a thousand feet.” He noticed that only two of the three enemy aircraft were in sight. “It was hoped,” reported Lieutenant Maydon, “that the third may have gone to great heights when the target blew up.” South African-born Lieutenant S L C Maydon, DSO, RN., Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons Together with that report, a series of photos were taken by the Admiralty showing the victorious crew of the HMS Umbra as they returned. The photo of the crew surrounding the conning tower reveals details of the Jolly Roger flag , which bears the silhouette of an apparent twin-engine aircraft directly above the skull and crossbones. The addition of a victory marking representing an aircraft was not uncommon, with wartime submarines being routinely equipped with anti-aircraft guns for defending against air attack when operating on the surface. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the flag is a life raft symbol denoting the rescue of two airmen from another downed German aircraft, a Junkers Ju 88 , which happened two days after the torpedo “kill.” Another of several different Jolly Rogers flown by HMS Umbra , with the downed aircraft emblem now to the right of the skull., Wikimedia Commons Some of the symbols that can be found on a submarine’s Jolly Roger flag, and what they mean., NAVYNEWS.CO.UK News of the — possible — unique victory then spread fast, although reports still noted that there was no official confirmation of the enemy aircraft having been destroyed. “Circumstantial evidence,” explained the San Bernardino Sun , of March 9, 1943, “has led the crewmen of a British submarine to conclude that they ‘torpedoed’ an enemy aircraft.” Again, the same source incorrectly cites the date as early 1943, based on when HMS Umbra had actually returned to port. One of the members of the crew of HMS Umbra poses with a bunch of bananas on returning to the United Kingdom., Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons Other accounts were more circumspect. Captain George Simpson was the commander of the Royal Navy’s Tenth Submarine Flotilla, headquartered in Malta, at the time of the sinking of the Süllberg . In The History of the British ‘U’ Class Submarine , Simpson is quoted as having said of the incident: P35 is inclined to claim one aircraft from the explosion though the torpedoing of an aircraft at 1,000 feet seems more like the story of a rear gunner . While Captain Simpson sounds less than convinced by the explanation provided by Maydon and his crew, that’s not to say that it didn’t happen. Lieutenant Maydon and another crewman in the cramped interior of HMS Umbra. , Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons Regardless of whether or not HMS Umbra had genuinely brought down an enemy aircraft with one or more torpedoes, Maydon was decorated for his actions, receiving a second Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in recognition of his submarine having sunk seven merchant ships — the same sub and captain had also destroyed the Italian heavy cruiser Trento . Before the end of the war, the latter part of which saw him commanding a submarine in the Pacific, Maydon would also receive the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), for which the citation read: “For outstanding courage, skill and undaunted devotion to duty in successful patrols in one of HM Submarines.” It is not surprising that the supposed aircraft kill, being unsupported by evidence other than the crew’s own conclusions, would not have been mentioned in relation to Maydon’s various honors. It is for this reason, perhaps, that it appears to have quickly begun to be neglected by official histories, too. As for Maydon himself, he entered politics soon after the war and doesn’t seem to have spoken about the incident at any length before his death in 1970, at the age of 57. Lieutenant Maydon and other crewmen in the conning tower after the return of HMS Umbra to Devonport . , Crown Copyright/Wikimedia Commons While it is likely we will never know conclusively whether HMS Umbra was successful in downing an enemy aircraft on December 9, 1942, the supposed remarkable event, and the media’s reaction to it, certainly deserves to be remembered as more than just a footnote in military history.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2021",Snakehead Will Be The Largest Underwater Drone That U.S. Nuclear Submarines Can Deploy,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is moving ahead with plans to expand its unmanned undersea vehicle capabilities with the acquisition of a new large-displacement design as part of its Snakehead program. The service wants these drones, which its nuclear-powered submarines will be able to launch and recover underwater, to initially be able to scout ahead or monitor certain areas, as well as perform other intelligence-gathering missions. It has plans to use them in other roles, including as electronic warfare platforms, in the future, as well. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) announced that it had issued the final request for proposals (RFP) for Snakehead’s Phase 2 on Dec. 23, 2020. The actual RFP is only available, at present, to companies bidding for the contract to build these large-displacement unmanned undersea vehicles (LDUUV). The Navy plans to pick a winning offer before the end of the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, 2021. An artist’s conception of a Snakehead large-displacement unmanned undersea vehicle (LDUUV)., USN “Snakehead is a long-endurance, multi-mission UUV, deployed from submarine large open interfaces, with the capability to deploy reconfigurable payloads,” an official Navy press release regarding the RFP said. “It is the largest UUV intended for hosting and deployment from submarines.” “Initial vehicles will be designed to support Intelligence Preparation of the Operating Environment (IPOE) missions,” it continued. “Future vehicle missions may include deployment of various payloads.” IPOE , in layman’s terms, is a mission set that involves collecting information about a particular area or objective ahead of an operation, to help with planning. UUVs used in this role typically have a mixture of sensors, including side-scan sonars and bathymetric sensors , to create detailed maps of the seabed and otherwise identify potential hazards or other objects of interest. The video below shows the kind of imagery that be produced using side-scan sonar. https://youtube.com/watch?v=soaw3FuqSCk For submarines, this information is critical for being able to safely ingress and egress from a designated area, especially a denied or otherwise sensitive one, safely and with the lowest chance of detection. If the objective itself is underwater, such as a sunken object or undersea cable , a Snakehead could also help confirm its general location and the presence of any hostile forces in the area, all without its host boat having to perform this kind of reconnaissance directly, which could put it at increased risk. What obstacles might exist under waves would be valuable details to pass along to teams of special operators, which the submarine in question might be carrying itself, as they prepare to carry out various missions. This could include raids, either in the water , such as blowing up ships in a port using munitions such as limpet mines , or ashore. An IPOE mission could also be in support of a larger-scale amphibious operation . The Navy has said in the past that Snakehead should be able to carry out more general intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as well. IPOE and general ISR were the mission sets that the service said it planned to explore using the initial Phase 1 Snakehead design, which it previously expected to have in the water by 2019. At the time of writing, the first Phase 1 Snakehead is still under construction and is not expected to be delivered until sometime next year. Details about this initial Snakehead UUV are extremely limited and it is unclear what companies exactly are involved in building it. In 2019, Advanced Technology International did announce that it had awarded a contract to General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems to develop a Lithium-ion Fault Tolerant (LiFT) battery for the Phase 1 Snakehead. The goal was for the LiFT battery to provide improved safety and reliability , while also offering sufficient power to support longer-endurance missions. A General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems LiFT battery., General Atomics In the meantime, the Navy’s Unmanned Undersea Vehicles Squadron One (UUVRON-1), the service’s first dedicated underwater drone squadron, which it activated in 2017, has been using two earlier LDUUVs that the service previously acquired from the Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at Pennsylvania State University. The first these was the 28-and-a-half-foot-long, 10,800-pound Sea Horse, the development of which began in 1999 and that you can read more about in this past War Zone piece . The more recent Sea Stalker, also known as Large Training Vehicle 38, is a derivative of the Sea Horse design. Penn State ARL’s Sea Horse underwater drone., USN The Sea Stalker UUV, also known as Large Training Vehicle 38., USN Without being able to see the full RFP, we don’t know what the Navy wants in terms of general performance, endurance, or other capabilities from the Phase 2 Snakehead design. The official contracting notice does say that the service expects these new drones to have some ability to operate with at some autonomy, using the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture (UMAA) and the Common Control System (CCS). UMAA is a common set of systems and software that the Navy has been working on to support work on increased autonomous functionality for UUVs, as well as unmanned surface vessels (USV). CCS provides a common tool for UUV and USV mission planning and execution, as well as monitoring the systems on those vehicles during operations. A briefing slide offering a very broad overview of the Unmanned Maritime Autonomy Architecture concept., USN It’s also not clear what submarines might be slated to employ Snakeheads in the future. The Navy has said that “the LDUUV will achieve full integration with Modernized Dry Deck Shelter and Payload Handling System-equipped submarines.” The Navy presently can fit Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) onto its four Ohio class guided-missile submarines , or SSGNs, each of which can carry two at a time. At least six more Virginia class attack submarines are configured to carry a DDS, but there are not enough of the shelters to equip all of those boats at once. The Seawolf class spy submarine submarine USS Jimmy Carter , which is a unique subclass unto itself, has an 100-foot-long Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) section of its hull that also has a large “ocean interface” that could be used to launch UUVs. A briefing slide showing submarines configured to carry Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) and specific DDS assignments as of 2014., SOCOM The DDSs allow for the deployment of large payloads , such as miniature submarines that special operations forces use to get to shore undetected, like the existing Mk 8 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) and the future Mk 11 Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) and Dry Combat Submersible (DCS). They also provide a way for large numbers of special operators to deploy from a submerged submarine all at once. Work to modernize the existing DDS design has been focused on increased the overall volume inside the shelter to accommodate larger payloads, as well as the integration of an improved payload handling system to enable it to launch and recovery large, semi-autonomous or fully-autonomous UUVs. A briefing slide showing changes made to the DDS as part of modernization efforts., SOCOM Another briefing slide showing how an improved DDS would allow for the launch and recovery of a large UUV., USN It’s worth noting that the Navy has explored other kinds of payload handling systems for deploying LDUUVs, such as Sea Horse, as well as other kinds of drones, from the missile tubes on the Ohio class SSGNs, versions of which are likely in service now. You can read more about these developments in this past War Zone feature . The service has also launched Sea Stalker on the surface from an Arleigh Burke class destroyer on at least one occasion. A briefing slide showing how a Universal Launch and Retrieval Module capable of deploying the Sea Horse UUV, among other types, could be installed in one of an Ohio class SSGN’s missile tubes., General Dynamics Electric Boat The Navy also envisions the Phase 1 and 2 Snakeheads as leading to a more robust Increment 1 type that might also support anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare activities, such as helping in the hunt for enemy ships and submarines. This would give submarines something very loosely similar to the “loyal wingman” type drones that the U.S. Air Force, among others , is developing to work together with manned combat jets . A 2018 briefing slide showing the Navy’s plans for the Snakehead program, as well as other UUVs., USN They could also provide the aforementioned electronic warfare capability. An electronic warfare payload would require the UUV to run on the surface, or at least close enough to extend some kind of mast above the waterline. Still, an LDUUV carrying out this mission would be a much lower-risk alternative to doing it with a traditional crewed submarine. A Snakehead could also be employed in a similar fashion equipped with an electronic support measures (ESM) system to grab information enemy emitters, such as radars and communications nodes, to help build a so-called “ electronic order of battle ” of hostile fleets at sea or facilities along the shoreline. The same could be said for intercepting certain communications. In a similar fashion, Snakeheads could be employed as a component of the Navy’s shadowy, networked electronic warfare “ecosystem,” known as the Netted Emulation of Multi-Element Signature against Integrated Sensors, or NEMESIS. This program has been working to develop a ‘system of systems’ to work together across a battlespace via linking electronic warfare-enabled manned and unmanned aircraft, ships, and submarines. Combined, they could effectively create highly convincing phantom fleets to distract and confuse opponents, as well as employ other highly impactful electronic warfare tactics in a cooperative manner. Unmanned underwater vehicles are clearly a component of this program based on its own illustrations. You can read more about this project in detail in this past War Zone feature . USN The Snakeheads will all be modular, open-architecture designs to allow for the relatively rapid integration of new payloads and other functionality as time goes on. These underwater drones look set to significantly expand the ISR capabilities of various submarines, especially the Ohio SSGNs, which are already very capable in this regard and are in high demand as a result, as well as future submarines the Navy is eyeing to specifically carry and deploy larger payloads . The service has also historically had a small number of special mission submarines available for espionage and other more specialized intelligence-gathering missions, such as the aforementioned USS Jimmy Carter , any future examples of which could also make good use of this kind of unmanned underwater capability. The Snakehead program represents just one tier of the Navy’s overall UUV plans, which also include small and medium tiers of underwater drones, as well as an extra-large category. Last year, Boeing won the contract to build the service’s first four XLUUVs, also known as Orcas, which you can read about in more detail in this previous War Zone story . In general, the Navy sees unmanned platforms that operate below and above the waves as increasingly critical to its future operations, especially in support of distributed warfare concepts of operation that will require its forces to conduct a wide array of missions across broad areas simultaneously. Together with the service’s expanding communications and data-sharing networks , as well as those in development elsewhere across the U.S. military , growing fleets of UUVs and USVs are set to offer important additional operational capacity across multiple mission sets with more limited personnel, infrastructure, and logistical demands. Above all else, Snakehead will give America’s already incredibly capable fast attack and guided-missile submarine fleet a whole new capability set that will drastically expand the tactical playbook available to them. One can see where this is headed in the future, and given the limited number and already overtasked nature of the U.S. Navy’s submarine fleet, Snakehead could allow an SSN or SSGN to be in two places at once, at least to some degree. Overall, this capability is a huge step in moving more deeply into the unmanned space when it comes to the shadowy world of undersea warfare. Next year could be a particularly important one for the Snakehead program with the Phase 1 design set to finally hit the water and the service now also planning to get work started on the improved Phase 2 type.

Thomas Newdick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 23, 2021",Russia’s Predator-Style Drone With Big Export Potential Has Launched Its First Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Orion unmanned aerial vehicle has reportedly fired guided missiles for the first time, marking a significant step toward the country deploying its first fully-operational armed drone. As well as missiles, the drone has reportedly also been recently tested with unpowered guided glide bombs. While the Russians have said that the Orion drone — also known by the project name Inokhodets, meaning pacer in Russian — has dropped guided glide bombs before, during combat trials in Syria in 2018 , the launch of a powered weapon is a new development. The milestone for the Orion was reported today by Russia’s state-run media outlet RIA Novosti , which quoted an unnamed “source in the military-industrial complex.” What “small-sized guided missiles” the drone fired in these reported tests were not revealed and it is also possible that they refer to a guided version of the existing 57mm S-5 rocket . This weapon is broadly similar to the U.S.-designed AGR-20A Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II), which adds a laser guidance kit to the ubiquitous Hydra 70 unguided rocket. An Orion UAV on display at the Army-2020 exhibition outside Moscow, with examples of the Kh-50 and lightweight KAB-20 guided bombs., Mickel nitride/Wikimedia Commons More advanced guided-missile options for Russia’s drones are also being developed by Russia’s Tactical Missile Corporation (KTRV), which produces a wide variety of ordnance for manned combat aircraft. The company is reportedly developing both 110-pound and 220-pound missiles to arm unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Only a mockup of the 110-pound Kh-50 has been seen in public so far. The guided glide bombs employed in the recent tests could include two different 110-pound weapons that were revealed by Kronshtadt, which makes the Orion, in 2018. These are the KAB-50 and UPAB-50. While the KAB designation indicates a “corrected aerial bomb,” typically using laser or TV guidance, the UPAB designation signifies Universalnaya Planiruyushchaya , or “universal gliding,” and these weapons tend to feature pop-out wings to extend their range. However, there are other similar weapons available from Russian manufacturers, including a family of bombs produced by the Aviaavtomatika company, which combine different guidance kits and tail sections with warheads weighing either 55 or 110 pounds. These weapons are characterized by their boxy bodies. Almost simultaneous with the report of the new weapons trials, the Russian Ministry of Defense released its 2021 calendar, which includes a heavily retouched image of the Orion carrying KAB-20 guided bombs — a 44-pound weapon, also apparently produced by Kronshtadt, and which appears very similar visually to Turkey’s drone-launched MAM-L . The laser-guided MAM-L is also primarily designed for use on armed drones and has become a key munition for the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aircraft, which has been used to great effect in various recent conflicts, including in Syria and Libya . This combination also saw notable success in the recent conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a war that we covered in depth in this previous feature . The armed Orion UAV in the Russian Ministry of Defense calendar for 2021., Russian Ministry of Defense The launch of missiles, of whatever kind, together with other ongoing weapons trials, would also seem to point toward the Orion moving toward operational capability. In April 2020 , Kronshtadt handed over a first Orion drone system — including three flight vehicles — to the Russian Ministry. At the time, however, the manufacturer admitted that the ministry “had additional requirements that were not originally included in the technical specification.” As a result, the drones had to be returned to Kronshtadt after delivery, and unspecified modifications made to satisfy the customer. The unnamed source in the RIA Novosti article said that large-scale delivery of the Orion to the Russian military “will restore parity with a potential enemy in this class of equipment,” but the country still lags far behind both China and the United States in developing UAVs of this kind. https://youtube.com/watch?v=wEHXdogxgwM With a gross weight of around 2,250 pounds and with an endurance of up to 24 hours, the Orion is somewhat akin to Russia’s answer to the MQ-1 Predator, with which it shares a long, straight wing and a pusher-propeller powerplant. The U.S. Air Force, however, retired the MQ-1 in 2018 and then moved over to the enlarged and more capable MQ-9 Reaper, which has a gross weight of 10,500 pounds. Now, in fact, the U.S. Air Force is looking beyond the Reaper, to the next generation of tactical drones that will replace the MQ-9, as The War Zone discussed here . MQ-1B Predator armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. , USAF While the Reaper achieved operational capability in October 2007, serious work on a Russian medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) equivalent to the Predator only really took off after the Russo-Georgian War the following year. To meet an urgent need for a surveillance drone, Russia procured the Israeli-made Searcher II , which it produced under license as the Forpost. The Forpost, a license-built version of the Israeli Searcher II., https://vitalykuzmin.net/Wikimedia Commons Development of the Orion began in 2011 when Kronshtadt received a research and development contract for the Inokhodets program and a first flight of the drone took place at Protasovo airfield, near Ryazan in central Russia, in October 2016. In November 2019 one of the prototypes was lost in a crash at Protasovo, although the causes of this incident are unclear. A particular problem faced by the Orion development program has been the lack of reliable powerplant. The original engine was produced by Itlan and was a heavily modified, Russian-made version of the Austrian Rotax 914 , as used in the Predator, with an added turbocharger that proved tricky to integrate. While this engine was installed in the first three drones delivered to the Russian Ministry of Defense, an alternative, fully indigenous engine has since been developed by the Agat company and may be installed in subsequent production batches. It is also possible that these engine difficulties are what resulted in the defense ministry demanding the manufacturer introduce changes in the Orion, and it is not currently known when the drone will be fully accepted for service. The Rotax 914 engine, a Russian-made derivative of which powers the initial Orion UAVs., Herr-K/Wikimedia Commons As well as the weapons, the Orion has two mission payload bays for other equipment, with a turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser target designator to deliver guided weapons, being typically installed in the forward bay. Additional cameras or a surveillance radar can be mounted in the central bay. Other planned payloads include signal intelligence systems and electronic warfare jamming pod. The full-service introduction of the definitive Orion will clearly be a big step forward for Russia’s military drone program and it will be the country’s largest operational UAV. The first frontline Russian operator is reportedly expected to be a UAV regiment of the Russian Navy, located at Severomorsk-1, part of the Northern Fleet, and which currently operates Forpost drones. In Russian Navy service, drones are primarily used for coastal reconnaissance and target surveillance for warships and fighter jets. These missions don’t require the types of lightweight weapon systems that are now being tested on the Orion, suggesting that they may be intended primarily for the export market. Kronshtadt, together with Russia’s Rosoboronexport arms export company, is already offering an export-configured Orion-E version to foreign customers. Despite being relatively new to the armed drone game, Moscow is now entering a booming sector, with the highly influential use of the Turkish TB2 attack drone in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in Libya. The TB2, which has ushered in a ‘game-changer’ level of attention on the modern battlefield, is in the same class as Orion. However, there is no direct competitor to the armed Orion or the TB2 from the United States, but China also offers a similar capability set. Well-publicized problems reported with this class of Chinese-made drones in the hands of export operators could potentially offer a route to help Moscow secure very lucrative armed drone sales. Russia also has a far more extensive weapons export customer list to tap into than China or Turkey, especially when it comes to military aircraft. Competition from the United States is now primarily in the form of the MQ-9 that has been heavily pushed as of late , helped by relaxed export restrictions . The MQ-9, however, is a significantly more capable, and expensive, system. Additionally, those loosened U.S. export restrictions are still quite restrictive compared to the competition. Russia also has a track record of using creative financing to help sell military equipment to foreign customers, including low and very low-interest loans. They will also sell these systems to pretty much anyone. On the domestic front, the demand for a UAV in the MALE class is also only likely to grow. Following the initial delivery of Orions to Russian Navy units, there is every reason to believe that they will fairly rapidly be issued to the Russian Aerospace Forces, too, who have learned about the potential advantages of armed drones from their experiences fighting in Syria. During that conflict, lower-end drones were used by Russia for surveillance, general target spotting, and bomb-damage assessments and were somewhat hampered by line-of-sight and/or low-bandwidth satellite communications restrictions. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see exactly what types of communications and connectivity options will be available for Orion once it emerges fully from development. Regardless, a more advanced and armed UAV would allow both the hunter and killer mission to exist on a single platform, simplifying operations and drastically expanding tactical possibilities, such as taking far greater advantage of targets of opportunity. Exactly when we may see operational Orion UAVs carrying armament operationally is uncertain, but it will be equally fascinating to see whether this drone can make its mark on the burgeoning export market, as well as within the Russian military.
