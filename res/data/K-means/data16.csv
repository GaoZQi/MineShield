By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Attorney General Bill Barr had what appeared to be a very peaceful moment as he rode aboard an Alaska Air National Guard C-130 on Friday. Strapped into an elevated spotters seat adjacent to the airlifter’s rear paratrooper door, Barr quietly sat transfixed as he gazed out of the C-130’s open rear ramp and onto the majestic Alaskan terrain passing by below. For one of the most polarizing figures in Washington, D.C. today, a guy who became embattled in political controversy from pretty much the day he took office, the flight must have been a nice reprieve from the realities of his job. The Hercules mission reportedly occurred due to a mix up in logistics and was not planned long in advance, but the places the Attorney General was traveling to may have required the C-130’s short and rough field capabilities. Barr is touring Alaska to discuss justice and law enforcement matters with the local powers that be. This included making stops at remote villages to discuss combating high rates of crime in some of these native communities. The aircraft used likely belonged to the 211th Rescue Squadron of the Alaska Air National Guard. The unit flies the HC-130J Combat King II.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 13, 2019",Stratolaunch Reportedly Shuts Down Leaving World’s Largest Plane With An Uncertain Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Space launch company Stratolaunch , which the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen had founded nearly a decade ago, is reportedly in the process of closing down for good and will be selling off all of its physical assets and intellectual property rights. The news comes less than two months after the firm’s massive Roc aircraft, the largest plane ever flown, took the sky for the first time . On May 31, 2019, Reuters reported that Vulcan, Inc., an investment firm that Allen had also established to support Stratolaunch and many other projects, had decided to shutter the space launch unit, citing multiple unnamed individuals familiar with the plans. The War Zone also heard this earlier in the week. Allen died in October 2018 after a battle with cancer. Founded in 2011, Stratolaunch hoped to offer low-cost and flexible access to space, using the Roc aircraft , named after the mythical bird of prey capable of carrying off an elephant, to air-launch expendable and reusable space launch vehicles. A cost-effective air-launched space access concept would allow customers to get payloads into space on shorter notice than with traditional rockets and launch them from the best possible location, a potential game-changing capability that you can read about more here . Scaled Composites, a part of Northrop Grumman, had actually designed and built the aircraft. The plan had been for Roc to conduct its first test launch of a Pegasus XL space launch rocket, another Northrop Grumman product, in 2020. Stratolaunch and Northrop Grumman both declined to give comments to Reuters for its story and it is unclear whether or not the test program will continue under the latter company’s direction, but it seems unlikely at this point. There had already been serious questions about Stratolaunch’s future after Allen’s death. In January 2019 , the company publicly announced that it was canceling work on a family of space launch vehicles , including a reusable space plane known as Black Ice, as well as new rocket motors to power them. “Stratolaunch is ending the development of their family of launch vehicles and rocket engine,” the firm said in a statement at the time. “We are streamlining operations, focusing on the aircraft and our ability to support a demonstration launch of the Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL air-launch vehicle.” An artist’s rendering of Stratolaunch’s Roc and the company’s proposed family of space launch vehicles, including Black Ice at the far right, together with three Northrop Grumman Pegasus XLs at the far left., Stratolaunch One of Reuters ‘ sources said that Stratolaunch was already working with a skeleton staff of only 21 people by April 1, 2019, down from nearly 80 just four months earlier. These individuals reportedly were focused on supporting the Roc’s first flight . Another source told Reuters that Judy Allen, chair of Vulcan, a trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust, and Paul Allen’s sister, had let the flight occur to honor her late brother’s wishes, but had already decided to close down Stratolaunch afterward by that point. It’s unclear what may have led to Stratolaunch’s demise. Dramatic drops in the cost of launching payloads into space, driven in no small part of by space launch firm SpaceX’s pioneering work on its Falcon series of reusable booster rockets, had also called into question how cost competitive the air-launched option might be in the end. Development and construction of the Roc alone had cost at least $200 million . By 2018, SpaceX was offering to loft payloads up to 50,000 pounds into low earth orbit at prices starting around $50 million . Three years earlier, NASA had spent $56 million to use a different launch aircraft to boost a payload into orbit on board a Pegasus XL, which has a maximum payload capacity of less than 1,000 pounds. It is worth noting that this contract included “firm-fixed launch service costs, spacecraft processing, payload integration, tracking, data and telemetry and other launch support requirements,” according to official reports . Of course, Stratolaunch wasn’t targeting the same exact same part of the market as traditional launch firms, such as SpaceX, either. Virgin Orbit is still aiming to offer similar aerial space launch services in the near future. If it looks like Stratolaunch’s concept, centered around the Roc, can deliver competitive pricing along with greater flexibility, this might point to a future for the company’s physical assets and intellectual property, all of which will reportedly now be up for sale. Much of the Roc’s initial development costs are paid for and the aircraft has already flown, though we don’t know how much more it needs to get to a launch. As noted, Northrop Grumman, a major contractor to the U.S. government, might have an interest in acquiring the remnants of Paul Allen’s ambitious space project for its own use. Other space launch firms, including Virgin Orbit, might have an interest in picking up where Stratolaunch left off, as well. Some have wondered whether it might be possible to covert the Roc to other uses, including as a carrier for modular cargo pods . The U.S. military or another government entity could seek to buy the plane and design rights to the rest of Stratolaunch’s developments and continue that work internally, too. The United States, in particular, has a long-standing interest in aerial space launch concepts, which you can read about more here and here . We will have to wait and see what happens next, but it would be a sad end to Paul Allen’s space dreams if the Roc were to end up grounded for good.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Dive Into These Incredible New Images Of Navy SEALs Operating Underwater,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s Sea, Air, Land teams, or SEALs , are just about the best known of Americans elite special operations forces. But when it comes to pictures and videos of the largely secret world of the teams training or out in the field conducting actual operations , there is an even more limited number of them that show off their “sea” capabilities and few high-resolution examples of them actually conducting activities underwater. So, we’re very lucky to have just gotten a new spread of official photographs of a pair of SEALs from Naval Special Warfare Group Two, or NSWG-2, during dive operations training on the East Coast of the United States. The Navy posted the pictures online on May 29, 2019. They’re broken into two very distinct sets, one showing the SEALs rising out of the water onto a beach while the others have them swimming underwater, including under an unspecified vessel. The location given is just “Atlantic Ocean” and each one has the same lengthy caption , which is as follows: A member assigned to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 conducts military dive operations of the East Coast of the United States. U.S. Navy SEALs engage in a continuous training cycle to improve and further specialize skills needed during deployments across the globe. SEALs are the maritime component of U.S. Special Forces and are trained to conduct missions from sea, air, and land. Naval Special Warfare (NSW) has more than 1,000 special operators and support personnel deployed to more than 35 countries, addressing security threats, assuring partners and strengthening alliances while supporting Joint and combined campaigns. NSW’s ability to understand the operational landscape, adapt quickly and evolve capacity, capabilities and concepts based on operational requirements is one of our great strengths. NSW forces are trained to conduct primary direct action and special reconnaissance core activities and as well as to build partner capacity in or out of the maritime environment in order to support the U.S. Navy, U.S. Special Operations Command, geographic combat commanders and ultimately, national objectives across a full range of political and operational environments. There’s essentially no detail about the nature of the training exercise. The beach photographs do show the SEALs wearing camouflage wetsuits and closed circuit scuba gear with rebreathers. These are essential for SEAL underwater operations since they work more efficiently than more basic systems and recycle unused breathing gas, allowing divers to stay beneath the waves for much longer periods. The closed system also typically circulates that air at warmer temperatures and more normal pressures, making the experience closer to normal breathing, which helps reduce fatigue. The closed circuit system also means that they’re not leaving a trail of tell-tale bubbles as they breathe underwater, which could compromise their position as they sneak up on a boat or toward a beach. SEALs train to perform a variety of direct action raid and reconnaissance missions that could involve transiting underwater to and from ships and submarines. In the shots of them on land, they’re also armed with heavily modified M4A1 carbines with EOTech XPS-series holographic sights and muzzle devices that could accept a quick detach sound suppressor. In one of the pictures, one of the rifles has a flashlight attached to the side of the carbine’s accessory rail handguard. USN USN USN USN The underwater shots do not involve any weapons and take on an otherworldly appearance in many cases. One shows a SEAL taking a hammer to the bottom of a boat, potentially simulating the removal of some sort of debris. SEALs, who are themselves the successor to the Navy’s Underwater Demolition Teams, regularly train to both conduct covert attacks on ships and other maritime targets, including through the placement of limpet mines and other explosive charges, as well as explosive ordnance disposal duties. This latter mission could include clearing threats underwater, as well as on beaches ahead of larger amphibious operations. USN USN USN USN USN USN Even with such limited details about the circumstances surrounding the photos, they offer an excellent look at the kind of missions SEALs are prepared to perform anywhere in the world on short notice. You’ll note one of the underwater shots shows a SEAL wearing a GoPro style camera, too. Maybe we can expect the Navy to release some excellent video footage to go along with these images in the near future. USN Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",Need A 50mm Cannon For Your Bradley Fighting Vehicle Replacement Design? Just Ask The Army,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is considering handing out 50mm XM913 Bushmaster automatic cannons to companies working on possible replacements for the service’s Bradly Fighting Vehicles . At least one defense contractor is already pitching a design using this weapon, which reflects a growing Army interest in larger guns for its armored fighting vehicles as potential opponents, particularly Russia, are also up-gunning their fleets . On May 30, 2019, the Army provided new details on the potential “government furnished equipment” deal, which the service had first announced it was looking into the month before, via FedBizOpps , the U.S. government’s main contracting website. If the plan goes ahead, companies working on proposals for what is formally known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program could receive an XM913 as early as July 1, 2019. This would initially only support work on integrating the weapon into their design. Ammunition for live firing tests would be available in August 2019. The package would also include the XM913’s ammunition handling system, which is almost as important as the gun itself. It is a computerized automatic arrangement that allows the gunner to pick certain ammunition types within the magazine in order to best engage certain target sets. The weapon can even take down small unmanned aerial vehicles and low-flying helicopters using proximity-fuzed rounds. The Army did not specify what types of ammunition it will provide along with the gun. The Army’s contracting notice says that only two complete guns systems would be available in total, suggesting that the Army could ask for them back after a certain amount of time in order to send them to other competitors. As it stands now, likely entrants include General Dynamics Land Systems Griffin III , a version of the KF41 Lynx from Rheinmetall and Raytheon, and a variant of BAE Systems’ CV90 . The Army has also recently reviewed Germany’s Puma armored fighting vehicle . The Griffin III already packs the XM913 gun. At least at present, the Army is not officially mandating that proposed designs use this cannon, but has reportedly made it clear that they would prefer that the vehicle carry some sort of 50mm weapon. General Dynamics’ Griffin III with its 50mm XM913 gun at maximum elevation., Joseph Trevithick The XM913 is a fairly mature design. The gun is a refined example of the Bushmaster III automatic cannon design, which Alliant Techsystems, or ATK, first brought to market more than a decade ago. The Bushmaster III itself had leveraged decades of work done on earlier examples of the Bushmaster family, including the 25mm M242 cannon on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle . In 2014, ATK announced that its aerospace and defense components would merge with Orbital Sciences Corporation, which resulted in the creation of Orbital ATK. Northrop Grumman bought this company in 2018. The initial Bushmaster III was as 35mm cannon, but was convertible into 50mm with minimal modification by using ammunition that fired larger diameter projectiles, but that used same cartridge base dimension. The Army, for a time, considered potentially up-gunning the Bradley to use the 35mm version. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0a_54_bGwsk In addition, starting around 2010, the Army explored the possibility of using a 50mm variant of the Bushmaster III to shoot down small unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as artillery shells and rockets. To this day, the service continues to employ a ground-based version of the Navy’s Phalanx Close-in Weapon System (CIWS) named Centurian, which features a 20mm Vulcan cannon, in this role. The gun the Army developed as part of this Extended Area Protection and Survivability program, or EAPS , featured a longer receiver to accommodate longer, guided projectiles with programmable warheads. The service eventually shelved the EAPS effort and its gun. A US Army briefing slide giving a rough overview of the EAPS concept and showing a rendering of the modified Bushmaster III., US Army Though the XM913 leverages experience from the EAPS program, it is more closely related to the original 35/50mm Bushmaster III and uses the same sized ammunition as the initial design, Northrop Grumman confirmed to The War Zone in an Email. The company delivered the first example of this improved cannon to the Army in 2018. The service also evaluated an advanced 40mm design from BAE Systems, which you can read about more here , last year, but appears to have decided not to pursue that option. Companies vying from the Bradley replacement contract can reportedly opt to use a smaller 30mm gun if they design cannot accommodate a 50mm weapon. The Army is already in the process of adding the 30mm XM813, a variant of the smaller Bushmaster II, onto some of its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles. In December 2017, the first examples of these variants, known as the Stryker Dragoon , which was an interim design, arrived in Europe. On May 23, 2019 , the service announced that it had awarded contracts to five companies to develop an improved turret design based on its experience with those vehicles. A week later, it emerged that Senators working on crafting the U.S. defense budget for the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year had proposed almost tripling the funding for modifying Army Strykers to carry the 30mm guns. Concerns that potential opponents, especially “great power competitors” such as Russia and China, are developing armored vehicles that out-gun the Army’s existing armored fleets, as well as those in the Marine Corps , are driving these efforts to increase firepower across the board. In particular, the Russians are very actively pursuing a number of different designs that use a multi-purpose 57mm cannon. Russian firms have explored adding turrets with this gun onto armored fighting vehicles and heavy armored personnel carriers and are also developing a vehicle focused primarily on short-range air defense, known as the Derivatsiya-PVO . https://youtube.com/watch?v=-d_7XNA8IKc So, while the Army may be willing to accept 30mm cannons in the near term to help close the gap, the service clearly sees the potential for a more firm requirement for larger guns in the future. This, in turn, has reportedly raises fears that if potential Bradley replacements don’t take this in account from the very beginning, that it could lead to time-consuming and costly development programs and modification efforts to add in a bigger gun in the future. This is likely what drove the Army to make clear its unofficial preference for 50mm guns and what is now pushing it to consider just providing the weapons to competitors outright. In November 2018, the service were already “contemplating a longer proposal development period . . . and concurrent bid sample delivery,” in part to provide more time to competitors to work on the issue of the main gun, according to Inside Defense . A US Army briefing slide from 2014, showing the XM813 in relation to an “Enhanced Bushmaster III 50mm.”, US Army The Army’s Bradley replacement schedule remains relatively aggressive, with the goal of down-selecting to two designs in early 2020 . Each of the winning companies would build 14 prototypes for a head-to-head competition. The service wants to begin actually replacing Bradleys by 2026. It remains to be seen what designs will meet the rest of the Army’s requirements , but it seems increasingly clear that the winning vehicles will be armed with 50mm cannons, or at least have the ability to fit them in the future.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Carrier Group In Recent UFO Encounters Had New Air Defense Tech Like Nimitz In 2004 Incident,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, new details have emerged regarding a series of still unexplained encounters that U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet pilots had with unidentified flying objects while conducting training missions off the East Coast of the United States in 2014 and 2015. The War Zone has already explored this new report in detail and looked at how improved radars had played a major role in detecting these objects. But what wasn’t immediately apparent was just how ideal the situation could have been during at least some of these incidents for observing and recording the performance and signatures of potentially revolutionary flying machines under real-world conditions by the very best combined group of air defense assets on the planet. The aircraft and ships present around the time these events occurred were equipped with the most advanced sensor fusion, networking, and computer processing capabilities available. In fact, collectively they represented the first time these capabilities were deployed across an operational Carrier Strike Group. This directly mirrors the peculiar conditions present during the famous “Tic Tac” incident involving the USS Nimitz, her air wing , and her escorts off the Baja Coast in 2004. Prior to the latest revelations regarding encounters with Navy pilots that occurred just a couple of years ago, we dug deep into the 2004 Nimitz event, as well as the greater issues surrounding the topic and its strange resurgence within the Pentagon, in this expose which you should read for better context of the information we are about to present below. Author’s note/update: People are asking a lot of questions that are answered in the pieces linked above. Reading them is essential to understanding the full situation and the many variables and issues at play when it comes to this complex and quickly developing topic. On May 26, 2019, The New York Times dropped the new details, sourced in part from on the record interviews with two Navy fighter pilots from VFA-11 Red Rippers – Lieutenants Ryan Graves and Danny Accoin – as well as off the record comments from three more aviators. Broader information about the events from 2014 and 2015 has been passed around as random facts and rumor for some time and the famous “gimbal video” is reportedly from one of these encounters, but the Times piece offers hugely significant additional context with actual names attached to it. “People have seen strange stuff in military aircraft for decades,” Graves told the Times . “We’re doing this very complex mission, to go from 30,000 feet, diving down. It would be a pretty big deal to have something up there.” But the Times ‘ story doesn’t mention that between 2014 and 2015, Graves and Accoin, and all the other personnel assigned to Carrier Air Wing One (CVW-1) and the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , as well as everyone else in the associated carrier strike group, or CSG, were taking part in series of particularly significant exercises. The carrier had only returned to the fleet after major four-year-long overhaul, also known as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), in August 2013. This process included installing various upgrades, such as systems associated with the latest operational iteration of the Navy’s Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and its embedded Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) architecture. This is a critical detail. When the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group encountered the Tic Tac in 2004, it was in the midst of the first ever CSG-level operations of the initial iteration of the CEC. Regular readers of The War Zone will be well aware of these systems and we recently provided the following detailed explanation of their capabilities as part of the aforementioned in-depth expose regarding unidentified flying objects, their potential origins, and Pentagon’s sudden change in willingness to discuss them: “At its very basic level, it [CEC] uses the Strike Group’s diverse and powerful surveillance sensors, including the SPY-1 radars on Aegis Combat System -equipped cruisers and destroyers, as well as the E-2 Hawkeye’s radar picture from on high, and fuses that information into a common ‘picture’ via data-links and advanced computer processing. This, in turn, provides very high fidelity ‘tracks’ of targets thanks to telemetry from various sensors operating at different bands and looking at the same target from different aspects and at different ranges. Whereas a stealthy aircraft or one employing electronic warfare may start to disappear on a cruiser’s radar as it is viewing the aircraft from the surface of the Earth and from one angle, it may still be very solid on the E-2 Hawkeye’s radar that is orbiting at 25,000 feet and a hundred miles away from the cruiser. With CEC, the target will remain steady on both platform’s CEC enabled screens as they are seeing fused data from both sources and likely many others as well. We are talking about a quantum leap in capability and fidelity here folks. The data-link connectivity and the quality of the enhanced telemetry means that weapons platforms, such as ships and aircraft, could also fire on targets without needing to use their own sensor data. For instance, a cruiser could fire a missile at a low-flying aircraft that is being tracked by a Hawkeye and an F/A-18 even though it doesn’t show up on their own scopes. This capability continues to evolve and mature today and will be the linchpin of any peer-state naval battle of the future that the U.S. is involved with. But back in 2004, it was new and untested on the scale presented by the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group as it churned through the warning areas off the Baja Coast. The key takeaway here is that if ever there was an opportune time to capture the very best real-world sensor data on a high-performance target in near lab-like controlled settings offered by the restricted airspace off the Baja Coast, this was it. And by intention or chance, this is exactly what happened. VFA-11 Red Rippers Super Hornet lands aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Pilots from the Red Rippers have come forward to discuss their encounters with UFOs before their 2015 deployment., USN Beyond the greatly enhanced fidelity of the overall situational ‘picture,’ CEC provides via sensor fusion across a wide array of disparate platforms spread out over a large area, the NIFC-CA part of it enables an impressive amount of targeting-quality data sharing between Navy ships and aircraft. This, in turn, opens up a new range of tactical possibilities. For instance, it enhances the ability to engage opponents using remotely-launched weapons. As an example, the cruiser or destroyers in a CSG could fire SM-6 surface-to-air missiles at targets outside of the range or below the radar horizon of their own sensors by using the radar telemetry from one of the carrier’s Super Hornets flying far forward of the vessel’s location. In another scenario, an E-2D could feed targeting information to Super Hornets to allow them to fire beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles at opponents without having to activate their own radars. CEC/NIFC-CA is truly an amazing and important set of capabilities that have been in development for decades. Between August 2013 and August 2014, the Theodore Roosevelt supported flight tests of Northrop Grumman’s experimental X-47B unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). But at the same time, the Navy was moving toward preparing the entire Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, including CVW-1, to become the first ever to deploy operationally with CEC/NIFC-CA functionality. The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group’s encounters with UFOs only began toward the end of 2014, according to the Times . This is around when CVW-1’s Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron One Two Five (VAW-125), the “Tigertails,” became the very first to fly the latest E-2D Advanced Hawkeye , which is a core component of the Navy’s NIFC-CA/CEC plans. A hugely powerful upgrade of the venerable E-2C Hawkeye , the E-2D also has additional, still-classified electronic support measures and networking capabilities. One of VAW-125’s E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes prepares to launch from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in April 2015., USN In January 2015 , the CSG as a whole, including CVW-1 and the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Normandy, which had also received upgrades to add in CEC/NIFC-CA capabilities, entered a process known as a Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX) ahead of its deployment. “[COMPTUEX] is designed to replicate real-world combat scenarios that can potentially present themselves to our strike group at any time during a deployment,” U.S. Navy Captain Scott F. Robertson, Normandy ‘s commanding officer at the time, said in a statement in January 2015. “We are going to experience real combat situations from all angles, there will be training evaluations from a hostile ship boarding, submarine attacks, and enemy ships or vessels trying impede their justice upon our strike group.” Of course, we don’t know how close any of the CSG’s other assets were when Graves and Accoin, or their unnamed wingmen, actually encountered the UFOs. We also don’t know if any of these incidents occurred during the COMPUTEX period specifically, but the ships and aircraft had been conducting other training activities together for months already at that point and continued to operate together afterward. The Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Normandy , in front, trains with the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Farragut , seen behind, and other ships assigned to the Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group in September 2014., USN Still, it’s hard to overstress just how opportune the conditions would have been for this particular CSG, or elements of it, equipped with the world’s best air defense capabilities to be tested against exotic and high-performance flying craft. It is also curious that sightings of these objects would coincide with the first major deployment of the CEC/NIFC-CA architecture and the E-2D Hawkeye and then more would occur around the time of the Strike Group’s work up to the first operational deployment of those systems. It is entirely possible that this was all just a coincidence, but it would be a particularly amazing one if that was the case, especially as it directly mirrors the situation and conditions in which the Tic Tac incident took place with the Nimitz CSG a decade earlier. We have to stress that all this doesn’t definitively mean these objects belong to the United States Government or that their presence was directed or expected by the powers that be, but this revelation adds to the likelihood of those possibilities.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 6, 2018",Virginia Soldier May Have Had Bigger Plans For Drug-Fueled Rampage In Stolen Armored Vehicle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Virginia State Police and Virginia Army National Guard have now provided significant new details regarding a bizarre incident in which a Guardsman stole an M577 armored command vehicle and led authorities on an approximately 60-mile long chase. Equally odd social media postings suggest that the suspect, 29-year old Lieutenant Joshua Philip Yabut, may have intended, at least at one point, for his actions to be more than just a joyride. Yahut left Fort Pickett, a Virginia Army National Guard facility, in the M577 at 7:50 PM EST on June 5, 2018. Nearly two hours later, he came to a stop at an intersection in Richmond, the state’s capital, which is situated to the northeast of the base. Virginia State Police arrested him for driving under the influence of drugs , though they did not specify what substances he had taken, and subsequently charged him with eluding police and unauthorized use of a vehicle, both felonies. “We are extremely grateful that there were no injuries as a result of this incident, and we appreciate the great work of the Virginia State Police, Richmond Police Department, and other law enforcement and first responders who safely brought this situation to a close,” U.S. Army Major General Timothy Williams, the Virginia State Adjutant General, said in a statement. “We have initiated our own investigation, and we will determine appropriate actions once the investigation is complete.” Yahut is presently the commander of the Headquarters Company of the 276th Engineer Battalion, a Virginia Army National Guard Unit. He has been in the U.S. military for more than a decade and deployed with the Illinois National Guard to Afghanistan between 2008 and 2009. The M577 had no weapons on board at the time of the incident. Yabut reportedly had an unidentified standard issue personal weapon with him at the time, but had no ammunition. Still, the Virginia State Police determined it had no way to stop the vehicle and elected to escort it instead to keep bystanders safe. But according to a separate report from the Richmond Times-Dispatch , Yabut had posted pictures on social media earlier in the day that indicated he might have had plans for a larger rampage. One post included an online map of Washington, D.C. with the U.S. Capitol Building marked, as well as a screenshot of the Wikipedia page on the M113 armored personnel. Another appears to show him in the M577, which is a command and control derivative of the M113. On Twitter, the subsequent posts were a mix of seemingly innocuous remarks and odd, confusing statements. Right before left Fort Pickett, Yahut posted a picture of himself next to an M577 and a video that appears to show him driving it, but it is not clear if these were images of the incident in progress.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 2, 2021",What We Actually Know About Reports The White House Tried To Hide USS McCain,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Certain details remain murky, but what is clear is that White House and U.S. Navy officials discussed moving the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS John McCain “out of sight” during President Donald Trump’s recent visit to the American naval base in Yokosuka, Japan. Trump’s staff was reportedly worried that the presence of the ship would incite the President’s ire given his long-standing animosity toward one of the ship’s namesakes, the late Senator John McCain . There is zero evidence that President Trump had any knowledge of the request. In addition, at this time, there is little to no information as to where the idea originated from or how it was dealt with over time aside from the final result that nothing seems to have come of it at all. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the attempts to either hide or move the McCain late on May 29, 2019, citing leaked emails and comments from unnamed officials. The day before Trump had made a speech on board the first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS Wasp at Yokosuka. This followed remarks the President had made alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a visit to the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force’s carrier the JS Kaga . “Need all supporting units to understand the requirement for rehearsals [for the President’s visit],” a published email read. “Also, please confirm #3 will be satisfied.” The third requirement was “USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.” It is important to note that, so far, nobody in the Defense Department or the White House has denied that this request occurred or challenged the authenticity of the leaked email. We also don’t have any further correspondence showing how the discussions proceeded or who exactly sent this one email and who exactly received it. There were also reports that sailors had obscured the ship’s name on the stern with a tarp. The Navy has denied this, saying that a picture of the McCain with its name obscured was taken on May 24, 2019, and claims it was part of routine repainting. The service also went so far as to issue an official statement to this effect through the Navy Chief of Information Twitter account . Before the Journal ‘s report broke, this account had not posted a single Tweet since Jan. 11, 2014. “The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day,” the Tweet read. “The Navy is proud of that ship, its crew, its namesake and its heritage.” The Navy has also denied reports that the McCain ‘s crew specifically got the day of Trump’s speech off or that the ship’s sailors were specifically told not to wear caps bearing its name. The service says all of its personnel at Yokosuka received a 96-hour leave around Trump’s visit and that everyone had to wear eight-point caps during the President’s remarks. In addition, officials said no one had gotten orders to avoid the event on Wasp , though this would not necessarily preclude informal suggestions from certain officials that sailors from McCain stay away. Once again, the service has not denied that there were discussions about relocating the McCain or covering the ship’s name for Trump’s visit. Anonymous Navy officials have since told multiple outlets that White House staffers, including members of the White House Military Office (WHMO), and “lower level” naval officers had been working toward this end. The WHMO coordinates military support to the White House, including presidential air and ground transportation . It also provides aides to carry the “ nuclear football ” containing secret codes and a secure communications system and keep close to the President at all times, so they can order a nuclear strike from anywhere, if necessary. According to these reports, which have not been refuted, the main reason White House officials wanted the ship somewhere else was reportedly a fear that Trump could end up enraged if he saw it. Trump had a notoriously poor relationship with the late Senator, dating back to before he became president. In 2015, the presidential candidate Trump infamously insulted McCain’s service record, saying “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” Months after McCain’s death, Trump regularly takes jabs at his memory. Recently, he has begun slamming the late Senator over his role in killing a Republican healthcare plan to replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Clearly, the White House staff is fully aware of the President’s issues with the late Senator. So, “there was a lower level effort to comply with the request [to hide the ship] but when leadership became aware they ordered the tarp be taken down,” one unnamed Navy official told ABC News . “Navy leadership decided the name should not be obscured.” Trump speaks about the USS Wasp on May 28, 2019., USN It remains unclear whether or not the ship was moved in any way or if other objects were placed in front of it in response to those discussions before Navy leaders overrode the plans. The McCain is presently forward deployed to Yokosuka, Japan as part of the Navy’s 7th Fleet. The ship suffered a now infamous collision in August 2017 that resulted in the deaths of 10 sailors . The incident, coupled with another involving the USS Fitzgerald , another Arleigh Burke , two months earlier, prompted a major internal review of naval operations that exposed a host of serious issues . It is also unclear where exactly the request to stash the McCain away originated. President Trump has denied knowing about the plans at all and there is no evidence to suggest he was involved directly. “We’ll probably find out who did they thought they were doing me a favor because they know I’m not a fan of John McCain,” Trump told reporters on May 30, 2019. “I couldn’t care less whether or not there’s a boat named after his father.” It is important to note that when the Navy commissioned McCain in 1994, she was not named after Senator John McCain, but for his grandfather and father, John McCain, Sr. and John McCain, Jr. In July 2018 , the service officially added John McCain III to the ship’s namesakes. The senator passed away the following month . “I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan,” Trump had also Tweeted out the day before after the Journal published its initial story. “Nevertheless, @FLOTUS and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women – what a spectacular job they do!” Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has already denied knowing anything about the discussions. Shanahan, who is presently in Singapore, said he only learned about the incident when he woke up to the latest news. “I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain,” he told reporters on May 30, 2019. “I also think it’s important – I’d never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship. I’ve asked my chief of staff to look into the matter.” The incident raises obvious concerns about activities that could politicize the military and that White House staffers are making these sorts of requests at all, with or without Trump’s knowledge. The U.S. military takes great pains to remain apolitical and avoid conflicts of interest in this regard. With outrage still building over the attempt to conceal the McCain from Trump, it certainly behooves the Pentagon and the Navy to determine the exact chain of events, do so quickly, and set the record straight for good. But as it sits now, all we know for sure is that this was a request from White House staff that got turned down by the Navy’s chain of command and that is where it appears to have ended. Anything else is conjecture. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers Navies Sea U.S. Navy"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 8, 2020",Latest Video Of Iran’s Bond Villain-Like Ballistic Missile Lairs Shows Key New Detail,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It is no secret that if Iran thinks something is of extreme strategic value it is also at the top of their enemies’ targeting lists and it is safer buried beneath the ground than not. Since 2015, Iran has sporadically shown off videos of its elaborate and impressively large missile caverns that are not only designed to store and assemble ballistic missiles, but also to launch through from deep cylindrical concrete apertures in the roofs of specially designed subterranean firing rooms. Now a new video has been released showing another interesting, but highly logical feature of these underground bases. The video, which was posted by Iranian media just days ago, gives us a higher-definition look at some of the areas in one of the country’s missile caverns. In particular, it shows a blast door and drawbridge mechanism that opens and closes when passing from one section of the cavern to another. This is a very important feature as it means that even if one section of the cave system is successfully struck or an accidental detonation of explosive components occurs and it is destroyed, the other sections would remain isolated and should survive. The video goes on to show a number of missile components appearing to belong to the Qiam-1 short-range ballistic missile system in storage and being assembled for deployment from one of the base’s underground launch rooms. The Qiam-1 has a range of around 400 miles. We get to see a closeup of the missile launching through the thick concrete aperture in the launch room’s roof from the outside. A screengrab from this section clearly shows the launch room illuminated as the booster is fired. In the past, there were some questions as to the authenticity of the launch portions of the videos, which were often shot at long distances. The missile then climbs away through the hole and past steep terrain. By placing the fissures on a sloped mountain, it would presumably make them harder to strike directly. You can clearly see the launch room and TEL from this video shot outside the launch room’s roof aperture. , Youtube Screencap These cave complexes are not immune to conventional strike, but they are highly resistant to standoff cruise missile attacks, giving Iran time, at least under some circumstances, to fire off ballistic missiles even as an attack was underway. The U.S. has the capability to hit bunkers buried inside mountains without resorting to nuclear weapons via the gargantuan GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator guided bunker buster, but these are limited in number and require the use of a B-2 stealth bomber for delivery. The U.S. and its allies can also burrow down using smaller bunker busters dropped on the same coordinates in succession, but it is not clear if those munitions could effectively destroy such a large and segmented cavern system that is likely to feature long sections buried deep below mountainous terrain. Other videos of the caverns show long lines of missiles sitting ready for deployment on mobile transporter-erector-launchers. As such, at least some of them serve as ready storage and deployment sites for land-mobile ballistic missiles systems, as well. These facilities are in addition to Iran’s ‘underground cities’ where the missile components themselves are constructed. A handful of these are said to exist, giving Iran an ‘end-to-end’ hardened ballistic missile infrastructure. This concept is meant to act as much as a deterrent as anything else. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qiouGzIU4cc The huge investment Iran has dumped into its ballistic missile infrastructure is no surprise because of this fact. If a war were to spark off in and around the Persian Gulf, Iran would make its primary foe and its allies pay via ballistic missile barrages. This could quickly turn a limited conflict into a far wider and complex one. Even though they are not impenetrable, these facilities will be a major tactical problem to deal with during a conflict and will require plenty of combat capacity of the highest order to effectively neutralize. Clearly, the release of this latest video comes at a time of heightened tensions with the U.S. and its regional allies, and is a form of counter-messaging to the United States military’s own aggressive messaging push in regards to the risk its forces pose to Iran’s own combat capabilities. Hopefully the effectiveness of these elaborate underground installations, both in terms of launching missile barrages over substantial ranges and surviving an aerial attack, isn’t ever put to the test.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 7, 2019","Lockheed Bails On The Navy’s New Frigate Program, But Will Supply Systems To Whoever Wins (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a major development for the U.S. Navy’s future frigate program, or FFG(X) , Lockheed Martin has decided that it will not to submit a bid after reportedly having difficulty meeting the service’s latest requirements. The company will continue to be a part of the competition as a member of the team working with Italy’s Fincantieri Marine Group, which is proposing a design based on its Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM), or European Multi-Mission Frigate. The American defense giant is also in line to provide a number of systems for any winning ship design, including its COMBATSS-21 battle management system , which is derived from the Aegis combat system . USNI News got the scoop on May 28, 2019. Unnamed sources told the outlet that Lockheed Martin had informed the Navy of its decision five days earlier. The American defense giant had previously been working on a design derived from its Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) hullform. Early concept art of Lockheed Martin’s FFG(X) proposal., Lockheed Martin “We reviewed the entire program and obviously, given some of the stuff that has already happened that is outside of the contract for the program – that includes the designation of our combat management system, COMBATSS-21 , derived off of Aegis; we have the Mk 41 vertical launch system ; the processing for our anti-submarine warfare area; [and] advanced [electronic warfare] and platform integration,” Joe DePietro, the Vice President of Small Combatants and Ship Systems at Lockheed Martin vice president of small combatants and ship systems, told USNI News . “As we evaluated all of those different areas, we determined not to pursue, as a prime contractor, the FFG(X) detailed design and construction.” A model of Lockheed Martin’s FFG(X) proposal, offering a better look at the bow end of the ship., Joseph Trevithick This is certainly a sensible decision in a number of ways. As noted, beyond the various systems that Lockheed Martin will supply to the Navy no matter who wins the FFG(X) competition, it is also still the systems integrator for Fincantieri Marine Group’s offering. The two companies have worked together before on the Freedom -class. The Marinette Marine shipyard in Wisconsin, which the Italian firm bought in 2009, builds the ships. Lockheed Martin is still on contract to deliver additional examples of those littoral combat ships to the Navy and is also building another derivative, known as the Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), for the Royal Saudi Arabian Navy. A model of the MMSC., Joseph Trevithick But one of USNI News ‘ sources also said that while Lockheed Martin’s FFG(X) proposal had passed a pair of design reviews, the company had told the Navy that it simply could not rework the Freedom -class design enough to meet all the service’s requirements. The company had already lengthed the hullform to accommodate a new propulsion system. The FFG(X) requirements call for additional spacing between propulsion system components to reduce the likelihood that a single shot will be able to leave the ship dead in the water. “It does require the ship to be longer, given those separation requirements and how you plan to stagger your port and starboard configuration of the combining gear/reduction gear, running into a single shaft into a screw on either side,” DePietro had explained to Defense News in October 2018 . “You have to have a certain amount of separation and they have to be fully independent.” The Freedom -class littoral combat ship USS Sioux City ., USN In the conceptual design phase, the Navy also increased the number of Mk 41 vertical launch system cells it wanted each frigate to have from 16 to 32, which could have required an even longer hullform. Lockheed Martin never displayed a model or concept art of a revised FFG(X) design. The company’s decision leaves four other contenders in the race to build the Navy’s next frigate, including Fincantieri. Austal USA is still offering a ship based on its Independence -class LCS design . General Dynamics Bath Iron Works is proposing a version of Spanish shipbuilder Navantia’s F100 Álvaro de Bazán- class . Lastly, there is Huntington Ingalls, which has offered virtually no details about its pitch, including declining to name any other members of its prospective team. A breakdown of the FFG(X) contestants as of August 2018., USN The Navy is expecting to issue the final FFG(X) request for proposals by the end of September 2019 and wants to award the winning contract a year after that. The service then expects to buy 20 of the ships through 2030. With Lockheed Martin now out of the running, what was already set to be a heated competition looks set to become even more intense. Update: 5/29/2019— After we published this piece, Lockheed Martin reached out to us with the following statement: Lockheed Martin completed a successful design effort under the current contract, and our solution meets all of the Navy’s requirements. After careful review, we have decided we will focus our attention on the FFG(X) combat system and overall systems integration. We offer the best value to the Navy in this role while meeting our business goals. We will continue to serve as a shipbuilder for the U.S. Navy, and we’re exploring opportunities including unmanned surface vessels and the large surface combatant.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 21, 2020",U.S. Says Russia Might Be Setting Off Very Low-Yield Nuclear Weapons On This Arctic Island,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government says that Russia may be conducting low-yield nuclear testing at a remote site above the Arctic Circle in violation of its obligations under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , or CTBT. The allegation comes at a time when arms control deals between the two countries appear especially fragile . At the same time, the two nuclear-armed nations are actively working to modernize and diversify their arsenals . The Wall Street Journal was first to report the accusation on May 29, 2019, citing a U.S. intelligence assessment and comments from U.S. Army Lieutenant General Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The claims reportedly center around activities at Novaya Zemlya , an archipelago in Russia’s far north, where the country has conducted nuclear weapon testing in the past and that continues to support nuclear weapons development programs. “The United States believes that Russia probably is not adhering to its nuclear testing moratorium in a manner consistent with the ‘zero-yield’ standard,” DIA Director Ashley said in prepared remarks at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C. on May 29, 2019 . “We believe they have the capability to do it, the way that they’re set up.” DIA Director U.S. Army Lieutenant General Robert Ashley speaks at the Hudson Institute on May 29, 2019., Hudson Institute It is important to note, however, that he declined to offer any additional specifics and would not confirm whether the Russians had actually conducted any low-yield nuclear tests, despite the purported ability to do so. The Russian Embassy in Washington also denied to the Journal that the country had violated the CTBT. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000. The United States signed the agreement in 1996, but has never ratified it. However, the U.S. government has been observing a self-imposed moratorium on all nuclear testing since 1992. These agreements and declarations were the outgrowths of decades of negotiations dating back to the first-ever nuclear test in New Mexico, known as Trinity . These discussions between nuclear-armed powers had also resulted in the Partial Test Ban Treaty , or PTBT, in 1963, in which signatories agreed not to detonate nuclear weapons above-ground, undersea, or in space. The video below offers an excellent graphical representation of the extent of known nuclear testing, covering detonations between 1945 and 1998. In addition to obtaining details about the new intelligence assessment about possible Russian nuclear testing, the Journal says it has seen an unreleased 1997 presidential directive from then-President Bill Clinton. This document explains that the United States and Russia, as well as with the United Kingdom, France, and China, all exchanged letters agreeing that certain unspecified activities were exempt from the parameters of the CTBT. The treaty continues to lack a hard technical definition of what constitutes a nuclear explosion. It also allows for computer modeling and other non-nuclear testing related to nuclear weapons so that countries can ensure the safety and reliability of their nuclear stockpiles. With all this in mind, it is unclear whether or not the U.S. government is actually accusing the Russians of test firing low-yield nuclear weapons or if it is asserting that the Kremlin is not keeping with the spirit of the agreement and is exploiting technical loopholes in the CTBT to achieve the same research and development aims. For instance, evidence emerged in 2012 that Russia might have constructed a new sub-critical nuclear test facility in Novaya Zemlya. But sub-critical testing, which does not involve a full-fledged nuclear reaction, does not meet the threshold of a nuclear explosion under the CTBT, according to either Russia or the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration operates a similar facility, known as the U1a Complex , within the Nevada National Security Site for exactly this purpose. It’s also almost impossible to independently assess the new U.S. government claims without any details about the intelligence sources the U.S. government is using to make its determination about potential Russian low-yield testing. This could include a mix of intercepted communications, human intelligence, atmospheric testing , geological monitoring , and more. In 2017, there were curious and still largely unexplained reports about increased levels of radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere in Europe, which civilian researchers traced back to northwestern Russia. This also appeared to prompt the U.S. Air Force to deploy one of its WC-135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric testing aircraft to the region, though the service denied it was in response to any particular event. Reports have since emerged that the U.S. government has been monitoring Russia’s tests of its still-in-development nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, which the Kremlin says will be nuclear capable. These launches have occurred from Novaya Zemlya and would, by definition, involve a nuclear reactor smashing into the ground at the end of each test, whether it is successful or not. It is possible that these events could produce signatures similar to extremely low yield nuclear testing. There is the potential for other kinds of false positives, too. In 1997, the U.S. government accused the Russians of violating then still relatively new CTBT with a test in Novaya Zemlya, which turned out to have been a benign earthquake . Still, the United States has re-raised concerns about possible Russian low-yield nuclear testing since then and has cited it as a reason for not ratifying the CTBT in its present form. There are also questions about what value extremely low-yield nuclear testing, which would have to involve detonations small enough not to draw the public attention of civilian government agencies and researchers who also monitor for such things. “Our understanding of nuclear weapon development leads us to believe Russia’s testing activities would help it to improve its nuclear weapons capabilities,” Ashley said at the Hudson Institute. “It would be unfortunate if they were doing something at Novaya Zemlya that was not in the spirit of a zero-yield CTBT,” Siegfried Hecker, who served as the director of the U.S. government’s Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 until 1997, told the Journal . “But would the Russians somehow be able to gain an advantage for new systems if they were doing something slightly more than that? My general sense is no.” But none of this necessarily means the Russians might not see some value in such tests or that they have laid the groundwork for more serious testing if it were to become obvious that the U.S. government was looking to pull out of the CTBT entirely. The Trump Administration insists it has no plans to abandon the treaty and resume nuclear testing, but in 2018 the President instructed the Department of Energy to be ready to detonate a nuclear device within six months of getting the order. The previous requirement was for the department to be able to resume testing within two to three years . “The United States will not seek Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, but will continue to observe a nuclear test moratorium that began in 1992,” the Pentagon said in its most recent Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which came out in 2018, a notable change in the phrasing from the previous NPR. “This posture was adopted with the understanding that the United States must remain ready to resume nuclear testing if necessary to meet severe technological or geopolitical challenges.” Since Trump took office in 2017, there have been growing calls for the United States to resume nuclear testing to support programs to modernize the country’s nuclear arsenal. This effort, which is costing hundreds of billions of dollars, began under President Barack Obama, but has grown even larger under the Trump Administration. Regardless of whether Russia is or isn’t conducting secret low-yield nuclear testing, or is preparing to do so in response to the United States doing the same, a dispute over the CTBT is the latest in a worrying trend regarding major arms control agreements. Last year, the Trump Administration announced it would abandon the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, over the Kremlin’s violations of that deal , which you can read about in more detail here . There are now questions as to whether the U.S. government will look to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, due to a host of issues you can find out more about here . There are already strong indications that the United States and Russia , and potentially other nuclear powers around the world , are already in the midst of a new arms race. If the CTBT were to completely collapse, it could only further inflame the situation. That is to say nothing of the potential ecological and health concerns that come along with setting off nuclear weapons , even in extremely controlled environments sealed underground. With all this in mind, it will be very interesting to see what evidence the U.S. government provides publicly to support its claims and how these concerns about Russian activity might influence its own opinion on nuclear testing in the near term.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 24, 2019","No, This Bizarre Installation Near Area 51 Is Not A Secret Military Base","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The sprawling Nevada Test And Training Range is an incredibly intriguing place full of strange man-made oddities that has long been a canvas for individuals to paint their wildest dreams and biggest fears upon due to the classified nature of much of what goes on there . But not everything within its bounds or in its vicinity is some military secret or a base used for clandestine operations of one type or another. Far from it in fact. Yet many media outlets really don’t care about that fact. Case in point, a story that is making the rounds, including on Russian state-owned outlet Sputnik and on social media , that claims a very odd looking installation not too far from Area 51 has some very shady purpose. It doesn’t. The story was spurred from a video posted by a UFO/Aliens-centric Youtuber that calls the strange formation in the remote Garden Valley roughly 50 miles north of Area 51 into question. He says the site is a newly-built underground military base. The truth is that it is far from newly-built and it certainly is not an underground anything, nor does it belong to the military. In fact, it is a gargantuan sculpture of sorts by a very famous artist. Google Earth Contemporary artist Michael Heizer has been working on the massive installation, named City , since 1972. Once it is finished, which could be fairly soon (2020), it will be one of the biggest art projects in the world, spanning well over a mile in length. His inspirations for the remarkable undertaking were the surrounding landscape, cities, industrial technology, minimalism, and the amazing ancient architecture found on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Heizer’s creation cost at least $25 million to build and is unviewable from outside the property lines. Back around 2015, some in the art community became very concerned that the land the installation sits on could be seized by the government or developed for far less creative purposes. They were not wrong in worrying about this. The region is increasingly being taken control of by the federal government as part of a long series of huge land grabs that have continued for decades . If that were to have occurred, the extremely long-term art project would likely never have a chance to be appreciated by the public. Even if the land the sculpture is a part of weren’t seized, but the area around it was developed in some significant way, some think it would have had a drastic impact on how the installation would be appreciated by visitors. Over the years, land in the desolate area has been eyed for many applications, including as a missile launch site, for various energy projects, and so-called ‘glow trains’ loaded with nuclear waste and destined for the Yucca Mountain repository would have literally run directly through the art project. Los Angeles County Museum Of Art’s director of executive communications, Scott Tennent, wrote the following in 2015: “City is Heizer’s magnum opus. Although it is not yet finished, images of City have circulated for decades. As with many of Heizer’s greatest works, the sculpture is incomplete without the surrounding landscape. The solitude of City is part of its power. To have the surrounding land developed into anything would severely impact Heizer’s work. To see the land developed into a site for military, energy, or waste purposes, would ruin it forever. After 43 years of work, can it really be destroyed like this?” Thankfully, in the summer of 2015, with the help of senior Nevada Senator Harry Reid, the Obama Administration used the 1906 antiquities Act to establish the art installation and a whopping 700,000 acres in the area as a National Monument. Reid visited the site and was blown away by its beauty and relevance before pushing to get it preserved. He stated the following about the unique work of art: “What Michael Heizer has done is about as visionary as anything that one can imagine… It’ll be there for a long time. It’s going to be there forever.” Like so many things in the area, this massive land-sculpture is bizarre, but for a much more inclusive and creative reason. Heizer is a master at what he does and looking at pictures of City, it is remarkable how well it captures the desolation and mystery of the terrain that surrounds it. It also has the potential to be the best filming set for futuristic movies and television shows ever devised. Hopefully, we will get a chance to take it all in once it is finally done, but in the meantime, we can say with confidence that there are no secret military projects or flying saucers located at the site.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 17, 2018",Russia Says It Would Happily Sell The Pentagon Ammo If It Weren’t For Those Pesky Sanctions,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s top state-owned industrial conglomerate, Rostec, says it would be more than happy to sell ammunition to the U.S. military for Soviet-style rifles and machine guns, such as the Kalashnikov AK family of rifles, if the United States would just lift the relevant sanctions. Every year, the U.S. Army buys significant quantities of these rounds, as well as the guns themselves, to support a host of requirements within the U.S. government, especially from special operations forces , and in order to supply such ordnance to American allies and partners abroad. A Rostec spokesperson made the comments to Russian state-run media outlet TASS on May 28, 2019. The statement came in direct response to a story on Defence Blog regarding a new Army contracting announcement regarding the service’s plan to hire contractors to supply an indefinite quantity of various types of ammunition associated with Soviet and Russian-type firearms between Fiscal Years 2021 and 2026. The prospective order would include, but is not limited to purchases of the ubiquitous 7.62x39mm round that various AK-style rifles and derivatives use, the 5.45x39mm cartridge for AK-74 rifles and derivatives, the PK-series light machine guns’ 7.62x54mm round, and the 12.7x108mm cartridge for DShK and other Russian-made heavy machine guns. The YaKB rotary-barrelled machine gun found on many variants of the iconic Hind gunship helicopter , among others , also uses the latter 12.7mm round. You can see all of the different rounds the Army wants as part of this particular contract below: US Army The Army acts as a central manager for the U.S. government purchases of these and other kinds of so-called “non-standard” ammunition, which simply means they are not in regular use within the U.S. military. U.S. military units, particularly special operations units, often train with foreign weapons that they might expect to find on deployments, either as part of training programs for foreign forces or as part of covert or clandestine activities that may require the use of weapons not typically associated with the United States. US Marine Corps Raiders fire AK-type rifles during a training exercise., USMC Troops assigned to perform the role of the “ opposing force ” during training exercises will often use foreign-made weapons to better reflect potential hostile forces and their capabilities. Intelligence entities also need access to this kind of ammunition as part of “ foreign materiel exploitation ” activities, or FME, to analyze the capabilities of captured weapons. Research and developmental work also demands foreign ammunition in order to test things such as individual and vehicle armor . Bulk purchases of non-standard ammunition support a wide variety of U.S. military assistance programs, as well. “Basic characteristics demonstrate that modern Russian ammunition is the world’s best,” Rostec’s spokesman boasted to TASS . “Original and high-quality Russian-made ammunition can be supplied to the United States only if relevant sanctions are lifted.” The claim that Russian-made ammunition is superior to all others is completely unfounded. However, it is worth noting that ammunition companies in Russia produce ammunition of a variety of quality levels, including brass-cased types with non-corrosive primers, just like their Western counterparts. Stereotypical lower-quality ammunition from Russian factories, much of which uses cheaper to manufacture steel cartridge cases, does not reflect the entirety of the country’s present-day ammunition production capabilities. An example of commercial, Russian-made steel-cased, but non-corrosive 7.62x54mm ammunition., Tulammo But Rostec isn’t wrong that U.S. government sanctions on the Kremlin and Russian-state owned enterprises have made it impossible for Russia’s ammunition manufacturers to bid on American military contracts. For years now, the United States has slapped the Kremlin and its associates with an increasing number of economic restrictions over the murder of journalists , Russia’s illegal seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region and active support for insurgents fighting the government in Kiev, Russian support for Syria’s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad, and the Kremlin’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, to name just a few inciting incidents . One of the most recent U.S. government actions came in 2017 when Congress passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ( CAASTA ), which targeted Russia, as well as Iran and North Korea. There have been concerns that CAASTA would lead to a total ban on the commercial sale of Russian-made ammunition, which is popular in the United States for its low price, but that has not occurred . In addition, at least one American distributor, Sporting Supplies International (SSI), which owns the well-known Wolf brand, had already stopped selling Russian-made rounds due to legal disputes . But Russia is hardly the only country in question to produce the ammunition the Army is looking to buy. As of 2015, the service was relying on Orbital ATK, now a division of Northrop Grumman, and Chemring to source the rounds through a network primarily of former Soviet bloc countries, including present-day NATO members, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria. New Jersey-based SSI, which today relies on various European suppliers itself, was also a subcontractor at that time. Another briefing slide showing the US Army’s non-standard ammunition supplier base, as of 2015., US Army A briefing slide showing the types of non-standard ammunition the US Army was buying for US military use and for foreign partners, as of 2015., US Army It’s an arrangement that certainly irks the Kremlin, which often accuses the U.S. government of actively trying to force it out of the international arms trade and keep it out of the lucrative American domestic firearms market. “This is unfair competition in its purest form,” a spokesperson for Russia’s state-run arms broker Rosoboronexport told Reuters in regards to American sanctions in April 2018. For example, a cloud of controversy continues to surround Florida-based Kalashnikov USA , which maintains it has no direct links to Russia’s Kalashnikov Concern , though the two previously had a deal to import Russian-made AK-style rifles into the United States. That arrangement collapsed after the imposition of certain U.S. sanctions in 2014 . The American firm is now looking to build rifles of this type domestically, but there are reports it is now under investigation for sanctions violations over the potential use of parts it has imported from Russia. The U.S. government now has a program that actively provides block grants to allies and partners specifically to support them in replacing Russian-made, as well as Chinese-produced, military equipment with American weaponry, as well. But, at least so far, this effort seems mainly focused on larger items, such as helicopters and armored personnel carriers, rather than small arms. That might change in the future. In October 2018, Rostec had responded angrily to reports that U.S. Special Operations Command was looking for a domestic source to make American analogs for the AK rifle family, the PKM light machine gun, and the NSV heavy machine gun, a project you can read about more here . Beyond Kalashnikov USA , there are already companies that build AK-pattern guns for the civilian market in the United States. Still, there’s no indication that those new weapons would stop using Soviet-style ammunition types. Even if American allies and partners abandoned all weapons using those calibers, it wouldn’t eliminate the need for non-standard ammunition supplies for realistic training, FME, and other developmental purposes, either. So, it looks as if the Army is set to continue buying this kind of ammunition for the foreseeable future. But unless U.S.-Russian relations dramatically change, however, it’s unlikely that Russian companies, especially those under the Rostec umbrella, will be fulfilling those orders any time soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 24, 2019",The Air Force Found Airmen Boozing It Up In A Nuclear Missile Alert Facility In Wyoming,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has slapped a pair of airmen with administrative punishments after discovering they were drinking inside a missile alert facility at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The base is home to some 150 LGM-30G Minuteman III nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, one of three ICBM fields that make up one leg of the United States’ nuclear deterrent triad. Task & Purpose got confirmation from the Air Force that the incident had occurred on May 14, 2019. Yesterday, an anonymous post citing an unnamed source on the popular unofficial Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook group claimed that three airmen from the 90th Maintenance Group had been involved in the incident at F.E. Warren’s Hotel Missile Alert Facility, but if that was the case only two of them have received formal disciplinary actions. “It appears there’s a running joke on the base about the incident and they even have memes going around which were sent for us to post,” the Facebook post, which you can read in full below, said. “They have deemed PBR as the Official beer of the 2019 Nuclear Missile Code Change at F.E. Warren AFB.” Joseph Coslett, the head of operations at the public affairs office for the 90th Missile Wing, which includes the 90th Maintenance Group and is the main unit at F.E. Warren, denied to Task & Purpose that the drinking had occurred during a change over in the nuclear codes at the alert facility, which happens regularly for security reasons. “An investigation, including admission by the airmen, revealed the two consumed the alcohol while in an off-duty status and were not in contact, nor had any access to weapons or classified material,” he said in a statement. It is possible that the drinking occurred around a code change, even if the individuals in question, a staff sergeant and a senior airman who the Air Force have not identified, did not have access to weapons or classified material at that exact time. The individuals were reportedly found drinking in an exercise room while “resting overnight” at the alert facility, which could have occurred after the reported nuclear code change. Staying overnight at the alert facility is not uncommon for personnel assigned to the Air Force’s missile wings. In order to force potential opponents to expend a significant number of their own nuclear warheads if they want to try to destroy the Minuteman fields, such as the one at F.E. Warren, a questionable concept that has led to the nickname “ America’s nuclear sponge ,” alert facilities and their associated silos are spread out over an extremely wide area. As such, it can take up to between three to four hours in certain cases to drive from the main portion of the base to certain alert facilities. An aerial view of a Missile Alert Facility at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, showing what is typically visible above ground., USAF Nuclear code changes at Minuteman bases are themselves a lengthy affair, which can take hours to complete even with an improved coding system Air Force missile units began using in 2017. You can read more about the code change process and the systems involved here . Regardless, the Air Force expressly prohibits drinking, even for individuals in an off-duty status, within missile alert facilities. This certainly seems like an entirely reasonable thing to do at a site responsible for controlling a dozen nuclear-armed missiles. It is still important to note that the actual underground launch control center is heavily segregated from other areas of a Missile Alert Facility. Members of the 90th Missile Wing inside an actual launch control center within a Missile Alert Facility., USAF “This is not a laughing matter,” Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook stressed. “In fact, the last time there was an incident during a Nuclear Code Change, there were investigations and changes in leadership.” F.E. Warren’s leadership is clearly of the same view as that anonymous poster. “This is an unacceptable breach of standards and the Air Force held the airmen accountable for their actions,” Coslett, the base’s top public affairs official, told Task & Purpose . Unfortunately, it’s hardly the first time the Air Force’s missileers have gotten in trouble over failing to adhere to procedures during nuclear code changes or received punishments over the use of various intoxicating substances. The Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook group noted that in 2008 , three officers at F.E. Warren fell asleep without first securing a system containing old nuclear launch codes. This latest boozy incident also comes less than a year after the Air Force acknowledged it had disciplined 14 airmen assigned to the 90th Missile Wing for using LSD, cocaine, and other drugs on various occasions between 2015 and 2016. All of this follows a string of particularly damning incidents within the Air Force’s missile units in 2013 and 2014, including the discovery of widespread cheating on proficiency tests among missileers at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. In October 2013, the service had also relieved Major General Michael Carey from command of the 20th Air Force, which is also headquartered at F.E. Warren and is in charge of the entire Minuteman III force, over drunken escapades in Russia during an official visit. This included fraternizing with two unvetted foreign national women, an obvious security risk. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NqZ9XvzFiqw This all prompted a major review of conditions within the missile force that uncovered worryingly low-morale among individuals who often saw assignments to Minuteman III units as a “ dead-end career .” It would seem that there is still something of a worrisome atmosphere within the ICBM community. Maybe its an even better time than we already think to reconsider whether the ICBM force is necessary at all , especially as the U.S. government looks to spend more than $100 billion to buy new missiles and to update the associated infrastructure that will support them.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This story is just developing, but weather radar data indicates that a tornado struck on or very near the south side of Wright Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio. This is where the National Museum Of The United States Air Force is located. Wright Patterson, in general, is an extremely important base. It is home of the USAF Materiel Command and a number of strategic airlifters, among many other tenants. It may be some time before we hear exactly what transpired as it is night in Ohio and more super-cells are barreling through the area as this post is being written. Massive storms are ravaging the region causing multiple states to be on high alert for potential tornado activity. There have already been 40 reports of tornadoes across five states in the Midwest and at least six of those tornados have already been confirmed. According to Michigan’s Channel 17 Fox affiliate “Many of the wind speeds on clocked on Doppler Radar velocity were in the neighborhood of 100 to 110 mph. Some of these tornadoes are likely to be classified at least an EF-1, with EF-2 quite likely.” Even if it missed Wright Patterson AFB, the area is heavily populated and a tornado touching down within the metropolitan area around Dayton could be devastating. The Air Force is already reeling from two separate major weather events that decimated nearly all of Tyndall AFB in Florida and badly flooded half of Offutt AFB in Nebraska. The damage done is now considered to be in the billions of dollars and this year’s hurricane, tornado, and fire seasons are just heating up.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 31, 2019","Multiple F/A-18 Pilots Disclose Recent UFOs Encounters, New Radar Tech Key In Detection","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a major breakthrough in what could be the most fascinating story of our time, five U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet crewmen have recounted a number of incredibly strange encounters with unidentified flying objects off the East Coast of the United States. Two of the pilots went on the record. The surreal craft they encountered had performance that defies known propulsion and aerodynamic capabilities, and are described as looking like something akin to special effects you would have seen in a sci-fi movie circa the late 1980s. The pilots’ accounts also point to a major sensor upgrade on their aircraft that made the presence of these craft even detectable at all. What’s even more important is that these events took place as recently as 2015, over a decade after the now famous Nimitz incident with the so-called ‘Tic Tac’ craft occurred. This is all coming to light—at least officially—just weeks after the U.S. Navy said it is changing its procedures for its service members reporting unexplained phenomenon in their operating environments. The War Zone had recently published an in-depth expose about the Navy’s procedural changes, a number of other revelations surrounding the Tic Tac incident, and more recent developments, that concluded that the phenomenon is indeed real. That hard to swallow fact has huge implications, regardless of the objects’ origins. Lt. Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been in the Navy for a decade has come forward after talking to the Navy and Congress about the events he and his squadron mates witnessed between 2014 and 2015. In a New York Times article published on May 26th, 2019, Graves described how strange craft would appear in their training airspace and persist there not for minutes, but many hours, or even days at a time. “These things would be out there all day… Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.” The persistence of these craft was in no way the strangest thing about them. Beyond being able to drop tens of thousands of feet in a matter of a second or two and possessing flight characteristics that are unobtainable with known technology, the unannounced visitors looked like nothing else on the planet. But before we get into all that, let’s rewind to how all this began and talk about a very important detail that was largely glazed over in the New York Times piece. Graves and another pilot who was willing to disclose his identity—Lt. Danny Accoin—were both Naval Aviators serving in Navy Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), the Red Rippers, based out of Naval Air Station Oceana near Norfolk, Virginia. Strange anomalies started showing up on their Super Hornets’ radars in 2014, while they were out on training maneuvers in the vast warning areas off the Atlantic Coast between Virginia and Florida. You can see the massive warning and military operating areas that lay off the southeastern seaboard of the United States. All of those large dashed boxes are areas that can be restricted for military training. These swathes of ocean and sky are critical to national security as they let aircraft, and vessels in some cases, operate far from the civilian population in a similar manner as they would on deployment. This includes flying at supersonic speeds for fighter aircraft and using powerful sensors and electronic warfare gear that may interfere with daily life near populated areas., Skyvector.com According to Graves, Naval Aviators really began noticing the objects in their training areas after a major technological leap in air combat capability was fielded across much of the U.S. Navy’s combat aircraft inventory. It’s a technology that isn’t detailed in the New York Times’ report, but one we talk about here constantly at The War Zone— Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars. Before the mid-2000s, Navy tactical fighter aircraft were equipped with mechanically scanned array (MSA) pulse doppler radar systems of varying capabilities and power outputs. So-called ‘legacy’ F/A-18AC/D Hornets were largely equipped with the AN/APG-73 radar. This was a very capable MSA fire control radar with multiple air-to-air, air-to-ground, and synthetic aperture ground mapping modes. Still, it was developed based on 1980s technology, as the vast majority of the fighter radars in service with U.S. military aircraft were at the time. AN/APG-73 MSA radar on a legacy Hornet., Raytheon Even the earlier batches of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets delivered in the first half of the 2000s were equipped with this same radar set. But as production of the Super Hornet matured, the AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar was installed in place of the AN/APG-73. It became operational on a handful of Super Hornets in 2007, with the number of Navy fighters equipped with it slowing growing larger ever since. Today, it is commonplace across the Navy’s Super Hornet and Growler fleets. Also, a diverse array of older aircraft, including the legacy Hornet and even the B-52 Stratofortress , are now being back-fitted with modular AESA radar sets, breathing new life into older airframes. The AN/APG-79, and other AESA radars like it on fighter aircraft, offer a huge leap in capability in virtually every respect. This included a massive improvement in reliability as a steerable radar dish is no longer needed with electronically scanned arrays. Mechanically scanned arrays have to quickly sweep in all directions physically and even under heavy G forces and buffeting, and they have to survive crashing down on a carrier deck after missions over and over. So, migrating to a system with few moving parts was a massive coup in terms of reliability for Navy fighters. The AN/APG-79 installed on a Super Hornet. , US Navy via Researchgate.net In addition to better readiness, and more importantly, the AN/APG-79’s resolution, range, speed of scan, simultaneous tracking, and target discrimination abilities are drastically improved over its predecessor. Even the ability to operate in air-to-air and air-to-ground modes at the same time has been introduced. In addition, advanced software and processing that interprets what the more sensitive radar ‘sees’ provides a higher quality end product to Super Hornet crews, resulting in dramatically improved situational awareness. All this means that AESA equipped fighters can see farther, better understand what was being detected, and have a hugely enhanced ability to see detect objects flying low over surface clutter. Even small or low observable (stealthy), or slow-moving targets, or those that attempt to hide in the ‘doppler notch’ of a threatening fighter’s radar by flying perpendicular to it, have a tougher time eluding detection and engagement when facing opposition fighters packing AESA radar sets. With all that being said, apparently, this same leap in sensor technology also lifted the curtain, so to speak, when it came to detecting UFOs flying near Navy fighters while on training missions. The New York Times writes: The pilots began noticing the objects after their 1980s-era radar was upgraded to a more advanced system. As one fighter jet after another got the new radar, pilots began picking up the objects, but ignoring what they thought were false radar tracks. “People have seen strange stuff in military aircraft for decades,” Lieutenant Graves said. “We’re doing this very complex mission, to go from 30,000 feet, diving down. It would be a pretty big deal to have something up there.” But he said the objects persisted, showing up at 30,000 feet, 20,000 feet, even sea level. They could accelerate, slow down and then hit hypersonic speeds. Lieutenant Accoin said he interacted twice with the objects. The first time, after picking up the object on his radar, he set his plane to merge with it, flying 1,000 feet below it. He said he should have been able to see it with his helmet camera, but could not, even though his radar told him it was there. A few days later, Lieutenant Accoin said a training missile on his jet locked on the object and his infrared camera picked it up as well. “I knew I had it, I knew it was not a false hit,” he said. But still, “I could not pick it up visually.” At this point the pilots said they speculated that the objects were part of some classified and extremely advanced drone program. But then pilots began seeing the objects. In late 2014, Lieutenant Graves said he was back at base in Virginia Beach when he encountered a squadron mate just back from a mission “with a look of shock on his face.” He said he was stunned to hear the pilot’s words. “I almost hit one of those things,” the pilot told Lieutenant Graves. The pilot and his wingman were flying in tandem about 100 feet apart over the Atlantic east of Virginia Beach when something flew between them, right past the cockpit. It looked to the pilot, Lieutenant Graves said, like a sphere encasing a cube. The last part is somewhat mind-blowing. Basically, he describes a geometric cube with a translucent sphere of some sort around it. Like I said in the opening of this piece, this sounds like some special effects object from season one of S tar Trek The Next Generation , not a craft being reported in detail from a highly-trained Navy fighter pilot that flew right by it. Apparently, others appeared to be spinning in mid-air like tops and were captured by the Super Hornet’s AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR targeting pod. The now famous ‘gimbal video’ was supposedly recorded on one of the Red Rippers’ training missions: After this near miss, the Red Rippers were officially spooked. What was something of a novelty and mystery, became a flight safety issue. They filed an official safety report. The New York Times continues: The near miss, he and other pilots interviewed said, angered the squadron, and convinced them that the objects were not part of a classified drone program. Government officials would know fighter pilots were training in the area, they reasoned, and would not send drones to get in the way. “It turned from a potentially classified drone program to a safety issue,” Lieutenant Graves said. “It was going to be a matter of time before someone had a midair” collision. What was strange, the pilots said, was that the video showed objects accelerating to hypersonic speed, making sudden stops and instantaneous turns — something beyond the physical limits of a human crew. “Speed doesn’t kill you,” Lieutenant Graves said. “Stopping does. Or acceleration.” Asked what they thought the objects were, the pilots refused to speculate. We have helicopters that can hover,” Lieutenant Graves said. “We have aircraft that can fly at 30,000 feet and right at the surface.” But “combine all that in one vehicle of some type with no jet engine, no exhaust plume.” Lieutenant Accoin said only that “we’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths.” The squadron deployed to the Middle East in March of 2015, and according to the pilots interviewed, the encounters off of the southeastern coast of the U.S. ended not long after. As for the Navy’s strange public announcement that they were changing the reporting procedures for these types of encounters, their position is the same as it was weeks ago, with the New York Times quoting Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher as such: “There were a number of different reports,” he said. Some cases could have been commercial drones, he said, but in other cases “we don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.” Red Ripper F/A-18F., USN We examined this peculiar move by the Navy and the odd timing of it in great detail in my last article on the subject, and this series of events likely had something to do with it. Regardless, with all this in mind, what can we take away from these new on the record revelations? First off, they are a huge deal. We are talking about two more Navy fighter pilots on the record and another three talking to The New York Times on background. And this was not some account that occurred a decade or more in the past, this was just a couple years ago. Yet what strikes me the most is that once again, this series of encounters occurred in tightly sanitized airspace over the ocean where the military does its most advanced and complex training and testing, just like the Nimitz’s Tic Tac incident many years earlier on the west coast. In that case, the gear and personnel involved were also preparing for a major deployment. Yet what the New York Times doesn’t seem to firmly drill down on enough is that we are now getting first-hand accounts that describe a major upgrade in radar technology as being a catalyst for actually detecting and tracking these mysterious objects. Much of my last piece was dedicated to the little known fact that back in 2004, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was executing very complex and highly integrated training prior to deployment with Cooperative Engagement Capability technology installed on its ships and aircraft. This was the first time this game-changing suite of sensor fusion and data-link technologies was ever integrated into an operational Carrier Strike Group. As a result, multiple accounts definitively state that its unique, ‘fused’ sensor data was confiscated after the Tic Tac incident culminated in a number of close encounters. Taking the recent information about the radar upgrade on the Super Hornets into account, it adds a new facet of plausibility to the Nimitz /Tic Tac events. The higher fidelity radar telemetry data Cooperative Engagement Capability provided, like the introduction of AESA fire control radars on Navy fighters not long after, may have allowed for the detection and documentation of these objects like never before. Whether that was by design or by chance remains unknown. These two facts—the encounters occurring in secure military airspace off the continental U.S. coastline and the presence of advanced, highly capable radar systems in both series of incidents—is compelling, to say the least. As we stated in our last piece on the subject, these areas and the gear present in them during the encounters would make for very attractive testing conditions for undisclosed aerial capabilities. When it comes to the object’s strange appearance, making something as alien looking as possible is probably a good thing for deniability and unconventional camouflage purposes. Even the testing of sensors under real-world conditions against such a craft using various guises could be beneficial. As for near collisions, they have happened among military aircraft operating in highly controlled airspace where both parties are being helped by air traffic controllers. As such, the near miss doesn’t seem like an outright disqualifier for these objects belonging to the military, or a military, as the pilots seem to think. And it’s not like the presence of totally unknown aircraft that could be a threat to the safety of other aircraft hasn’t occurred even in highly trafficked airspace that is patrolled by alert fighter aircraft. We have broken three major stories about just that in just the last 18 months, one of which is unprecedented in its level of documentation . I do have to stress that this is not the explanation we are giving for these incidents, but it is one that has to be taken into account, especially considering the similar circumstances at hand. General knowledge of the aforementioned events that occurred off the east coast in 2014 and 2015 is not necessarily new. Many of us who have kept very close tabs on these developments have known about the sphere and cube craft description for some time, and that a number of encounters happened in this area long after the Nimitz event in 2004. Our good friend Danny Silva reported on the broad strokes of this story days before the New York Times piece was published via dissecting an interview with Commander David Fravor, the lead Super Hornet pilot that had the close-up encounter with the Tic Tac in 2004. Silva also blogged about Fravor’s description of what the east coast pilots saw back in January . What is new is the level of detail offered and the fact that five pilots talked to The New York Times about this and two were on the record. NAS Oceana is one of two Navy master strike fighter bases, the other being NAS Lemoore in central California. Many squadrons call NAS Oceana home. It would be suprising to hear that these encounters happened with the Red Rippers alone. In addition, multiple huge Marine Corps and USAF bases are also located in the region and use the same airspace. , Google Earth The fact of the matter is that we still don’t know much about these strange events. For instance, was this a community-wide event? In other words, were multiple squadrons at NAS Oceana experiencing similar incidents? The AN/APG-79 was fairly common by 2015 among Super Hornet units. If not, why only the Red Rippers? They are just one of many fighter squadrons based at NAS Oceana—along with dozens of other Marine Corps and USAF Squadrons based in the region—that also use the airspace for training. Some of those units are equipped with more advanced aircraft types than the Super Hornet, such as the F-35 and F-22. These aircraft also have AESA radars. Did they spot similar phenomena during this period of time? In addition, why did it take a near miss to report the presence of these craft? Was it a cultural and professional issue, or something else? Now stepping back even further, it is very interesting we are hearing of this now. The steady drip, drip, drip of information starting with the disclosure of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) in December of 2017 has been peculiar, bordering on downright questionable, to say the least. It is also just days before To The Stars Academy, the quasi-research/entertainment corporation put together by Blink 182 rocker Tom DeLonge and now filled with impressive resumes from the intelligence and aerospace sectors, including the ex-head of the AATIP program, has the first episode of its highly touted new program on the History Channel premiere. You can read more about the strange circumstances surrounding these disclosures in my last piece on the topic. Regardless, this report moves the ball forward in a major way and underscores, once again, the reality that the limits of aerospace engineering and propulsion, at least as we understand them, have been exceeded by someone or something. As I wrote last month: The main revelation is that technology exists that is capable of performing flying maneuvers that shatter our perceptions of propulsion, flight controls, material science, and even physics. Let me underline this again for you, the Nimitz encounter with the Tic Tac proved that exotic technology that is widely thought of as the domain of science fiction actually exists. It is real . It isn’t the result of altered perception, someone’s lucid dream, a stray weather balloon, or swamp gas. Someone or something has crossed the technological Rubicon and has obtained what some would call the Holy Grail of aerospace engineering. This reality is very hard to process for many. There is always an out for some in the form of claiming an odd impromptu conspiracy or some hollow explanation that doesn’t pass muster beyond the first paragraph, but in the end, it happened. As uncomfortable as that fact is, it’s reality. So, we need to use this event as a lodestar going forward when it comes to evaluating and contemplating what is possible and where truth actually lies. We are working this story from multiple and highly unique angles. Stay tuned for some truly exciting developments.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 22, 2019",The Air Force Can’t Say What It Plans To Do With Its Retired B-2 Bombers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s new B-21 Raider stealth bomber is steadily moving closer to entering production and eventually replacing the existing B-2 Spirits . At the same time, with plans to have all of the older flying wing bombers retired within 15 years , the service will have to figure out soon how it will store or dispose of those aircraft in a way that is practical, safe, secure, and meets the demands of any existing or future arms control deals . At present, the Air Force has 20 B-2 bombers and all but one of these are situated at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. At any one time, only a fraction of the small fleet is ready for operational missions. But if the B-21 program remains on schedule , the B-2 fleet should begin heading into retirement in the late 2020s and could be completely out of service by 2032, per an official “ bomber vector ” plan that emerged publicly in February 2018. “At this time it is too early in the process to discuss the future disposition of the B-2,” Linda Frost, a spokesperson for Air Force Global Strike Command told The War Zone in an Email. “It’s too premature to publicly release anything [about any retirement plans] at this time.” AFGSC oversees all of the Air Force’s bombers, including the B-1 , B-2, and B-52 , and will take control of the B-21s when they enter service. We also reached out to the public affairs office for the 309th Aerospace Maintenance And Regeneration Group (AMARG), which oversees the U.S. military’s main aircraft boneyard at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. They told us that AFGSC would lead any planning for how to divest the bombers in the future. One of the Air Force’s 20 B-2 bombers., USAF But if the Air Force has not actually begun working out a plan for what it will do with the B-2s, or done so already, it will have to start doing so soon. Depending on a variety of factors, the service may not be able to put these planes literally “out to pasture” in the desert at Davis-Monthan as it has done with a host of other aircraft types in the past. The B-2’s highly sensitive construction alone could create demands for added physical security. Even though it took its first flight in 1989 and was in development years before that, the B-2 and details about many of its stealthy features and other components remain highly classified. Aspects of the aircraft remain so secret that members of the media have been banned from taking photographs of the rear of the plane. As such, the Air Force will have to ensure that wherever it decides to store the B-2s, even temporarily, makes it difficult, if not impossible for spies, thieves, or just aviation geeks , to break in. This could also preclude sending the aircraft off to U.S. government-run or third party museums without significant work to remove classified equipment and other features. To put F-117 Nighthawk stealth jets on display, the Air Force has had to put them through an arduous process to remove the aircraft’s toxic radar-absorbent coating , as well as pulling out any still-sensitive mission systems and modifying certain structures on the airframe itself. The B-2 test article at National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, serial number AT-1000, which carries the same markings as the operational B-2, serial number 82-1070, which also has the nickname “The Spirit of Ohio.”, USAF It’s also worth noting that the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force already has a non-flyable B-2 test article in its exhibit halls that required a lot of modification to make it safe to display. They might not be interested in even taking another airframe unless they can find a new home for the existing one first. A small number of others might go to other high profile American aviation museums, such as the National Air and Space Museum’s annex near Dulles Airport in Virginia, if it is even feasible. But the service will have to devise a plan for what to do with the remaining aircraft. Still, this isn’t the first time the Air Force has had to contend with these sorts of logistical issues with a particularly sensitive type. When it officially retired the F-117s in 2008, the service initially put them into storage at the secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport rather than at the main boneyard. An F-117 Nighthawk., USAF “Priority Level (PL) 3 security had been mandated for the stored fighters, requiring double lines of fencing, double the normal degree of surveillance, Special Access Required (SAR) clearances for all having access to the aircraft, and other extreme security measures,” according to an official Air Force history we previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. “The logical repository for the F-117, the AMARG, lacked the security resources required under PL 3, thus the selection of the Nevada facility.” Even Tonopah, which had hosted the F-117 during its top-secret early operational period, and already had state-of-the-art security features , needed substantial improvements to take on this new mission. The Air Force spent more than $2 million upgrading the site ahead of the Nighthawk’s retirement, a process that took more than a year to complete. It’s not clear if the B-2s will require such stringent security, though. The remaining F-117s are in so-called Type 1000 storage , which requires they receive a certain amount of regular maintenance and other checkups so that they can return to active service on relatively short notice if necessary. Most of the aircraft ended up packed four to a hangar with their wings off to help consolidate space and save money. A handful, said to be around six aircraft, remained in flyable condition . Five wingless F-117s share a hangar at Tonopah., USAF We don’t know how much of the cost of improving the facilities at Tonopah was related to the Type 1000 storage requirements versus the need to add PL 3 security features. In addition, the demands of semi-active storage for aircraft still wearing their radar-absorbent coatings and carrying various mission equipment and avionics might have driven the need for the increased physical security. There is no indication that the Air Force has any desire to put the very costly to operate B-2s in Type 1000 storage given the maintenance costs associated with doing so and that the aircraft could end up competing for resources with the new B-21s. So, it might be easier for the service to store the Spirits, even temporarily, out in the open at Tonopah, another similar highly controlled site, or even at the boneyard at Davis Monthan under certain circumstances. B-2 in the coating facility., Northrop Grumman That being said, it was Congress that mandated the service put the F-117s into this inactive reserve status through the 2017 fiscal year. There is always the possibility, albeit remote, that lawmakers might make similar demands to maintain the older stealth bombers, at least until the Raiders have arrived in sufficient numbers and proven themselves capable of performing their missions. And if the demands for PL 3 security features to guard the F-117s were at all independent of the Type 1000 storage requirements, then the B-2s could need similar security improvements wherever they end up in the future. Of course, if the Air Force succeeds in retiring the bombers for good, they will almost certainly have them stripped of their radar-absorbing material coatings, which will at least obviate the need for the aircraft to sit in costly climate-controlled hangars. If all of their sensitive components are removed as well, it may be possible to store them at AMARG, but just the complex radar-evading structure of B-2, what lies underneath its smooth skin, is deemed highly senistive. A B-2 sits on the flightline at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam with an F/A-18 Hornet to the left and a pair of F-16 Vipers on the right., USAF If the air force doesn’t want to store any of the B-2s that don’t make it to museums, if any actually do, the alternative would be to physically destroy them. This process would come with its own complexities as it would have to be sufficient to prevent anyone from being able to recover any sensitive material. Again, the service could look to its experience with the F-117 for guidance. In August 2008, Lockheed Martin destroyed a developmental YF-117, serial number 79-0784. This plane wouldn’t fit in storage at Tonopah and the Air Force deemed it to have no “historical significance.” The goal was reportedly to test an effective method for disposing of the aircraft, should it come to that, but the exact reason for and results of the experiment remain murky. When I asked about the test in 2015, Air Force officials at the 309th AMARG and Air Force Materiel Command could not offer any additional details beyond what was already publicly available. Workers destroy YF-117, serial number 79-0784, in 2008. Lockheed Martin employees have already stripped the plane of its radar-absorbent coating., USAF Our own Tyler Rogoway, then writing for Foxtrot Alpha, heard from his own sources in 2014 that the Air Force was considering pulling the F-117s out of Type 1000 status and just burying them in pieces at Tonopah, which would offer a relatively simple way to free up space at that base and cut costs, while also limiting the possibility of any nefarious actors being able to glean anything from the airframes. More recently, when it passed the annual defense budget for the 2017 fiscal year in December 2016, Congress approved plans to allow the Air Force to begin removing the Nighthawks from storage and fully retiring them at a rate of four every year beginning in 2018. The Air Force also expected to divest one in 2017. An F-117 was spotted last year being trucked to an undisclosed location as part of this process. It still isn’t clear what will come of the F-117s, but the service’s plan to complete its divestment of these aircraft will very likely be an indicator of what’s to come for the B-2 following its retirement. Though the B-2s would almost certainly have shed their radar-absorbent coatings by then, this could still create its own problems owing to the potentially toxic materials that make up the airframe and other components within. Destroying the aircraft and throwing them in pits could lead to heavy metals and carcinogens leaching into the groundwater or otherwise presenting a health hazard to personnel on whatever base houses the odd graves or individuals in surrounding communities . This issue could be particularly pronounced since concerns about hazardous levels of lead and other substances have recently cropped up at dozens of U.S. military facilities. Whatever responsibility the Pentagon ultimately admits to in these various cases, it seems hard to believe that these controversies won’t impact any plans that involve destroying and disposing of the B-2s. The Air Force has been faced with at least some of these questions in the past, too. In 2008, a Spirit crashed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. In 2010, another one of the bombers suffered a major fire requiring extensive work to get it back into service. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YNnM_8WahcQ We don’t know what happened to the wreckage of the 2008 crash, but the Air Force would have had to have disposed of it in such a way that limited the chances that someone could recover any meaningful material and minimized the chance of future health hazards. There similarly would have had to have been protocols in place to manage the immediate impact and aftermath of the release of hazardous fumes during the subsequent fire. But perhaps most complicated and difficult to manage will be retiring the B-2s into permanent or temporary storage, or destroying them, in such a way that fulfills the U.S. government’s obligations under the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START , with Russia, or any future such agreements. New START, which will expire unless renewed in 2021, sets firm limits on the total number of nuclear-capable bombers the U.S. military can deploy at any one time and how many it can have in total. This could already cause significant difficulties for the Air Force’s plan to retire the B-2s in general, which we at The War Zone have explored in detail . The service will have to either store them in such a way that they effectively cannot return to service or destroy them if it doesn’t want to have to count the bombers toward the total number of delivery platforms as outlined under New START. The B-2 force enjoys custom hangars for each jet at Whiteman AFB, which will be prime real estate for the B-21 when it enters service. The base can accommodate at least double the stealth bomber force that is currently based there.  , USAF Per the treaty, the Air Force would also almost certainly have to allow Russian inspectors into whatever site houses the bombers at least once so that they can verify for themselves that the aircraft are non-functional. Russia would probably also demand an opportunity to observe any subsequent physical destruction of the aircraft to ensure that the process is total and irreversible, too. After the United States and the Soviet Union signed the original START in 1991, the Air Force stripped the usable parts from 365 B-52G bombers and then used a massive guillotine with a 13,000-pound blade to chop the aircraft into five separate pieces. The service then arranged the parts in such a way in the boneyard in Arizona that Soviet satellites could see them from space. This verification method limited the need for Soviet inspectors to physically visit the facility to confirm the destruction of the aircraft. It’s not clear if destroying the aircraft out in the open would necessarily be a viable option in this case for safety and security reasons. Of course, it is possible that New START will have expired before this becomes an issue. Even if the United States and Russia agree to extend it, the two countries will have to negotiate a new arrangement after 2026, which is well before the last B-2s are slated to go into retirement. There’s no guarantee this will happen, either. American and Russian officials are increasingly at odds over a host of other arms control agreements. Google Earth These include the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE), and the Open Skies Treaty . The Kremlin has also been critical to the U.S. government’s abandonment of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002 and the U.S. military’s subsequent development of ballistic missile defenses in Europe and elsewhere , even though these systems do not have the ability to challenge Russia’s nuclear deterrent capabilities . Another B-2 bomber., USAF If the arms control issues do evaporate, the Air Force will still be left with serious questions about how it plans to get rid of the B-2s or store them away if it so decides. But any decision the service chooses will include significant costs.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 15, 2019",US Army Says It Badly Needs A Scout Helicopter After Junking The Ones It Had,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The US Army has executed its grand rotary-wing aviation restructuring plan that saw the ousting of hundreds of Bell JetRanger derivatives from service— 653 airframes in total . These included the Army’s entire fleet of 187 TH-67 Creek primary trainers and the roughly 340 OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed reconnaissance/armed scout helicopters that performed so brilliantly in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, just months after the final Kiowa Warriors were officially retired, the US Army is whining about how badly they need…an armed scout helicopter. OH-58D Kiowa Warriors with the 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, conduct their final flight on April 15th, 2016. , US Army Under the same aviation plan, the OH-58D was partially “replaced” by far more complex and expensive AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters and drones , with the hopes that the Apache-drone teaming would work like a charm. Well the concept is still floundering, and clearly it cannot replace the efficiency or capability that the Kiowa Warrior provided. Not just that, but the plan also has seen entry-level Army helicopter pilots being taught to fly on $5 million twin turbine medium utility helicopters—the equivalent of running a drivers ed classes in a brand new Lexus SUV. The Army’s bumbling of the often step-child like but highly effective armed scout helicopter program and community is nothing new. The service has failed to field a OH-58D replacement for nearly a decade and a half. Before its cancellation in 2004, the cutting-edge and stealthy RAH-66 Comanche was supposedly going to fill the role and more. Then the Army went for a far lower-end replacement with the ARH-70 Arapaho program that also failed after costs spiraled out of control and developmental issues persisted. ARH-70, based on the Bell 407, before the program’s cancellation in 2008., US Army In between these programs the Army kicked the tires on many other armed reconnaissance helicopter concepts, but none made it very far. Even upgrading the OH-58D significantly was a touch-and-go affair before the type was suddenly axed entirely. By the turn of the decade it looked as if the Kiowa Warrior would get its first major facelift in over two decades in the form of the OH-58F program. The upgraded Kiowa Warrior first flew in 2013 and it was planned to reach initial operating capability in 2016, with the entire fleet of OH-58Ds being slated for the upgrade. The type would fly in “Foxtrot” form till at least 2036, but likely even beyond. Then the end came as the Army enacted its rotary-wing aviation restructuring plan, and the Kiowa’s proud service came to a fairly abrupt and unglamorous end. OH-58F prototype., US Army During this year’s Army Aviation Association of America convention, Army aviation officials stressed that the biggest gap in capability they have is the one left by the Kiowa Warrior’s quick retirement, and that they are seeking to fill that gap as a top priority. As it previously sat, the Army wouldn’t be able to replace the Kiowa Warrior anytime soon, as the service remained focused on developing and procuring a scalable family of new helicopter systems dubbed Future Vertical Lift. According to Aviation Week , under the program, which seeks to employ a new form of high-speed vertical lift capability across the services, there are five levels of aircraft that could be procured. Capability Set One (CS1) being a light helicopter, all the way up to Capability Set Five (CS5) being a heavy lift cargo aircraft. In the center is CS3, which will theoretically become the replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk and the AH-64 Apache, and also possibly the USMC’s UH-1 and AH-1 fleets, among other helicopters. Currently this part of the FVL is the highest priority overall for the program, and CS3 isn’t scheduled to be procured till around 2030 —if the funds for such a large force featuring capabilities that are currently deemed as “exotic” materializes. Both Sikorsky-Boeing, with their pusher-prop X-2 and S-97 Raider derived configuration dubbed the SB-1 Defiant, and Bell with their revised tiltrotor setup dubbed the V-280 Valor are the primary competitors vying for what could be the most high-stakes helicopter competition of a generation. Although both types are CS3 aircraft, it’s the “densest” category of the FVL lot when it comes to potential airframe sales. So the winning technology for CS3 is likely to factor in heavily, if not totally when it comes to the Pentagon’s decisions on other FVL capability set needs. A flight demonstration phase will begin by the end of the decade with both the V-280 and SB-1 airframes acting as competing technology demonstrators. V-280 Valor rendering., Bell But the Army now seems to being interested in pushing forward with a CS1 design on its own, possibly outside the official multi-service JVL program. The Sikorsky S-97 Raider was originally viewed as yet another possible successor to the OH-58D—that is before sequestration hit. It is currently in flight testing and offers many additional capabilities that the OH-58D didn’t—such as the ability to haul six troops into combat—and in some ways, it would even eclipse the utility of the AH-64 Apache for a portion of the Army’s more kinetically oriented missions. Its speed gives it enhanced survivability, faster response times to emergency troops in contact calls, superior anti-access capabilities and enhanced sortie rates among other benefits. It is even rumored to have some low observable features, although it can’t be considered a “stealth” aircraft. Army officials state that affordability must key if they are going to move forward and try to fill the hole left by the OH-58D in the not so distant future. This is somewhat of a laughable concept considering the service basically threw away hundreds of economical helicopters they already owned outright which were still capable of the armed scout mission. Nonetheless, while FVL will highly depend on scalability across as many services as possible for each aircraft capability set category cooperatively procured—for instance would the USMC want a CS2 or CS3 design to replace their attack helicopters, and if they go for a lighter and cheaper CS2 aircraft, maybe the US Army would follow suit—an Army armed scout replacement initiative would likely travel on its own vertical track. This way there would be no need for a “wait and see” mentality in regards to finding out other services’ needs and wishes, or for FVL to mature as a program at all. As a result, if the funding materializes, an armed scout helicopter replacement could happen relatively quickly. But once again, getting the funding to do so is about as big of an if as it gets right now. AH-64 and OH-58D over Iraq., US Army All this seems to be happening with little reflection as to what caused this capability gap in the first place. Specifically that it was partially self imposed as part of a highly questionable scheme that many predicted would end exactly how it has—with a glaring capability gap. If the Kiowa Warriors were kept and given some focused upgrades so that they could last even another decade, a replacement could have been procured based on far more mature FVL associated technologies. Not just that, but the Army would not be flying a fleet of twin engine utility UH-72 Lakota helicopters as trainers, nor would they need to have procured 100 more to augment the 87 existing airframes that were ordered to be ported over to the training role as part of the plan. The UH-72 is now laughably the Army’s primary trainer at Fort Rucker. , DoD Supposedly there have been some minor benefits associated with using the UH-72 for the training mission, but it seems very unlikely they outweigh the high cost of procuring and operating these relatively large and complex helicopters in such a basic role. Really, the Army could have executed other parts of its rotary-wing restructuring program—which included moving attack helicopters from the Guard to the active force, and Black Hawks from the active force to the Guard—while leaving the OH-58 and TH-67 alone. Additionally, if the Pentagon and the services under its purview would finally grow up and look at their assets in a holistic manner, a portion of the UH-72s could have been ported over to the USAF to replace its relatively ancient UH-1N missile tenders and VIP helicopters. In fact, the same 87 airframes sent to Fort Rucker to provide training, probably would have done the trick. The upside to all this is that if the Army could come up with some serious funds to procure a new advanced armed scout helicopter, Sikorsky has been self-funding development of the S-97 raider for years, so the Army would be stepping in later in the Raider’s development process than it would have otherwise. And if given the chance, the aircraft could even prove itself so indispensable that it may even be able to pull from other Army aviation budget pales, including the traditionally highly guarded funds set aside for its attack helicopter force. The company is already working on different configurations for the S-97 via a series of kits. They are also examining the possibility of an unmanned and stealthy Raider drone., Sikorsky Special Operations Command (SOCOM) could also potentially get involved with the S-97 program if “big Army” blazes the way. The type seems extremely well suited for the intense demands of the famed 160th Special Operations Air Regiment (SOAR), and could partially or fully replace the MH-6 and AH-6 Little Bird , as well as the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator. The more participation in the program the more the unit cost could decline and it could also actually lower risk for the Future Vertical Lift program in the coming decade as a byproduct. MH-60L DAP, US Army On the other hand, even though it is unlikely, the US Army could very well go for a far lower-cost, off-the-shelf solution just to get the armed scout mission back in its portfolio. The highly mature AH-6i, a militarized MD530F derivative , that has seen export success would be able to fill the role in a very low-risk and low-cost manner. By procuring the AH-6i, the Army would be able to field a platform with hard hitting-Hellfire missile capability at a fraction of the cost of an Apache. Not just that, but the helicopter can carry many types of stores and execute many other roles, from intelligence gathering to liaison duties. With the advent of highly accurate but compact laser-guided rocket , a small helicopter like this, or even the retired OH-58D, can now feature a deeper precision guided weapons magazine than ever thought possible. In retrospect it is sad the OH-58D never got to leverage this new weapons capability, it would have likely given the humble chopper new worth. Above all else, the AH-6i would give the Army a cheap, easily forward deployable reconnaissance helicopter that can hit hard when called upon. All without the heavy logistical footprint of the far more complex and expensive Apache. Then, in a decade and a half, once FVL has matured, the Army can look toward fielding a far more elaborate armed scout asset if it still wants to.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",Navy Wants Experimental Squadron Of Surface Ships To Explore New Tactics And Tech,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy is looking to stand up a new surface development squadron as early as this year that would help determine the most practical use of the service’s watered-down Zumwalt -class destroyers , something we at The War Zone have been suggesting could happen for years now . This new unit would also support “aggressive experimentation” with regards to the roles and missions of other surface ships and other craft, including the chronically underperforming Littoral Combat Ships , the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers , and Sea Hunter unmanned surface vessels. Depending on its final structure, this unit might become a permanent home for some of these vessels and would support the development of new types in the future, such as the Navy’s future guided missile frigate . U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Rich Brown, who is presently both Commander, Naval Surface Forces and head of the Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, offered new details about the experimental squadron at the Surface Navy Association’s main annual conference on Jan. 15, 2019. The service has been considering creating this unit since at least 2017 and would help fill the gap left by the shuttering of the Surface Warfare Development Group in 2012. “I think now is the time, again, to have a Surface Development Squadron where we can take risk where it makes sense and go out there, try things and see if it works, and if it doesn’t then oh well, try something else,” Brown explained, according to USNI News . “That’s my vision for the Surface Development Squadron.” At present, the Navy relies primarily on the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center ( SMWDC ) in San Diego for the development of new tactics, techniques, and procedures and experimenting with different operational concepts for the service’s surface warfare fleets. This organization also sends Warfare Tactics Instructors (WTI) to help support operational commands and to conduct experiments and assessments with the ships assigned to those units. USS Zumwalt ., USN An official Navy news story from December 2018 offers a good description of how the Center performs its mission at present: “Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center’s (SMWDC) WTI program trains high-performing junior officers in advanced tactics and Surface Warfare expertise before they are placed in production tours where they plan and support advanced tactical training exercises, develop doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and provide operational support. After these tours they return to the fleet to increase the lethality and tactical proficiency of the Surface Fleet by infusing their knowledge and experience within the watch teams they support and lead.” But this is a process that is, by definition, dependent on the availability and deployment schedule of operational ships. While the Navy says the exact structure and mission of the proposed Surface Development Squadron, or SURFRON, is still getting ironed out, Vice Admiral Brown has described it as being more akin to existing naval air development squadrons and Submarine Development Squadron Five (DEVRON 5). These units have their own organic aircraft and submarines to work with, respectively. The Seawolf -class USS Jimmy Carter , flying a pirate flag, indicating a successfully completed mission , returns to Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in 2017., USN “Where do you experiment? How do you integrate [new manned and unmanned ships] into strike group operations?” Brown asked rhetorically. “What better place to have the Surface Development Squadron than to do that.” This new surface unit could prove to be especially useful for finding a way to leverage the unique capabilities of the Zumwalts . After a protracted saga that you can read about in more depth here , the Navy eventually decided to purchase just three of these advanced stealth destroyers and has been struggling to find suitable missions for these low-density assets ever since. On Jan. 27, 2019, the service commissioned the second of these ships, the USS Michael Mansoor . The Navy’s goal is to commission the last ship, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , by the end of this year. Sailors fire a 19-gun salute during the commissioning ceremony for the USS Michael Mansoor on Jan. 27, 2019., USN Most recently, the Navy has said it is looking to transform the Zumwalts into an “arsenal ship” of sorts outfitted primarily to conduct stand-off attacks against targets at sea and ashore. With just three ships that have seen their stealth capabilities steadily reduced the destroyers may be hard-pressed to provide even limited operational utility in these roles, even when heavily networked together with larger surface warfare task forces and other friendly units. We at The War Zone have long suggested it might be most practical to assign these ships to a special projects or development squadron, just as it did with the Seawolf -class submarines . The Seawolf saga is similar in many ways to that of the Zumwalts , to begin with, and all of those boats are now part of DEVRON 5. “I think what you’re going to see with DDG-1000 [ Zumwalt ] is, it’s going to be akin to the Seawolf program: we only built three of those and the submarine community, to their credit, rather than crying over spilt [sic] milk said, okay, we’re going to go learn from what we did on Seawolf and some of the technologies there, and we’re going to go build a better product going forward, which turned out to be the Virginia -class submarine,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Thomas Moore, head of Naval Sea Systems Command, said back in February 2017 , suggesting a development role could be in the destroyer’s future. “The combatant commanders are going to be glad to have it, and then we’re going to learn something about the new technologies we have on that and we’re going to roll that into the Future Surface Combatant going forward.” The third and final Zumwalt -class destroyer, the future USS Lyndon B. Johnson , in drydock in the final stages of construction in December 2018., USN The future Surface Development Squadron could easily provide a permanent home for the three Zumwalts , as well as other surface ships that are in many ways similarly orphaned. The first four Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) have become non-deployable training ships that might be better used as development platforms, as well. The LCS program, which consists of the distinct Freedom – and Independence -classes , has been a debacle and the Navy is crafting a final concept of operations for the still growing number of these ostensibly operational ships more than a decade after commissioning the first one. The service did not deploy a single one of these vessels on an operational cruise in 2018 for a variety of reasons . The Surface Development Squadron will very likely be a composite entity and could utilize ships detached for extended periods of time from their parent units. In 2017 , Navy officials suggested the new unit could include a mix of Zumwalts , LCS, and Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. USS Freedom , the lead ship in her sub-class and the very first of the Littoral Combat Ships., USN The latter ships are the service’s most numerous major surface combatants and are expected to see substantial upgrades in the coming years, even as more active development of the future Large Surface Combatant gets underway. It will be important to evaluate and experiment with the new capabilities, including hypervelocity ammunition , directed energy weapons , improved electronic warfare and intelligence gathering systems, have to offer. The Navy also expects the new development squadron to aid in helping to integrate unmanned vessels into its surface warfare operations. In 2018, the Office of Naval Research took ownership of an unmanned platform called the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV), or Sea Hunter, from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Navy is now in the process of getting a second one of these trimaran craft, called the Sea Hunter II , as part of its Medium Displacement Unmanned Surface Vessel (MDUSV) program. The service primarily sees Sea Hunter as a potential anti-submarine warfare platform, but it could also conduct a host of other missions in the future, which you can read about in more depth here . Placing these unmanned craft under the control of the Surface Development Squadron could help the Navy more actively explore their capabilities. The service had given DEVON 5 a similar task with regards to large unmanned undersea vehicles, until that program evolved to the point where it necessitated its own unit , Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One (UUVRON 1). In October 2018, the Navy also stood up its first dedicated unmanned aircraft development unit , Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Four (UX 24). Large Training Vehicle 38, one of the unique unmanned undersea vehicle assets now under the control of Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One., USN None of this is to say that the new Surface Development Squadron and its ships, possibly including the Zumwalts , may not have a limited operational mission or be available for specialized duties, as necessary, either. DEVRON 5 uses its three Seawolfs and other assets to conduct highly sensitive and secretive intelligence gathering and other missions, the vast majority of which remains classified , as did Submarine Development Squadron One Two ( DEVRON 12 ), until it became a regular submarine squadron in 2016. “They expertly accomplished a broad and challenging range of missions including: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, unmanned undersea vehicle employment, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface  warfare and extremely challenging shallow water, high-contact density scenarios,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Joseph Tofalo, then Commander, Submarine Forces, said at a change of command ceremony in 2016 . Having a dedicated surface development and test squadron will also help in crafting requirements for future warships. The Navy is already getting deeper into firming up what it wants from its future guided missile frigate, or FFG(X). Five companies are crafting design proposals for that ship, the first of which could get commissioned as early as 2025. The Navy already wants these ships to have a significant mix of surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, and air defense capabilities from the start, but it is already interested in ensuring that these ships have sufficient space and power resources to add in other capabilities in the future. These additions could include a smaller derivative of the latest AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare system the service is in the process of installing on its Arleigh Burkes , a 150 kilowatt solid-state laser directed energy weapon system , and full network connectivity under the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) concept. This latter feature will allow these ships to readily exchange information with other friendly forces at sea, in the air , and on land, and potentially control, or at least coordinate with, various unmanned surface vessels . An artist’s conception of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer knocking down an incoming missile with a solid-state laser. The Navy is interested in integrating a similar capability into its future frigates., Lockheed Martin Further down the line, the Navy is also beginning to flesh out its requirements for a future Large Surface Combatant that might replace some number of Arleigh Burkes , as well as the Ticonderoga -class cruisers. The work of a new developmental squadron would certainly help inform what the service actually needs out of its next major surface warship. In addition, this increased focus on traditional naval surface warfare is almost certainly driven in part by the U.S. military’s over-arching effort to re-prioritize preparedness for more conventional conflicts against potential “great power competitors,” such as Russia or China . As such, the Navy may also be interested in crafting an “aggressor” surface warfare element that could focus on mimicking the tactics, techniques, and procedures of possible opponents to help better evaluate the operating concepts that come out of units such as the Surface Development Squadron. The service is already looking to establish a similar aggressor unit for submariners to train against . At the same time, it may be hard for the Navy to dedicate any significant amount of ships or resources on a permanent and semi-permanent basis to this new developmental squadron. The service has had increasing trouble meeting the goal of having 355 active ships , as well as finding the sailors to crew them. Dedicating ships and crews to experimental duties may simply not be a realistic option, even if the developmental squadron has a secondary operational role. It is possible that Navy might be able to supplement any ships it does assign to the squadron with contractor-operated vessels serving as surrogates, something it has already done in other instances on a more ad hoc basis. For instance, earlier in January 2019, the service used a contracted ship to carry an LCS mission package to complete certain testing requirements . “We need this squadron to develop solutions to tough operational problems, accelerate new warfighting capabilities, and rapidly assist in the development and validation of tactics, techniques, and procedures,” Vice Admiral Brown declared at the Surface Navy Association conference. “It will be a place to take calculated risks and see what works and what doesn’t work.” With the Navy still working to determine the roles and missions of some of its newest ships and beginning to outline the requirements for its next generation of warships, now does seem like a prime time to create a dedicated experimental unit to further explore new and emerging demands for the service’s surface warfare fleets if it can balance these demands against its operational needs.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just three months after the Boeing-Saab consortium unveiled their candidate for the USAF’s T-X program , the clean-sheet design has taken to the skies for the first time. The sleek GE-F404 powered jet took to the skies over St. Louis on a 55 minute test flight with veteran test pilot Steve ‘Bull’ Schmidt at its controls. Boeing says the flight went as planned and “validated key aspects of the single-engine jet and demonstrated the performance of the low-risk design.” #NewBoeingTX has completed the first flight. Watch it here: pic.twitter.com/URIXmWoCmi — Saab (@Saab) December 20, 2016 This inaugural sortie came just days after it was discovered that Northrop Grumman had quietly been flying their Model 400 T-X contender over Mojave Spaceport. The type still has not been officially rolled out, appearing only in a few spotter images snapped late last summer. It also comes just days after Sierra Nevada Corporation and Turkish Aerospace Industries announced that they would be throwing their collective hat into the T-X ring by offering a fuel efficient and likely low-cost clean sheet design of their own. The aircraft will feature fly-by-wire controls and use two commercia l FJ44 turbofan engines often found on small business jets instead of a more powerful fighter jet engine. The rendering of the aircraft —supposedly already being built—looks like a lower performance, subsonic version of Boeing-Saab’s T-X design. Although we do not have the official T-X RFP from the USAF yet, it was thought that high-performance, maneuverability and expandability would be weighted heavily in the competition. This makes Sierra Nevada and TAI’s concept puzzling at first, but the consortium—which calls itself Freedom Aircraft Ventures—says they will still be able to accomplish the minimum G and AoA requirements by creating a lighter design. Not only that, but the aircraft will supposedly use about half the fuel for normal flights and cost significantly less, both in purchase price and sustainment costs. If the USAF decides to rationalize its T-X purchase against other pressing procurement requirements, Freedom Aircraft could be onto something. This is especially relevant as so much of future tactical pilot training will be dependent on what goes on within the brains of the aircraft , not on its raw performance. Additionally, future fighters are likely to be less maneuverable than today’s jets. The T-X competition seeks to replace hundreds of T-38C Talon trainers, most of which have been serving for about half a century. , USAF Investing heavily into hundreds of trainers slated to serve for many decades is probably a stupid move, as unmanned systems will (or at least should) increasingly erode tactical pilot training requirements in the decades to come. This is especially valid considering the unsustainable force structure that the USAF currently is planning toward, and the lack of pilots that the force is already dealing with . Once the T-X RFP is out it will take about a year to decide the winner of the contract. From there, development will begin in 2018, with low-rate production starting in 2022. Initial operating capability is slated for 2024. With five contenders now vying for a prize that could determine the future of tactical aircraft manufacturing in America, it is going to be one serious furball of a dogfight.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 5, 2018",Locomotive “4141” Painted Like Air Force One Will Carry George Bush To His Final Resting Place,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you are a regular reader, you are probably quite aware of our fascination and study of all things presidential travel and security . From the anatomy of the Presidential Motorcade and the unique vehicles that get added to it from time to time to updates to Air Force One and Marine One , we have covered it in-depth. But our feature on the special role trains have played when it comes to moving around those that have held the highest office in the land has to be one of my personal favorites. Now, a new chapter in that story is about to be written as a specially painted Union Pacific locomotive prepares to take the late President George H.W. Bush to his final resting place at his library in College Station, Texas as part of the intricate memorial service for the 41st President. The origin of locomotive 4141 dates back to 2005 when Union Pacific decided to dedicate a specially painted locomotive to George H.W. Bush. Its motif was designed to resemble Air Force One and emblazoned with ‘President Bush 41’ and ‘Presidential Library and Museum’ along its sides. Union Pacific Union Pacific described the project as such shortly after its official reveal: The unveiling ceremony is a fitting prelude to the grand opening of “ Trains: Tracks of the Iron Horse ,” on Nov. 7, 2005, at the Bush Library. The much-anticipated exhibit covers the rich technological, social and economic history of the railroad industry. “When we set out to design the Bush Library and Museum, I did not want it to be about just one person – rather, we wanted to touch a broader cross-section of American life, encompassing an eventful period of our history,” President Bush said. “The ‘ Tracks of the Iron Horse’ and the unveiling of UP 4141 is the latest example of our commitment to attracting the most unique, educational, and entertaining exhibits we can – and I am deeply grateful to Dick Davidson and Union Pacific for their friendship and support. If we had the UP 4141 back when I was still in Office, I might have left Air Force One behind more often!” UP 4141 marks only the sixth time that Union Pacific has painted a locomotive in colors other than the traditional UP “Armour Yellow” paint. The design team carefully studied photos of President Bush’s Air Force One, with the goal of recreating the scheme for UP 4141. Elements from Air Force One’s wings and tail, including an American flag, were placed on No. 4141’s rear panel, with the sweeping lines of forward motion representing progress. “The railroads have played a tremendous role in the growth of Texas and across our great country, and we’re thrilled that President Bush has chosen to showcase this wonderful history for the thousands of visitors to the Bush Library and Museum,” said Union Pacific Chairman and CEO Dick Davidson. “Union Pacific felt this was such a historic and important exhibit that creating UP 4141 was an appropriate way to recognize President Bush and his life-long service to our country.” George and Barbara Bush take in 4141 from its conductor cab., Union Pacific Bush was so enamored with the locomotive that he asked to take it for a spin, which Union Pacific agreed to. With a conductor by his side, the 41st President ran the train for a few miles with a massive smile on his face. Union Pacific The very special SD70ACe locomotive, which weighs 420,000 pounds when fully fueled and packs 4,300 horsepower, was largely pulled from active service after the economic crash of 2008, making a few sporadic cross-country trips before being touched-up and put back into storage once again at Union Pacific’s facility in Little Rock, Arkansas. Although its return to service is for a very solemn national event, one can’t think of a better chariot to triumphantly bring the President home to his final resting place alongside First Lady Barbara Bush and the couple’s daughter Robin that died from Leukemia at a very young age. 4141’s route will begin in Spring, Texas at 1pm and will travel 70 miles to College Station—a trip that will take roughly two and a half hours to complete, ending around 3:25pm. Along the way, it will pass through Hufsmith, Pinehurst, Todd Mission, Stoneham, Navasota, Millican, and Wellborn before reaching its final destination. You can bet that the tracks will be lined with patriotic folks looking to say a final goodbye to the President whose family has deep roots in Texas. Union Pacific Bush is the first deceased Commander In Chief to be transported to his burial via rail since Dwight D. Eisenhower’s made his way from Washington, D.C. to Abilene, Kansas nearly 50 years ago in 1969. But the use of Presidential trains for funeral processions goes way back. Most famously, Lincoln’s custom train changed the very idea of Presidential travel, regardless of if the President was alive or dead at the time he rode in it. From our feature on Presidential trains: During Lincoln’s time in office, a special executive coach dubbed United States was ordered to be built just for the President, although he supposedly detested the project. Lincoln was averse to luxury and what it signaled to his constituents during a time when the country was ravaged by internal warfare. The only time he rode in it was after his assassination, as the car was the centerpiece of the “Lincoln Special” funeral train that brought his body back to his hometown of Springfield, Illinois. It was a time of national mourning, and the train acted as a tangible nexus between the devastating headlines and the American people who were so affected by the loss. The car was not preserved after acting as Lincoln’s rail-bound hearse, and it was supposedly was lost in a fire years after its melancholy debut. The construction of this custom train car marked the first custom mechanized vehicle specifically built for the POTUS, which began a trend that has broadened remarkably in the last 150 years since. In some ways, it’s the great granddaddy of the Presidential limousine, Marine One, and Air Force One. But funerals aside, campaigning and traveling on trains for Presidential business dates back even further: The first Presidential candidate to use a train for campaigning was William Henry Harrison, who ran for President, unsuccessfully, in 1836. Then, in 1841, as President-elect, Harrison became the first to use a train to ride to his inauguration. Two decades later, President Lincoln set a new standard for the White House’s utilization of the rails. From the time he was voted into office, Lincoln put trains to use for the purpose of consolidating support for his policies and to reach Americans and Union soldiers directly. Lincoln even signed legislation that initiated the transcontinental railroad. Trains only grew in importance to Presidents and Presidential candidates in the decades that followed, and even as American rail travel waned in the latter half of the 20th Century, Presidential candidates still used trains to make a big impact via classical ‘whistlestop tours.’ This included President Bush who apparently loved the mode of campaigning. National Archives After its historic journey that will be watched by many millions of people, it’s probably safe to guess that 4141 will end up as a major fixture at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum. George H.W. Bush’s passing has been a time of reflection for many Americans. At a time when our politics is more polarizing than anyone alive can likely remember, this sad but also greatly inspirational national event has come as much needed relief from the hatred and the spin. But the public part of all this could not have the impact it has without all the unique and often symbolic vehicles involved in it. With all that in mind, tomorrows train voyage is certain to spur a rare sense of nostalgia and patriotic emotions for a country that could really use it.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 29, 2019","Raptor Nest: To Escape Hurricane Matthew, Dozens Of F-22s Migrate West From Langley AFB","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As Hurricane Matthew’s predicted path narrowed, it was clear that military aircraft and vessels based up and down the southeastern seaboard of the United States needed to run for their lives. Ships were sent to sea and aircraft began large scale migrations to safer territory. Langley AFB’s 1st Fighter Wing was no different, and the majority of their incredibly valuable fleet of 48 F-22 Raptors were quickly made ready for such a mission, dubbed Hurrevac (hurricane evacuation). Thirty-two of the wing’s jets flew to Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in Columbus, Ohio to find safe haven from Matthew’s brunt. Rickenbacker’s own KC-135R tankers provided support for the 1st Fighter Wing’s armada of Raptors. Although Columbus is only around 400 miles from Hampton, Virginia—well within the F-22’s range— support equipment and personnel had to accompany the stealth fighters to their temporary home. Hurrevac missions are historically not rare, but over the last decade hurricane activity has been minimal. This season, that appears to be changing. Just a month ago, the picture below went viral, showing 13 1st Fighter Wing F-22s stuffed inside the giant hangar at NASA’s Langley Research Center in preparation for Hurricane Hermine. F-22s huddle in NASA’s massive hangar at Langley AFB during Hurrican Hermine. , NASA Although dropping everything to evacuate for a hurricane is a major disruption for any military unit, doing so also serves as a good drill, sharpening airman’s skills on how to pack up and ship out on short notice. The F-22 community in particular, which represents the tip of the USAF’s spear, is tasked with rapidly responding to a whole slew of contingencies around the globe. Although the Rapid Raptor concept has been built around moving smaller numbers of Raptors around the globe at the drop of a hat, larger snap deployments are certainly possible—especially considering the rising tensions around the world. Just last February, a gaggle of F-22s showed up in Japan without notice in a massive show of force, and as the Raptor’s reputation continues to rise , the demand for its presence around the world will, as well. Not only that, but there are only about 125 F-22s that are combat-coded. Combine this with a mission-capable rate between 65 and 75 percent, and the number of Raptors actually ready for combat at any given time is fairly miniscule. So moving larger numbers of Raptors to a crisis zone quickly will be imperative when it comes to getting the most combat punch out of the relatively tiny fleet. F-22 sits on the ramp at Rickenbacker ANG base under temperate skies. , USAF Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 11, 2021",New Video Shows Night Stalker Little Bird Helicopters With Rare Modifications,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army Special Operations Command has posted a new video promoting its famed 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , better known as the Night Stalkers . The short montage of clips includes a backlit shot of four MH-6M Little Birds flying together as is extremely common for the type and the elite unit they fly with as well as a quick close up of a MH-6 approaching the camera. What’s different are the large bulges attached to their sides. This is where a plank used to externally airlift special operators is usually fitted or where weapons mounts are attached in the case of the AH-6M attack-configured Little Birds, but that’s not the case here. What we are seeing in the video seems to be an extremely uncommon sight on the 160th’s Little Birds. It is a novel external fuel tank design by Robertson Fuel Systems. They are officially called Improved Conformal Equipment, or ICE, and have come in progressively refined form. The tanks carry roughly 30 extra gallons of jet fuel, giving the helicopters about 160 miles of additional range—roughly a 62% increase over the regular MH-6 configuration—when two of the tanks are fitted. Robertson Fuel Systems The ICE tanks weigh 125 pounds and can be fitted in just 10 minutes in true 160th Little Bird fashion. These helicopters are meant to be transported in groups by any U.S. military airlifter and be unloaded and ready to fly within minutes, not hours, even at austere locations. Most importantly, the tanks retain the MH-6’s ability to carry three operators externally on the side they are mounted. So, the core mission of the MH-6 isn’t impacted by the tanks being fitted. Robertson Fuel Systems Little Birds are amazing flying machines and nobody, and I mean nobody, flies them like the 160th SOAR. Citizens in cities around the U.S. have gotten glimpses of just how insanely maneuverable these little helicopters are and how talented the pilots are at their controls. But what they aren’t known for is long range. These tanks offer a lot of flexibility without a huge penalty and some missions probably couldn’t be accomplished without them, at least not without risking additional forces in the form of setting up a forward arming and refueling point. Being able to eliminate this requirement for some missions is a huge advantage and just giving MH-6 crews more margin for the unknown during missions can be equally beneficial. Twitter Screencap After many decades of operations, and doing some very clandestine work in some really rough neighborhoods , the adaptability of the magnificent Little Bird continues to impress. Uncle Sam really gets his money worth with these aircraft and their brave pilots.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 4, 2019",You Have To Hear What Keeps The Head Of U.S. Strategic Command Up At Night,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Out of all the presentations and panels at this year’s Air Force Association convention, one speaker in particular had a most important, brave, and sobering message. A message that goes against the “company man” attitude we seem to find in many of the military’s top brass, and one that deals with something we here at The War Zone have been talking about for a long, long time. Instead of worrying about Kim Jong Un’s missiles or Putin’s huge nuclear arsenal, what keeps the head of Strategic Command, General John Hyten, up at night is the cold hard fact that America’s defense industrial complex has lost the ability to “go fast.” Hyten’s remarks on the topic begin at 25:48, if the player doesn’t take you there automatically when you push play: https://youtube.com/watch?v=3m691gCJWME In his powerful delivery of an eye opening messaging, the general states: “I’m very concerned that our nation has lost the ability to go fast. And we have adversaries now, and we see proof in those adversaries that they’re going faster than we are…  Slow, expensive, that’s the way it is…  I’m criticizing the entire process…the entire process is broken…We have to go faster, and we’re not, and it is frustrating the heck out of me. Look at the threat, if we’re not going faster than the threat than it’s wrong.” He goes on to highlight how the Minuteman I ICBM program met or exceeded all its expectations and objectives, delivering 800 three stage solid fuel rocket ICBMs, silos to put them in, and a very elaborate command and control architecture in just five years at a cost of $17B in today’s dollars—and none of it had been done before. Now, even with all we have learned over more than half a century, it takes 12 to 17 years and $84B to build half the missiles, refurbish the existing silos they will sit in, not build new ones, and the command and control architecture is a separate budget altogether. Hyten is on the right path here, and he has to be commended for making such a bold and inconvenient statement. But I think he goes too easily on the defense and aerospace industries. Some outfits have been known to do amazing things with small, agile teams that are less affected by bureaucratic red tape. But often times these units also have the advantage of operating in the classified world with a steady stream of cash that isn’t constantly under fire on Capitol Hill. We have talked about this same exact kind of issue many times before. Maybe a post that best encapsulates the technological and industry aspects of this issue is one I wrote called “Broken Booms: Why Is It So Hard To Develop A New USAF Tanker” that you can read here . In it I state, among other things, the following: “The 1950s saw the first jet tanker built by Boeing and fielded by the USAF. This aircraft was the KC-135 Stratotanker, and 60 years and some new engines later it remains the backbone of America’s tanker force. How on earth could we have gotten the tanker concept that right on the first try, way back then, in a time of drafting tables and slide rules, yet we have so much trouble fielding a suitable replacement 60 years later in an age of iPhones and computer aided drafting? Especially considering these replacements are based on airliners that have been flying for decades, the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330… …The truth is that the Manhattan Project took far less time than it has taken to procure just a partial replacement for the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet, and this new aircraft is hardly a clean-sheet design… What the hell is so hard about taking an existing wide-body airliner, with an existing track record of millions of hours in the sky, and turning it into a tanker? What am I missing here? The KC-135 took from 1954 to 1957, just three years, from the time the jet aerial refueling competition was launched to the time the aircraft became operational. When it comes to the KC-46, it took the DoD and Congress 10 years just to pick an airplane to buy under the stumbling, spastic and downright alarming KC-X procurement initiative… …Being the word’s preeminent aerial fighting force does not require every single platform to be completely cutting edge just for cutting edge’s sake. Instead, the Pentagon needs to pick and choose where to strategically spend their “cutting edge” dollars and where to spend their “need the hardware on the ramp yesterday ” dollars. Case in point: the KC-46 isn’t any existing aircraft at all, it deviates from the already painstakingly developed KC-767 that the Italians and Japanese use. An aircraft’s whose development is already paid for in full. Instead, the KC-46 combines the 767-200ER’s fuselage, with the 767-300F’s wing, gear, cargo door and floor, with the 767-400ER digital flightdeck and flaps. It then pairs this hodgepodge of components with uprated engines and a “sixth-generation” fly-by-wire remote controlled boom and adds various other US specific sub-systems. So now you have a plane whose components may have been in production for many decades, but has never actually flown in the KC-46A form… The realities of the crazy KC-X competition aside, the USAF probably would be better served with the already developed and proven KC-767 and thrown out all the gadgetry such as “remote booms” in order to get the hardware out there ASAP at the lowest possible cost and lowest possible developmental and operational risk. Sure, the KC-767 may have slightly less range, or it may use 1000 more feet of runway when totally grossed out on takeoff when compared to the KC-46 Pegasus “frankenplane,” but if we can get it cheaper and faster, and it will be more reliable, who really cares? Any slight capability lapses will only impact a tiny percentage of the theoretical missions the plane may actually be called to perform during service. Furthermore, when compared to the ancient KC-135 that the USAF already has in droves, the KC-767 is an upgrade of epic proportions, so why jeopardize a program with added development time, cost and risk for relatively minor performance improvements? …As far as development goes, to a large degree, the aerospace industry in America has lost its way. It is sad but true. Sometimes a boom can be just a boom. Not everything has to be Star Wars and Steve Jobs. Just because you can apply new technology to something does not mean it is beneficial or cost effective. But considering the “show it on Power Point and they will buy it” proven business model that exists, with the Pentagon being the suckers they are, how can you really blame industry for piling on the expensive tech, even if it is not needed? Still, big aerospace defense contractors need to look back in history and find out how incredibly complex problems (at the time) were solved so efficiently and without the incredible technological benefits we enjoy today. Maybe there is a systemic issue in our engineering educational process or within the the workflow itself that has hampered our ability to create fast and cost effective solutions to relatively straight-forward problems.” Sadly, the article still rings true today. The KC-46 is further delayed for various reasons, one of which includes problems with the boom chronically scraping the skin of the aircraft it refuels—fine if you are flying an A-10, not fine if you are flying a radar absorbent material coated B-2, F-22, or F-35. KC-46A during testing., USAF One way the USAF can break the habit of long development cycles—at least in the tactical aircraft domain—as well as solve a whole list of other issues including pilot shortages and operational budget shortfalls, is by moving toward an increasingly unmanned fleet. I detail all this is my piece “The Alarming Case of the USAF’s Mysteriously Missing Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles” that you can read here . There are some signs that the Pentagon is slowly coming to terms with unsustainable procurement practices. For instance, more investments in the development and fielding of so called “rapid capabilities” are being made , along with investments into research programs that aim to unlock the possibilities of today’s latest technologies and manufacturing techniques to build weapons cheaper and faster than using traditional processes. Budget austerity (relatively speaking) has also slowly begun changing the Pentagon’s affinity toward buying “and the kitchen sink” weapon systems that are loaded with features beyond their basic requirements list to more streamlined systems that can be upgraded later down the road. Additionally, programs like the B-21 Raider are being tailored to avoid requirements creep, spiraling costs, and massive developmental timetables. But it will take more officers in leadership positions to come to terms with the reality that Hyten describes so well and to demand change and enact policies that will help realize those changes. If the Pentagon cannot make systemic changes in the way it develops new weapons and capabilities, or even simply replaces old hardware with conservatively updated new hardware, parity will become further within our competitors reach, and in some key areas we will fall behind our potential enemies. This invites major risk on both a military and geopolitical level. Hyten greets SecDef Mattis at STRATCOM headquarters in Nebraska. , USAF Also worth noting in the General Hyten’s address was his clear response to a question regarding the threat posed by an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). The EMP threat is a murky one to say the least. Some see it as an overhyped boogeyman whose danger has been perpetuated by the survivalist, doomsday prepper, and to some degree, the science fiction communities. Others see it as an incredibly deadly asymmetric weapon, one that would be ideal for a rogue state like North Korea to use against the U.S. and its allies. Recently Pyongyang threatened exactly that , which does add some validity to the threat itself, not to mention they now have the delivery systems to make the possibility of using such a tactic a reality. The truth is that Americans are far more likely to suffer similar effects from a series of cyber attacks than from a high-altitude EMP (HEMP), but still, Hyten makes it clear that it is a grave threat—one that Strategic Command is prepared to survive, but the rest of country clearly isn’t (fast forward to 41:30 if the video doesn’t take you there directly): https://youtube.com/watch?v=3m691gCJWME Among other things, the general states: “An EMP pulse is a very dangerous threat, and it’s a realistic threat. If you are not nuclear hardened it will basically shut down any operational computer in the range of the EMP… I was asked if STRATCOM was prepared to respond to an EMP attack, and the answer is yes because we have nuclear hardened satellites, nuclear hardened command and control shelters, we can respond to that etc. But our nation as a whole really has not looked at EMP, we have not looked at the critical infrastructure that could be damaged by EMP, and we need to kind of take a step back and look at that entire threat because it is a realistic threat.” That is a sober assessment from the man who knows nuclear systems and their implementation probably better than anyone in the United States. The video has a ton of other great tidbits of information, like how Hyten wants to move ground based sensor systems that America’s rickety missile defense system relies on to a space-based system, and some interesting insight into work-life balance for a man who has his own SCIF in his basement.

We also learned of the Zumwalt class destroyer fleet’s new experimental organizational structure . There were also some fresh indications that the B-21 Raider is indeed set to arrive at Edwards AFB fairly soon. A USMC Harrier crashed, as well . It was the fourth total loss of a U.S. military aircraft in May alone. And there was much more .Â Regardless, there was a ton of stuff we just couldn’t get to, but it’s not too late! Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to. In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk about about this little cameo appearance of chaff off the SoCal coast right in the military’s giant missile range complex. And yes, we did the math, the heart of the jetstream was right over that location where the chaff was released and it was hauling at just the right speed to grab the material and move it out of view in less than an hour: Ok, yes I know that TX and OK are dealing with a lot of severe weather.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 18, 2019",Check Out These Detailed Images Taken Aboard the Navy’s New Stealth Destroyer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is on its delivery voyage from General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, to Baltimore, where it will be commissioned into the Navy’s inventory on October 15th. After that, the Zumwalt will make the long voyage to its new homeport in San Diego. Along the way, Zumwalt made a port call—her first ever—in Newport, Rhode Island, where some lucky folks got a tour. Photos of Zumwalt’s interior have been in limited supply, but now with the ship about to make major news, the Navy seems willing to loosen these restrictions. Check out these photos via the AP below: Shot taken from the bow of the Zumwalt showing the low-observable (stealthy) housing of one of the ship’s 155mm AGS, as well as the some of the 80 individual vertical launch cells that line the ship’s gunnels. , AP A rare shot of the bridge of the Zumwalt including the array of big-screen monitors that repeat seamless video imagery from cameras distributed around the perimeter of the ship. , AP The passageways inside the Zumwalt are suprisingly spacious., AP A shot from inside Zumwalt’s 7,500 square foot hangar bay., AP Zumwalt’s stealthy composite deckhouse with various apertures for sensors and mechanical systems. The bridge is located behind the windows running across the structure. , AP Another one of Zumwalt’s inner passages. , AP It may be harder to detect and attack on the high-seas, but in port Zumwalt requires the same old-school force protection as its less stealthy counterparts., AP The Zumwalt sits at rest in Newport, RI, during its first port of call. This shot gives a good view of all the sensors and openings laid into its composite deckhouse., AP What was not pictured was Zumwalt’s cutting-edge Mission Center , which supposedly looks like something on a sci-fi starship. Also not shown are the Zumwalt’s twin 155-mm Advanced Gun Systems that are housed on the bow of the ship’s tumblehome hull . For a destroyer, the Zumwalt is very large. 610 feet long, 80.7 feet wide and displaces a whopping 15,000 tons. As a comparison, an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, the mainstay surface combatant of the US Navy, is roughly 100 feet shorter, 15 feet narrower and has a smaller displacement by about 6,000 tons. This is one big-ass destroyer. A great shot of Zumwalt showing the ship’s stealthy openings along her hull that allow her to operate safely as any ship while in dense waterways and while docking. When on combat patrols the ship would “clean-up” to present a minimal radar return. r , AP Once Zumwalt settles in at Naval Station San Diego, Captain James Kirk (no kidding) and his crew of about 150, roughly half that of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, will run the highly automated ship and its brand new combat system through its paces during a long regime of exercises. If this post-delivery maintenance availability period goes as planned it will culminate with the Zumwalt being certified as operational in 2018.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2019","U.S. Military Is Sending Fighter Jets, Recon Aircraft, Engineers, and More To The Middle East (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon has announced it will deploy approximately 1,500 personnel to the Middle East, including fighter jets, reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, a battalion of Patriot surface-to-air missile systems, and combat engineers. However, U.S. military officials have already clarified that some 600 of these personnel are already in the region and will simply be extending their tours. The deployments are in response to still largely nebulous claims from the U.S. government that intelligence showed Iran and its proxies were preparing to launch attacks on American interests in the Middle East. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan revealed basic details about the new force posture on May 24, 2019, though he did not say specifically where the additional personnel would be arriving. The day before, he had dismissed various news reports that had said the United States was considering sending between 5,000 and 10,000 additional troops to the region. It should be noted that tthe U.S. military already has tens of thousands of troops in the Middle East. Since National Security Advisor John Bolton first announced the Iranian threat on May 6, 2019, the U.S. military has sent B-52H bombers, F-15C Eagle fighter jets, and an additional battery of Patriots to the region, as well as expedited the deployment of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her associated carrier strike group to the area. The U.S. Navy also sent the amphibious ship USS Arlington to swap places with another already sailing in and around the Persian Gulf. “I approved the [U.S. Central Command] combatant commander’s request for the deployment of additional resources and capabilities to the Middle East to improve our force protection and safeguard U.S. forces given the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, including the IRGC [Islamic Revolution Guard Corps] and its proxies,” Shanahan said in a statement. “The additional deployment to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility is a prudent defensive measure and intended to reduce the possibility of future hostilities.” But, as noted, the extension of the existing deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air defense system battalion to the region reflects 40 percent of this total “deployment.” It is not clear whether or not any of the other actual additive deployments were previously scheduled and could coincide with the withdrawal of other personnel, as turned out to be the case with the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and the USS Arlington . Shanahan did not elaborate on what types of fighter jets or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft the United States would be sending, either. The U.S. military routinely rotates these types of aircraft, including unmanned ISR platforms, through the region. Earlier this year, for instance, the U.S. Air Force withdrew its F-22 Raptors from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), bringing regular deployments of those stealth jets to the Middle East to an end for the first time in years. The service has since deployed F-15Cs and F-35A Joint Strike Fighters to the region in their place. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2_6IYT3wW-g The U.S. government’s descriptions of the exact nature of the threats from Iran to U.S. interests in the region, or those of its allies, continue to be vague and there can only be growing questions about how imminent those risks might actually be as time goes on. A lone rocket did land inside Baghdad’s Green Zone near the U.S. Embassy compound on May 19, 2019 , and Iraqi authorities indicated one of the country’s Iranian back Shi’ite militias might have been responsible. However, no group has claimed to be have been behind that attack, which caused minimal damage and no casualties. In addition, the United States and others have blamed Iran or its proxies, possibly Yemen’s Houthi rebels, for launching sabotage attacks on four oil tankers, including the Norwegian-flagged M/V Andrea Victory , off the coast of the UAE on May 13, 2019 . The evidence behind these conclusions remains limited and the Yemeni group has not taken responsibility for that attack, though they have publicly stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia in the past week using ballistic missiles and drones . The timing of the Pentagon’s new deployment announcement itself is curious, given that Shanahan himself seemed to downplay the immediacy of any potential threats just days ago . “I think our steps were very prudent and we’ve put on hold the potential for attacks on Americans and that’s what’s extremely important,” he told reporters after a closed-door meeting on the issue with lawmakers on May 21, 2019 . “I’d say we’re in a period where the threat remains high and our job is to make sure that there is no miscalculation by the Iranians,” he continued, without offering any new information about the reported threats. “I just hope Iran is listening. We’re in the region to address many things, but it’s not to go to war with Iran.” For their part, the Iranians also insist they are not looking for a war with the United States, but will also defend themselves if necessary, raising concerns about the potential risk that either side could misinterpret additional military moves into or within the region as potential threats. It remains to be seen how the regime in Tehran will respond to the new American force posture. On May 24, 2019, two Democrat Senators, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the former of whom is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that Trump Administration was also now looking to use the supposed threats from Iran to invoke an emergency clause in the Arms Export Control Act to expedite arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other countries without Congressional approval. A number of deals to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been on hold in the Senate over concerns about how the countries are prosecuting their controversial conflict against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as over Saudi Arabia’s brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. There were also reports that the Trump Administration could seek to use this same authority to speed up arms sales to Jordan and Thailand, as well, but it is unclear what the exact justification for using the emergency provisions of the AECA would actually be and whether these latter two cases would have any relations to the current situation regarding Iran. We will update this story if and when new information becomes available. UPDATE: 3:30pm EST— The Wall Street Journal has now reported that amid the Pentagon’s announcement and the Trump Administration’s desire to expedite arms sales to Saudi Arabia and others, that the U.S. government is also engaged in back-channel communications with Iranian contacts about potential diplomatic options to defuse the latest tensions. The United States and Iran do not have formal diplomatic relations. UPDATE: 3:55pm EST— Military.com has reported , citing an unnamed U.S. government official, that the reason why details about the announced deployment are so limited is that it is still in the planning stages, despite the Pentagon’s announcement. That same individual said the bulk of the personnel would come from the U.S. Army, but it is unclear whether or not they were referring to the inclusion of 600 soldiers who are already in the region in the original total force package. UPDATE: 4:05pm EST— There is now a publicly available copy of the Trump Administration’s justification for citing the emergency provisions in the AECA to expedite arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Jordan, though there is no mention of Thailand as previously reported. As expected, it cites Iranian threats and their support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen. It also cites the recent “threat reporting” about supposed potential attacks against American forces in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 18, 2019",The Dark World Of USAF Special Ops Air Refuelers And Their Modified KC-135RT Tankers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A long-upheld Air Force axiom states that ‘nobody kicks ass without tanker gas’ (NKAWTG). That includes special operations aviators flying secretive, sometimes covert or clandestine missions at low altitude, under the darkness of night, deep into contested airspace. But refueling these aircraft under such circumstances isn’t the job of any tanker squadron, it falls on a select group of KC-135 tanker pilots, boom operators, and navigators that have quietly supplied this unique capability to the Air Force special operations community for decades. Now, these elite aviators and airman have been allowed to come forward to talk exclusively to The War Zone about their highly unique mission and the special tactics and equipment they wield in order to execute it successfully. When you think of a KC-135 Stratotanker, low-level operations in total darkness and radio silence doesn’t come to mind. But for a cadre of 22nd Air Refueling Wing personnel based at McConnell AFB, this is an operational reality that they train tirelessly for. The low altitude aspect of the mission is tactically relevant for a number of reasons. First of which is the fact that heavy, slow, and low-flying turboprop special operations aircraft don’t have to struggle to climb up to the KC-135R’s normal speed and operating altitudes just to get gas. But the tactic also limits the reach of enemy sensors and especially those on the surface of the earth that are limited by their line of sight in relation to the horizon. At a distance, even aircraft flying in the single thousands of feet can remain undetected during the critical refueling operations. Working with McConnell Air Force base’s 22nd Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs, The War Zone was able to interview a group of special operations air refueling (SOAR) crewmen so that they could give their unique view of this shadowy mission set. Major Bradlee Seehawer, the Deputy Chief of Special Operations Air Refueling with the 22nd Operations Group, describes the SOAR mission as such: “The special operations mission is really defined by the modifications for the KC-135 and how we use it to support our special operations forces. At its core, it’s the same air refueling mission that we do for any other receiver any time of day, but because they [the aircraft] have additional mission requirements, we have some additional capabilities. I like breaking it down into three primary distinctions. The special operations tankers, they have additional communications capabilities on the aircraft. We can do refueling in low light situations through our use of night vision goggles. We are also the only KC-135 mission that still requires the use of a navigator. All the KC-135 navigators are here in McConnell. … It really comes down to our training and the flexibility that we can provide. We train above and beyond the typical KC-135 crew to be able to perform this mission and to ensure a flawless performance during the dynamic special operations missions that can require us to plan and replan in quicker intervals than you normally expect in a normal KC-135 mission. … Due to receiver requirements, it can happen at night and in situations where we don’t want to be heard or seen. That goes back to, again, one of those core capabilities of low light and low emissions air refueling. We do refueling with NVGs, night vision goggles. That’s unique to us. We can do it quietly with reduced radio chatter so that we’re not producing or emitting as much noise.” A McConnell SOAR boom operator prepares to refuel a C-130 under darkness with the help of night vision goggles. , U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Alan Ricker All KC-135 crews are trained in emissions control (EMCON) operating procedures, but the special operations tanker crews train as if it is part of everyday operations. They are far more experienced with dealing with the challenges surrounding executing tanking operations without the use of traditional radio communications, not to mention doing it while blacked out, and at low altitudes. The airframe primarily used for the most challenging of SOAR missions is not the standard KC-135R, but is the rare KC-135RT variant. Fewer of this type exist than the number of fingers on your hands, based on our research. McConnell ground crews prepare a KC-135 for a nighttime sortie., U.S. Air Force photo/Airman 1st Class Victor J. Caputo The jet is specially modified in a number of ways. These enhancements include a refueling receptacle above the cockpit so that the KC-135RTs themselves can be refueled by other tankers—a feature standard Stratotankers do not have. Major Jonathan Rey, the Chief of Special Operations Air Refueling for the 22nd Operations Group, describes this capability in more detail: “They are able to accept gas from other tanker aircraft whether that be a KC-135 or a KC-10. It gives them more flexibility to actually refuel their receivers. A KC-135RT is about to take gas from another KC-135. The ‘RTs’ are distinguishable by their aerial refueling receptacle above the cockpit and by an array of antennas strewn around their fuselages., U.S. Air Force photo/ 2nd Lt. Christopher Buzzetta Major Seehawer adds that missions can include tankers working together, not just to refuel special operations aircraft, but also to replenish their own KC-135RTs. Often this includes working with other ‘RTs’ as a team to accomplish a complex mission: “We have that capability [taking gas from other tankers]. Not necessarily that we employ it very often, but we can do that, absolutely. With this being a unique asset to McConnell, it’s something that we tend to do mostly internally. Of course, we’re always willing to take someone else’s gas. If someone wants to come and give us some plugs , we’re open to it.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=mT-T-LY3XFY Being able to consolidate gas from other tankers provides greater flexibility to a larger combined tanker force during complex operations. This is especially true if a mission runs long due to bad weather, or any of many possible contingencies, and aircraft run low on gas. SOAR crews can get low and closer to thirsty receivers without taking on too much risk. For special operations aircraft, they can do all this with minimal communications and without lighting up. This capability is often ‘stacked’ with other special operations tankers, like the MC-130, whereby the KC-135 SOAR crews pass gas to the MC-130 so that it can refuel low-flying helicopters and Ospreys as they push in and out of their target areas. The KC-135RTs can be topped off by other KC-135s and KC-10s to keep the special operations MC-130 laden with fuel to pass to its thirsty, low and slow flying receivers. A unique communications suite is another major asset that the RC-135RT brings to the table and it’s clearly more elaborate than the one on standard KC-135Rs. Beyond satellite connectivity and data-links, it’s not exactly known what the ‘RT’s’ configuration entails, but KC-135s can be equipped with roll-on communications gateways —like the Roll-On Beyond line-of-sight Enhancement, or ROBE —that can be massive force multipliers for themselves and everyone around them. Although we don’t know for sure if this is part of KC-135RT’s communications arsenal, clearly the one it has is quite capable. Seehawer continues to elaborate on the KC-135RT’s unique features: “All the SOAR aircraft, they have modifications as far as the communications piece to it. That’s standard through the SOAR KC-135 fleet. … We use them to maintain direct contact with our receivers and our liaison officers. That allows us to get updated refueling information to dynamically replan our missions in the air to best suit the fast-paced special operations missions that we support.” Major Seehawer also noted that it doesn’t necessarily require a KC-135RT to execute the SOAR mission set, as it depends on the mission requirements: “It’s something worth noting that all of the receiver-capable KC-135s that we have at McConnell fall under the umbrella of special operations support, but they are not an inherent capability that we use to define the special operations air refueling asset. It’s something that we have and that we provide to our users. Again, we train constantly to make sure that we’re proficient in it, but it’s not something that’s inherently defining special operations air refueling.” As to who exactly is designated as a SOAR ‘customer,’ that is a little more opaque based on our interview. Clearly, AC-130 gunships and MC-130 special operations transport variants of the venerable Hercules airlifter are known benefactors of the KC-135 community’s SOAR capabilities, and the C-17 also has a special operation support role. But beyond that, the matter becomes sensitive in nature. A KC-135RT refuels an AC-130 gunship at low altitude. In this case, the lights are on, but the operation can be done by SOAR tanker crews in total darkness., U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Alan Ricker The 22nd Air Refueling Wing doesn’t ‘own’ the assets they service and cannot speak for the units that do. Major Rey did mention that they usually embed one of their own onboard a receiver aircraft during SOAR missions: “We usually operate with one of our personnel embedded with our users. They facilitate that liaison and coordinate all that stuff. They’re the ones that actually manage that aspect of it, a constantly changing mission set and all the rest of the players that are in the fight.” When it comes to the low-altitude aspect of their mission, it was made clear that they couldn’t disclose just how low they get, but it was also made clear that other KC-135s and qualified crews can do lower-level refueling as well. But once again, the fact that they can do it under special circumstances, and have a unique capacity to navigate to their refueling points, and make quick changes to their mission plan on the fly to ensure mission success makes them different. U.S. Air Force photo/Airman 1st Class Ryan Zeski Major Seehawer explains how the challenges their missions often include differentiates them from the rest of the KC-135 force: “I think it’s that communications aspect. Potentially there’s a lot going on, although additional comms capabilities and the navigator is sitting there monitoring it to make sure that the crew is operating in a safe manner and we know where we’re supposed to go. There is a lot more information and flexibility that’s required of us that we have to use to support our users in real-time. I think that’s a significant challenge. Major Rey adds: “I’d also say Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) use, that’s not standard use throughout the KC-135 fleet. We’re the only ones that actually use the NVGs. The pilot’s using NVGs is out of the mode of what the normal KC-135 pilot would do. Having an extra person in the cockpit like a navigator is imperative for us to be able to do the mission. … From a pilot seat, you have to be able to see the receiver. Even the best NVGs out there, you’re not going to be able to see your receiver aircraft all that well. It takes a little bit of practice to be able to acquire and be able to be able to get on track and get in front of the receiver.” A night vision photo taken in 1991 of a KC-135 crew during Desert Storm. Navigators have all but disappeared from the KC-135 fleet, and their stations have been stripped of much of their original equipment. But the KC-135RT still have a navigator onboard., DoD via National Archives Major Seehawer paints a larger picture of how all this plays together during an actual mission: “Keeping in mind that it’s low emissions and low visibility, so it’s going to be dark out. We’re not necessarily going to be able to see a receiver very easily. These NVGs will help us spot them with the light that’s available. That combined with precision timing, and again, navigation gets us to where we need to be to conduct that refueling. … As far as painting a picture of the situations where it’s dark, it’s night, we can’t see the receiver, but as far as the actual environments that we’re in, we operate in a variety of unique and constantly changing environments. It’s hard to pin it down to any one specific area. Like I said, we’re bound by the same regulations as any other KC-135, so we’re not dipping and diving. We’re not doing anything unsafe. We just use all that additional training to accomplish the refuelings in the expeditious and competent manner that only McConnell can do.” SOAR ‘customers’ often fly missions at low altitudes at night, like this MC-130J Commando II flying over the North Sea., U.S. Air Force photo by 1st Lt Chris Sullivan/Released Training crews to do this is not a simple task. They need to be ready to operate virtually anywhere in the world and under classified circumstances, executing highly complex and dynamic missions on short notice. Major Seehawer states: “Training-wise, again, the specialized use of the reduced communications and our low light capabilities require some additional training. The crews are trained extensively on how to use the NVGs and the comm equipment that we have. We also practice… We train extensively both at home station and abroad to make sure that we are proficient in all aspects of the mission.” As if refueling another aircraft under normal conditions isn’t hard enough , SOAR boom operators also have to master low-altitude refueling. This can drastically change the way the boom reacts. Michael Sage, the KC-135 Special Operations Mission Manager at McConnell, has experience in the boomer’s pod and describes this issue as such: “The air refueling boom is at a slower speed. It’s a lot harder to control, so it’s more challenging for the boom operator to make the contacts with the receiver. It’s just less airflow over the control surfaces for the boom, so it doesn’t react quite as quickly.” Youtube Screencap Major Rey also gives his perspective on how special training is the backbone of the KC-135’s SOAR capability and how individuals are selected to join the elite and small community: “From a pilot’s perspective, learning to fly with the navigator is a lot different for a lot of the guys and it is a big deal at McConnell because there aren’t very many navigators and this is the only base for it and for this mission specifically. Learning to fly and the delegation of roles and everything else is a big piece of it. … Just like all the reqs (requirements) of the special certifications and everything else that happens, that is a squadron commander’s directive. Squadron commanders choose the individuals to actually go into the specific programs. That applies to SOAR and to the ‘RT’ receiver capable tankers. Squadron commanders actually delegate all of that.” As for the size of KC-135 SOAR community, it definitely isn’t large, but actual numbers are classified. Major Seehawer elaborates: “Nothing specific we can give as far as numbers, however, we have told you that the 22nd Air Refueling Wing is the only place where you’re going to find Special Operations Air Refueling. Actually, as a result, I’m proud of us being the only KC-135 community to support all nine combatant commands with our support of special operations. No specific numbers, but we do have approximately 3,800 people on base. It’s somewhere between zero and 3,800.” KC-135RTs sit peacefully on the ramp at McConnell AFB., U.S. Air Force photos/Airman 1st Class Christopher Thornbury With anti-access/area-denial tactics being put into play by America’s most capable peer state competitors, being able to enhance survivability by refueling aircraft at lower altitudes, in essence keeping them outside the detection horizon of threat radars, seems like it could become a far more widespread tactic than in the past. And clearly, USAF decision makers are very concerned with the vulnerability of the tanker fleet. With this in mind, I asked if this capability could become more widespread in the future. Here’s what Major Seehawer said: “While that would certainly be in the realm of the feasibility, it’s probably in the realm of the possible with the upcoming KC-46, which in and of itself is going to provide greater situational awareness for those connections with other aircraft and also avoiding contact and threats through their additional capability. There’s something else coming that should be better suited for that than what we provide at the current point.” KC-46 undergoing electromagnetic emissions tests in the large anechoic chamber at Edwards AFB. The new tanker has an advanced communications system that may even eclipse that of the KC-135RT. In addition, it has survivability upgrades as well, such as missile approach warning and countermeasures system. Other enhanced situational awareness capabilities will allow crews to better understand the threats in their operating area., USAF The KC-46 Pegusus’ imminent arrival into the USAF’s inventory looms large over the KC-135 community in general, but this is especially so for McConnell AFB which was designated as one of the first bases to receive the jet years ago. $267M has been spent just on infrastructure improvements at the base to accommodate the new aircraft. But could the far more advanced KC-46A take on the SOAR role? Lieutenant Daniel de La Fe, Acting Chief of Public Affairs with the 22nd Air Refueling Wing, responded to the query: “We can’t really speculate too much about the KC-46 now with all of this in the news. I know that once it gets here, there will be a crew workload study that’s going to be performed during the IOT—the initial operational test and eval—to determine what missions it can and can’t support. … The KC-135 is going to continue this SOAR mission well into the future. As with our specialized operators here, it’ll ease that transition of the KC-46 coming in to fill that role somewhere down the line.” Major Rey added: “We’ve been told by the KC-46 personnel that that aircraft is going to be taking this mission set on. As soon as it lands here they want to try to start testing it making sure that she’ll be able to fill all the requirements that the KC-135 currently can do.” KC-46 refeulls another KC-46 during testing. Like the KC-135RT, the KC-46 has a refueling receptacle., Boeing The KC-46 could provide a big boost to the SOAR mission if it can execute it under actual operational conditions. As we have seen with the second generation 767 tanker derivative, nothing seems simple and the program has been plagued with setbacks . Major Seehawer does see the jet’s larger fuel carrying capability as a potential boon for the SOAR mission: “We’re talking about the capabilities of the KC-46, but especially in terms of being able to be refueled, I would also talk about our KC-135s and the ones that can be refueled [KC-135RTs]. It’s not necessarily allowing us also more fuel [for offload]. That is a possibility, but we can also just use it to stay aloft for longer periods of time. There are a couple different ways you can employ that additional fuel whether it’s in a KC-46 or a KC-135. Ultimately, you’re right. The KC-46 will provide a new approach to providing strategic air power for sure.” The cockpit of one of the 22nd Air Refueling Wing’s KC-135 during a SOAR mission. The center stack of ‘steam gauges’ are being replaced by large screen displays on KC-135Rs, although it’s not clear if the SOAR optimized KC-135RT models will get a similar enhancement., U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Alan Ricker The KC-135R fleet is going through a major upgrade , one that brings more automation, better situational awareness, and improved crew resource management to the 60-year-old aircraft’s cockpit. Known as the ‘Block 45’ configuration, it would seem that this update would be a particularly useful enhancement for the small KC-135RT force. Although our interviewees couldn’t comment on that possibility specifically, changes are coming to the KC-135RT fleet. Major Seehawer breaks down the situation for us: “We talked about that navigator a little bit. Navigators have been on their way out of the KC-135 community since the early 2000s. With KC-46 coming around, we’re just at the end of the line for that crew position. We’re transitioning and preparing for the next generation of special operations air refueling through our additional pilot program. Instead of a navigator, you’re going to have an additional pilot that will sit in that navigator seat and provide the situational awareness and communications management that the navigator used to provide. That is a new paradigm for us that we’re currently working through.” A KC-135RT approaches the boom of another KC-135. , 22nd Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs As for the question of where and when has this capability has been employed operationally, the McConnell SOAR crew could not answer that question due to security restrictions. But the point was made abundantly clear that it happens everywhere it’s needed and it definitely has been needed. But really, they don’t have to make a case for this mission’s utility. The USAF hasn’t kept a small fleet of specialized tankers and aircrews around through multiple budget massacres over the decades or vanity’s sake. This is a critical, high-demand, low-density capability that is likely more relevant now than it ever has been. McConnell AFB takes great pride in their full-aspect air refueling mission, including their seldom discussed SOAR capabilities. Major Seehawer sums up this reality perfectly: “McConnell’s motto is ‘we are AR.’ We define air refueling in all aspects. We’re the only one that does that. I’m very proud that I could’ve been at this base for as long as I have been.” An impressive line of McConnell-based KC-135s execute the ‘elephant walk’ during a readiness drill., McConnell AFB/USAF Author’s note: A huge thanks to Lt. Daniel de La Fe of the 22nd Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs shop for working for months with us on this article.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",You Can Buy This Rare British Army Mine Resistant Armored Truck For The Zombie Apocalypse,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A relatively rare 4×4 Tempest mine-protected armored truck, one of only eight 4×4 Tempests to ever have served with the British Army, has come up for auction online. So, if you’re worried about increased hazards along your own commute, are looking to stand out in your neighborhood, or are looking for a new ride that can carry you safely through hordes of zombies or past wasteland bandits, you can make a bid on it yourself. British auction house Brightwells is handling the sale of the Tempest , which by all account is in running condition with a working 300 brake horsepower Cat engine. The listing, which the U.K. defense analysis site Think Defence was among the first to spot, does not make any mention of what, if any, additional ex-military equipment might still be in the vehicle. At the time of writing, the top bid for the vehicle was 2,000 pounds, or around $2,560, but it seems highly unlikely that this meets the minimum reserve price for the vehicle, which originally cost the U.K. government closer to $500,000. You’ll need to secure an export license if you want to get it out of the United Kingdom, too. Of course, private purchases of military vehicles, including armored vehicles and even tanks , are hardly unheard of and mine-resistant armored trucks, now commonly referred to as MRAPs after the U.S. military’s particular program , have become a ubiquitous part of conflicts around the world. But having a Tempest would be owning an interesting piece of mine-resistant vehicle history. The very origins of the basic design, and how it came to the attention of the United Kingdom, are somewhat convoluted, but the vehicle served as the basis for a very popular subsequent MRAP known as the Cougar. State-owned South African manufacturing conglomerate Denel , through its subsidiary Denel-Mechem , had developed the 4×4 vehicle first under the name Lion in the 1990s. Decades before, South African firms had already established themselves as world leaders in mine-resistant vehicle design , the vast majority of which used V-shaped underbodies to try to deflect mine blasts and other explosions as safely as possible away from the occupants. The Tempest presently up for sale through Brightwells., Brightwells Per a now defunct British Army Royal Engineers webpage, an archived copy of which you can fine here , the 12-ton Lion combined a new armored body with cab and chassis components from the Peterbilt 330 tractor together with a Marmon-Herrington four-wheel-drive conversion. However, other sources suggest that the primary donor vehicle was a tractor from Mack South Africa , according to Think Defence . Eventually, the rights to the Lion passed to an American-headquartered company, Technical Solutions Group (TSG), which continued to work on the design, eventually dubbing it the Cougar. TSG, in turn, worked with yet another firm, Seafire, to market these and other vehicles in Europe. The rear of the Tempest., Brightwells Separately, beginning in the late 1990s, the Royal Engineers had begun looking for replacements for a small number of vehicles derived from the South African Mamba , which they had acquired for use during peacekeeping missions in the Balkans earlier in the decade. As if things were complicated enough, British firm Supacat , better known for their all-terrain vehicles, worked with Seafire to pitch TSG’s design to the British Army. The name Tempest was chosen to help differentiate the armored trucks from other British military systems named Cougar at the time. Between 2001 and 2002, the British Army ultimately acquired just eight of these vehicles at a total cost of more than $3.8 million at the time. Supacat became responsible for making further modifications to the vehicles, including the installation of additional underbody armor and U.K.-specific radios. A promotional shot of a Tempest, with the vehicle’s name prominently on the hood., British Army But instead of going to the Balkans to replace the Mambas, the Tempests had arrived just in time for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The United Kingdom was a major party to that operation. As the invasion quickly turned into an occupation and the threat of insurgent attacks and improvised explosive devices grew, the Tempests, in sand-colored paint schemes, head to Iraq for patrol duties. By 2004, some of the Tempests, in more appropriate overall green paint jobs, had finally arrived in the Balkans to join British peacekeepers and replace the Mambas, which had already gotten retired, according to Think Defence . Two years later, the mine-protected vehicles also went to Afghanistan. It’s not clear exactly when the British pulled the Tempests from service, but by 2006, they were already buying substantial numbers of superior mine-resistant trucks. Tempest had actually paved the way for many of these vehicles. To rewind, in 2002, TSG had found itself on the verge of bankruptcy after having trouble securing major orders for its vehicles. It eventually became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new American company, Force Protection, Inc. Force Protection went on to market a much-improved derivative of TSG’s earlier design, which it also called the Cougar , but briefly marketed as the Typhoon. A USMC 4×4 Cougar MRAP in Iraq in 2007., USMC In 2004, the U.S. Marine Corps began buying a large number of 4×4 and 6×6 variants to meet its own urgent demands for better-protected patrol vehicles in Iraq. The U.S. Army and Air Force followed suit. In 2007, continued purchases of these, and a host of other mine-protected vehicles, got rolled together into the joint-service Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) program. In 2006, the British Army join in, purchasing a special U.K.-specific 4×4 variants known as the Ridgeback and Mastiff, respectively. This was eventually followed by orders a further modified 6×6 type with open pickup truck style rear bed, known as the Wolfhound. British Army Mastiffs., Crown Copyright Force Protection developed a number of other designs, including the Buffalo, based on Denel-Mechem’s Lion II vehicle. The Buffalo has seen modest sales, but nothing compared to the deliveries of more than 1,000 Cougar variants to more than a dozen countries. In 2011, General Dynamics Land Systems scooped up Force Protection. The two had previously worked together as part of a joint venture company called Force Dynamics. Cougars remain in service in both the United Kingdom and the United States to this day. A British Army Buffalo., Crown Copyright Now, if you have the means, you have around six days to try to place the winning bid for one of just eight Tempests the British Army ever purchased, a unique piece of history and the progenitor of the Cougar MRAP family. You’d also certainly be starting conversations wherever you might go and be well equipped to rite out a Zombie apocalypse.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 16, 2018",Taiwan’s Next Batch Of Stealthy Catamarans Will Have Serious Mine-Laying Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan says it has started construction of a trio of stealthy missile corvettes with what appear to be racks for naval mines on the stern, as well as four dedicated minelayers. Naval mining could be an extremely important tool against China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, especially in the narrow confines of the Taiwan Strait , during any future crisis. The Taiwanese announcement comes amid a recent spike in tensions with authorities on the mainland, who continue to warn they could invade the island if it seeks to declare independence. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing Wen revealed the new details about the country’s naval shipbuilding efforts during a visit to one of Lung Teh Shipbuilding’s shipyard on May 24, 2019. The country’s Navy is set to receive the three Min Chiang -class corvettes in 2025. The first of the four of the Gan Chiang -class minelayers is supposed to have arrived four years before then. The Min Chiang -class is a revision of the earlier Tou Chiang -class . Both are named after upper tributaries of the Yangtze River on the mainland. Lung Teh delivered the first Tou Chiang , effectively a prototype, in 2014. In May 2018 , Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Yen De-fa had announced that Taiwan would get a total of eight Tou Chiangs by 2025, three of which would be focused on the air defense role, while the other five would be optimized for anti-surface warfare. It is unclear if this is still the plan, given that Tsai only spoke of the construction of the first three ships. In addition, the design Lung Teh showed off at the event does not appear to have an emphasis on air defense. Based on the available concept art, the Min Chiangs will retain the core of the Tou Chiang ’s catamaran design and stealthy superstructure. The ships will also still have anti-ship missile launchers in the central superstructure, a 76mm rapid-fire gun in a turret on the bow, and a Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) toward the stern. The Tou Chiang ., Kyodo via AP But the revised configuration ship replaces the rear helicopter pad on the original corvette with what appear to be four racks to send naval mines rolling off the back of the ship. Depending on the exact nature of the system, it might be possible to readily fit these rack onto the flight deck of the existing Tou Chiang and other future configurations based on that design. At present, the Taiwanese Navy has no dedicated mine-laying ships. Various vessels, including its larger amphibious landing craft, do have a secondary mine-laying role. Existing mine options include bottom-lying mines, which are better suited to shallow water areas, and so-called Encapsulated Torpedo, or CAPTOR, types. The latter is, as the name implies, a torpedo inside a self-contained launch tube that has various sensors to detect ship or submarine passing by, after which it would release the weapon. You can read more about both of these general classes of mines here . Taiwan’s government-operated National Chung Shan Institute for Science and Technology is also working on new shallow- and deep-water mines, which it hopes to have ready for service by 2021, which would coincide with the arrival of the first of the smaller Gan Chiang minelayers. There are also plans for some form of new “ self-propelled ” mine, which could be an improved CAPTOR type. An existing Taiwanese No.1 Wan Xiang CAPTOR mine., 玄史生 via Wikimedia The previously announced air defense configuration was supposed to take this space and install a four-cell vertical launch system array. Each cell would contain quad-packed Tien Chien IIN , or Sky Sword IIN, medium-range surface-to-air missiles, for a total of 16 missiles, according to the earlier reports . It is possible that the artwork is actually of the anti-surface warfare variant, but the only details about that configuration in the past were that it would be able to carry 16 Hsiung Feng II or III – Brave Wind II and III – anti-ship missiles. There was no mention of mines in either case. A Hsiung Feng III supersonic anti-ship missile., 玄史生 via Wikimedia Combined with the announcement about the construction of the smaller Gan Chiang minelayers, also named after a river in China, this would all seem to point to shift in priority, at least in part, to expanding the Taiwanese Navy’s mining capabilities in the near term. Naval mining was an important component of Taiwan’s Overall Defense Concept , which it rolled out in 2017. This makes good sense in many ways, given its proximity to the mainland. The Taiwan Strait is only around 110 miles wide and the ability to rapidly fill it with naval mines could wreak havoc on the People’s Liberation Army Navy ’s (PLAN) ability to operate there, slowing them down and making them vulnerable to counterattack. Naval mines also generally have an outsized impact relative to their cost given that clearing them is a complex and dangerous process that requires significant time and resources . The Chinese have also vastly expanded their capabilities to launch attacks on the island from any direction in the past two decades. Naval mines could help to channel those forces into a more limited number of areas, making it easier for Taiwan’s notably smaller military to best focus its resources. Taiwanese officials have described the Tou Chiang design in the past as being a key “asymmetric” weapon. The corvettes, in general, offer a way to reduce the strain on larger warships during an actual conflict, as well as to provide additional escorts for those surface actions groups that are cheaper to build and operate. Whatever the final mix of missile corvettes looks like in the end, that announcement coincides with a surge in tensions between Taiwan and China in recent months, which has also drawn in Taiwan’s principal ally, the United States. Just on May 22, 2019 , the U.S. Navy sent two unspecified ships through the Taiwan Strait, one of a number of such transits this year already , which are seen as a show of force in support of Taiwan. The U.S. and Chinese governments are themselves locked in an increasingly serious trade war and the countries are at odds over a host of other issues, including Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea . The present state of affairs has only underscored the limitations of Taiwan’s aging military, as a whole. The country is in the process of upgrading its F-16 Viper fighter jet fleet and is now looking to acquire more modern main battle tanks , among a host of other initiatives . When it comes to modernizing the country’s Navy, the announcement about the corvette and minelayer construction programs came just weeks after President Tsai presided over a ground-breaking ceremony for an all-new shipyard to produce a new class of indigenous diesel-electric submarines. The Taiwanese Navy has just four submarines at present, two of which are World War II-era boats the country received from the United States in the 1970s that are now relegated to training duties. A model of the proposed new domestic design shows clear influences from the Dutch Zwaardvis -class . Taiwan’s existing pair of Hai Lung -class submarines are derived from this design, as well. There are limited details about the planned features for Taiwan’s new boats, such as whether they will include advanced Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems, which would drastically increase the time it can stay submerged. A model of Taiwan’s proposed future diesel-electric submarine., Kyodo via AP But questions remain about whether Taiwan has the resources to actually pursue all of these major military modernization programs, especially with regards to its Navy. The country’ submarine production schedule is particularly aggressive, with the goal of having the shipyard, which is just now itself under construction, deliver the first of eight new boats by 2024. Cost considerations could certainly help explain the shift in focus toward naval mining. Taiwan would hardly be the first small Navy to go this route in order to present credible obstacles against larger potential opponents. Still, a focus on asymmetric capabilities notwithstanding, Taiwan simply does not have the industrial capacity to match that of mainland China. If Lung Teh does end up building all eight new corvettes based on the Tou Chiang design by 2025, it will only be building one or two of these small ships each year, while the Chinese churn out significant numbers of submarines and major surface combatants , including multiple examples of the new advanced Type 055 destroyer . That’s to say nothing of its ability to produce smaller ships, including the PLAN’s fleet of more than 80 Type 22 Houbei -class missile boats. China recently put many of its latest ships on display as part of a huge maritime parade to the PLAN’s 70th anniversary. All told, Taiwanese officials certainly seem to appreciate the ever-growing disparity in their military capabilities versus those of the PLA. But whether or not all of these modernization efforts will actually come to fruition as planned remains to be seen. For the Taiwanese Navy, there now seems to be a serious push toward fielding new naval mining capabilities in the near term in order to challenge the growing capabilities of their significantly larger opponent across the Strait.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday we did a deep dive on a new jet-black, six-door, dome-packing truck that has appeared at the rear guard of the president’s sprawling motorcade . We concluded that this vehicle was a new ‘Roadrunner’—the Secret Service’s code name for the White House Communications Agency’s communications, networking, and command vehicle that follows the presidential limousine everywhere. Basically a rolling highly secure satellite communications gateway and wifi router, this vehicle is critical to the motorcade’s functions and to the Command In Chief’s ability to stay in touch at all times. Now we have much more to report about this mysterious vehicle and where it came from. The truck was produced by The Armored Group and features a large, almost sci-fi like command station with a large video screen in the back. In fact, the rear of the vehicle is built as its own sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF), sealed and hardened to exacting standards from external electronic emissions. By building a SCIF inside the truck, non-hardened components can be installed, thus saving time and cost, and improving the vehicle’s overall capabilities and flexibility. The Armored Group Just three occupants are carried in the truck’s six-door custom cabin. The Armored Group describes the vehicle as such: “The Mobile Communications Vehicle (MCV) is built on a Ford Super Duty truck platform modified to maximize payload with an overall appearance of a six door sport utility vehicle with air ride suspension. The MCV includes a structurally reinforced 5 slice antenna platform that incorporates an omni-directional satellite mount. The MCV was designed to protect and process all levels of communication data through a network of cable trays.  The walls of the vehicle have seven layers of EMI shielding.  The vehicle will be a Tempest Chamber Certified rolling SCIF which means off-the-shelf hardware can be installed in standard equipment racks.  An extensive effort was made to integrate advanced RF, sound, and heat countermeasures including a 32,000 BTU HVAC system. The MCV will have a 4G Air Worthiness Certification and can be deployed worldwide to mission areas via enclosed semi-trailers and cargo aircraft.” The Armored Group The Armored Group goes on to give the specs of the highly-modified vehicle’s payload bay and support systems: Interior Construction 1000 lbs.

The Armored Group The Armored Group makes all types of armored vans, SUVs, limos, sedans, and special purpose vehicles, including this very wicked looking SWAT Suburban . The company is a prolific purveyor of armored SUVs to the U.S federal government, from Special Operations Command to the Department of Justice, and most notably the State Department, which has consumed such vehicles at an alarming, if not wasteful rate .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2019",This 120MM Gun Built into a Shipping Container Is Pretty Damn Genius,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Finnish defense contractor Patria has adapted its NEMO 120mm smooth-bore, gyro stabilized motor gun system to fit into an easily transportable shipping container. I did a writeup all about the innovative NEMO , a lightweight version of Patria’s Advanced Mortar System, a couple years ago. In the past, the system has been showcased as integrated directly into land combat vehicles and on littoral combat boats. But now NEMO comes in a self contained “plug-and-play” container. Patria says it is the biggest containerized gun system on the planet. Dare you disagree? Everything is all fitted inside the container, from the gun turret, its ammo handling system, magazine and power supply to its operations station. The same “box” can be mounted on a vessel’s deck, on a pier, on a flatbed truck or sat directly on the ground. From those positions, NEMO can be put to work in fire modes that are direct (like a tank) and indirect (like an artillery piece). In the latter, it can have five rounds impact a target area all at once via Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) firing solutions calculated by the gun’s computer system. The NEMO can fire a three round burst in 12 seconds, and has maximum firing rate of ten rounds per minute and a sustained firing rate of seven rounds per minute—a lot of firepower in a small package. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DUsc_DGoAwI The container the system is built around is very similar to a standard 20 foot container, although it is 23.5 inches lower. A cover goes on the top of it to conceal the turret during transport. With the cover on the container has the same dimensions as a standard shipping container. A tubular structure has been fitted under the container’s skin to give the it better rigidity in order to absorb the recoil and vibration from the NEMO gun system. Different levels of armor protection can also be added to the container depending on the threat environment and the weight restrictions of its host vehicle, if it has one at all. , A cutaway of the containerized NEMO system. , Inside it holds 100 rounds of various 120mm rounds, and is operated by three people—two loaders and one gunner who is also the commander. A self-contained air conditioning system provides environmental control and protection against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) attacks. This modular design allows for NEMO to be deployed on multi-role vessels, even highly maneuverable littoral combat boats., Patria The coolest thing about this is you can just stick it wherever you need it, whether that be on an oil platform or on a maneuvering ground vehicle or patrol boat. This also means that a military can save a lot of money by not having to purchase larger amounts of NEMO systems that would otherwise be fully integrated into their host vehicles. As such, it also means these vehicles can be freed up for other tasks when not being deployed with NEMO onboard. The concept just offers far more flexibility and affordability for a large variety of mission sets that NEMO could be applied to as opposed procuring discreet, fully integrated individual weapon systems. The modular NEMO container system mounted on a flatbed combat truck. NEMO’s barrel is stabalized allowing for shooting on the move. , Patria The trend toward containerized weapon systems is a somewhat controversial one, but it has continued to grow in recent years. Anti-ship and cruise missiles may be the most eyebrow raising examples container-mounted weaponry, a concept that Russia has pioneered in recent years. Just recently the Norwegian-built multi-role Naval Strike Missile has also been put forward in
 a containerized variant as well. Other shipping container-based weapons concepts have included rocket systems and armed remote sentry systems . But what makes the containerized NEMO so intriguing is that it is not just a disguise for a stand-off missile launcher, but a persistent weapons system that can be used for low intensity conflicts and security keeping as well as higher-intensity warfare. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mbUU_9bOcnM This modular NEMO system was originally built for the UAE, and input from their military was integral in its final configuration. But Patria clearly sees a larger market for the system, and in an era where sea basing and distributed lethality are all the rage, and where modular and multi-role anything and everything is what seems to get funding, this system could be a huge hit.

By 2014, a somewhat obscure program to turn an A-10 Warthog into a storm chasing laboratory the likes of which the world had never seen before had begun to make headlines, and for good reason. I was just as excited as anyone to see the legendary tank-busting attack jet finally migrate to the civilian world in the name of science.

Spurred by a $13M grant from the National Science Foundation, a menagerie of stakeholders was hard at work making their dreams of the ultimate storm penetrating flying machine a reality. It was all one heck of a storyâ€”that is until it wasn’t.Â By the end of 2016, the whole project had evaporated from the public sphere without as much as a whimper. How could such an exciting, promising, important, and highly publicized project that was well along the path to being realized simply disappear? Last winter I set out to answer this exact question, here’s what I found out. A Tough Act To Follow What would become known internally as the SPA-10 Thunderhog was actually intended to be the successor of a humble yet remarkable aircraft whose decades-long job was to penetrate into some of the nastiest storms Mother Nature had to offer. Compared to the flying hurricane hunters that are so well covered by the mainstream media, this aircraft was far less glamorous, but also an incredibly important scientific tool, and far more robust.Â The idea of building an airplane to study storms by penetrating through them, and especially those that feature heavy hail, dates back to shortly after World War II. For decades, it was thought of as an impossible proposition at worst and an extremely dangerous one at best. But by the mid-1960s, one man, in particular, was advancing the case for and plausibility of such an aircraft. That man was Paul MacCready.Â With some money from the National Science Foundation, he and his associates executed a study on which aircraft from either military or civilian stocks would be the best fit for such a punishing mission. He first came to the conclusion that the WWII era famed Douglas SBD-2 Dauntless dive-bomber was the best fit, but when he factored in the cost of operation and sustainability, the North American T-28 Trojan trainer stood out above all other alternatives.Â The SBD-2 was originally selected by MacCready’s team, but the World War II era aircraft was long out of service and supportability would be a major issue., Public DOmain/Wikicommons Regardless of the aircraft type, one factor was undeniableâ€”no aircraft could survive high-speed impacts of three-inch size hail. The plane chosen would have to be heavily modified with armor and thus be able to lug its hardened self through gale-force winds and walls of flying ice. The slower the aircraft could safely fly, the less armor it would need, so high-speed was definitely not a high priority or even a benefit when choosing an airframe. With the results of his study in hand, MacCready was granted funds by the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences’ NSF-funded Hailstorm Models Project to acquire the T-28 and modify it for storm research. Williams Aircraft Company spent over a year customizing the ex-Navy Trojan trainer. In the end, the work done to the aircraft was incredibly extensive. It was dressed with copious amounts of plating, its windscreen and canopy heavily modified, and its engine partially redesigned. You can read all about the work done to the one-of-a-kind flying machine here .Â T-28B while in service with VT-2 in the 1970s. , National Museum Of Naval Aviation By 1969, the aircraft began busting through hailstorms at altitudes up to 23,000 feet and withstanding impacts of hailstones three inches in diameter hitting the plane at a combined speed of 225 mph. After being passed to the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in latter 1969, the aircraft began taking on tougher and tougher storms. Some additional modifications were applied, including an enhanced wing spar and an upgraded radial engine to provide additional power. Throughout the 1970s, the hail-proof plane made hundreds of runs through storm clouds reliably proving that the concept was viable and the science products it produced were highly valuable to better understand storms and the hail and other atmospheric effects they produced. The T-28 went on to fly missions into countless storms collecting all types of data.Â The armored T-28 could carry all types of pods and instruments. It could also take damage and get repaired quickly to fly again., NCAR In 1987, the National Science Foundation and South Dakota School Of Mine Technology agreed to operate the aircraft cooperatively as the National Airborne Research Facility. Through the latter 1980s, 1990s, and up until being finally retired from service without replacement in 2005, the armored Trojan supported 18 major projects that focused on rain, hail, atmospheric electricity, detection of convective turbulence, cloud seeding in storms, and advanced radar data work.Â Over the storm chasing T-28’s 35-year career, it had truly morphed into a multi-role flying meteorological laboratory. I don’t think anyone who brought the plane to life in 1968 would have believed it would still be doing important scientific researchâ€”literally providing potentially life-saving dataâ€”nearly 35 years after it was conceived. To think that it flew into the absolute worst conditions for an aircraft for all those years, being pummeled by hail and struck repeatedly by lightning ( read about that here ), yet it survived to be retired in good shape is really a testament to MacCready’s original vision. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xPQ5-QhLhtI There is a special section for the storm chasing T-28, registered N10WX, on the T-28 Trojan Foundation’s website. Part of a passage from pilot and meteorologist Tom Warner who flew the aircraft towards the end of its career reads:Â It is important to point out that both Charlie and I felt that every time we penetrated storms, we reinforced the idea that a thunderstorm is no place for an airplane. No other plane in the world could survive in the environment we flew in, and it was only because of the armor plating (to withstand hail up to 3 inches in diameter), structural reinforcement and bulletproof canopy that enabled us to return safely each mission. Charlie used to say, “The aircraft knows how to get through a thunderstorm, you just have to stay with the aircraft.” For us, it was about keeping the right side up and the engine running. Some storms made this quite challenging.” The T-28 was an amazingly useful aircraft but it was oldâ€”55 years of age at the time of its retirement with a whopping 2,000 in-storm hours in its logsâ€”and it was limited as to the profiles it could fly and the loads it could carry, and thus it hit something of a plateau as to the new science it could provide. Even though saying goodbye to the Trojan was tough, those engaged in the project had their eyes set on a much more capable and modern storm penetrating machine that could build upon the N10WX’s stellar legacy. N10WX had a rocky retirement. Apparently, it was sold and the new owner parted it out, but thankfully what was left of it found a home at the National Weather Museum in Norman, Oklahoma where people can learn all about this incredible little plane and the work it did during its three and a half decades long scientific career. , National Weather Museum The Right Plane For The Job The need for a more capable storm penetrating aircraft really dates back to the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was becoming clear that the Trojan had its limitations and new technologies could be put to work over a much wider flight envelope by a hardy aircraft with higher performance. By the late-1990s, the A-10 Thunderbolt was already being eyed for this exact role and the reasoning behind its final selection is abundantly clear. The same attributes that make the aircraft so effective on the battlefield would also make for an incredible storm penetrating scientific flying machine.Â The A-10 was born tough, survivable, and able to operate with a relatively small logistical footprint., USAF The Warthog was built to soak up hits from anti-aircraft artillery that would shatter other tactical jets. The aircraft’s honeycomb construction is designed to withstand strikes from small arms fire, shrapnel, and up to 23mm cannon fire. Critical parts of the jet, including the ‘titanium bathtub’ surrounding the cockpit, can withstand direct hits from 57mm anti-aircraft artillery shells. It also has redundant systems arranged on either side of the jet and its high-bypass turbofan engines are reliable, fuel efficient, and have a higher capacity to handle foreign object ingestionsâ€”like tennis ball sized hail. As a result, the armor modifications needed for an A-10 storm penetrating aircraft would be less extensive than the ones required on the T-28.Â LEFT: Kim “Killer Chick” Campbell inspects damage to her A-10 after limping the jet home in one piece during a particularly violent Operation Iraq Freedom mission. RIGHT: A-10’s were built to brush off hits from ground fire and to be quickly repairable. Here an airman repairs damage to a Warthog after an Iraqi Freedom mission., USAF The A-10’s flight controls are relatively simple and its electronic components are shielded for operations in a nuclear environmentâ€”a good thing when it comes to withstanding lightning strikes. The rugged jet is also supportable by smaller ground crews operating in less than pristine conditions and can carry a wide variety of stores on its 11 hardpoints. The huge compartment for its massive gun, once removed, would provide ample interior space for mission-specific gear and the hydraulic drive system that spun the GAU-8 Avenger cannon could be adapted to generate large amounts of auxiliary electric power.Â The A-10 was built with rapid repairability of battle damage in the field in mind. This could include replacing damaged panels and structures with new ones or literally filling holes punched in its skin. These attributes are ideal for a storm penetrating aircraft that would take some damage from hail and especially from lightning strikes.Â USAF Its straight wings also meant that it could penetrate storms at slower speeds than its swept wing counterparts. At the same time, its ability to fly at much higher speeds when not flying into storms could be leveraged to do what the T-28 couldn’tâ€”forward-deploy to distant locales or chase storms far from its base. But maybe most important of all is that the Warthog could fly at 35,000 feetâ€”something its predecessor couldn’t come close to. This opens up new possibilities for important scientific research that has never been realized before.Â Even expanding such an aircraft’s role to studying other extreme atmospheric conditions, like those that exist over forest fires, was a real possibility. But still, being able to study how rain, wind, hail, and lighting develop from inside a storm would be its primary and largely exclusive mission set. Basically, the A-10 was better designed from the get-go to take on nasty storms than any other jet on the planetâ€”but there would still be technical hurdles. You can find this complete, earlier brief on the SPA-10 concept here . , UNOLS Birth Of The Thunderhog After the Trojan was retired, the gap left when it came to a flying storm penetrating research facility was apparent and work to acquire an A-10 to take over the role began. You can read this entire case made for the project that dates back to 2006. By 2009, the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) at the Naval Postgraduate School was granted an A-10 on loan from the USAF for the Storm Penetrating Aircraft (SPA) mission. In 2010, North Dakota School of Mines and Technology (NDSM&T) was selected by the National Science Foundation to work with CIRPAS cooperatively on the program. CIRPAS would help with operating the aircraft and managing the operational side of the program while NDSM&T of would work the science side of the program as it had with the T-28. Â Everything was looking bright for the newly minted SPA-10 Thunderhog. A-10C serial number 80-0212, the 562nd A-10 ever built, was selected for the program and partially demilitarized by the USAF before being transferred to Zivko Aeronautics in Oklahoma City in late 2013. The plan was to have additional military systems removed and replaced with their commercial counterpartsâ€”including some of its avionics. The Warthog’s 20 foot long GAU-8 Avenger cannon was removed and the aircraft was rebalanced with added ballast. Then major mission-specific modification work and testing began.Â The A-10C 80-0212 arriving in Oklahoma for modifications in 2013., Andrew Detwiler This would include the installation of anti-icing systems, additional lightning protection, and conversion of the gun bay to a partial mission equipment space with ample power generation by adapting the gun’s hydraulic drive unit. Wiring the aircraft for science payloads, onboard computers, line-of-sight and satellite data-link systems, and the addition of various instrumentation accommodations, including spaces for expendable sensors to be dropped into storms, were also to be part of the complex conversion process. Even the A-10’s muzzle protrusion was eyed as a place to mount a hardened sensor system. Zivko, NPS, CIRPAS A number of carbon fiber scientific payload pods were also to be developed and would need to be tested. Even though the A-10 was notoriously rugged, hail was still a concern. The USAF provided spare wing leading edges for ice cannon testing to see if any additional armoring would be required. A number of smaller areas would need limited fortification as well. You can read a risk assessment for the modification program here .Â As for who would fly the aircraft, the team wanted an A-10 Air National Guard pilot who would remain current on the aircraft through the Guard, saving the program a lot of money and complication in the process. You can read a complete powerpoint brief on the modifications intended for the aircraft as well as all the science it was slated to take part in here .Â The SPA-10 during the first stage of the modifications process Oklahoma. , Andrew Detwiler By 2014, the A-10 storm penetrator conversion process was moving along. The Naval Postgraduate School even began stockpiling spare A-10 parts in anticipation of operating the aircraft. Still, a lot of challenging modification work still lay ahead, but technical difficulties would soon become the least of the program’s worries.Â Storm Clouds Gather Originally, when the program was just beginning around the turn of the decade, it was thought that the conversion would be completed quickly, with the aircraft entering into flight testing around 2014-2015, but that wasn’t the case. In 2015, the timetable was pushed back at least two years and the program dragged on and cost soared as technical challenges persisted.Â These included the need to fit the A-10’s inner wing sections with fixed ‘droop’ leading edges in place of its maneuvering slats. The issue was that ice could make it so the slats would not be able to activate. Also, without a deicing system on those leading edges, ice could accumulate and break off in huge chunks, flying right into the engines and causing major damage, or worse. The idea was that the inner leading edges could be replaced with a fixed, drooped leading edges and equipped with a deicing system. In effect, this would solve both issues.Â NPS/SDSM&T/NSF Apparently, the drooped leading edge modification had been studied before by the USAF, but getting it designed, installed, and flight tested was a complicated and expensive endeavor, especially considering it would be done for just one aircraft. Other problems persisted as well. Just getting clean, continuous power from a generator driven by the A-10’s hydraulic gun drive unit was a challenging undertaking. Eventually, this issue was solved though. All of the storm penetrating A-10’s technical issues could be overcome, but doing so would take time and moneyâ€”two things the program was increasingly running short of. And with a large portion of the required modifications still needing to be done, where additional money would come from was beginning to be a question of growing importance.Â The 80-0212 after arriving in Oklahoma but before receiving major modifications. , SDSM&T The biggest problem the program would face wasn’t technological, though. Instead, it had to do with how exactly the aircraft would be operated and how much it would actually cost to do so. With the original grant now looking woefully insufficient, the idea that the aircraft may have to be operated and maintained to the USAF’s standards was crushing. The issue was that nobody aside from the USAF had ever owned and operated an A-10, and especially a highly modified one that flies through storms. Getting everyone to agree on just how the aircraft would be maintained and flown became increasingly contentious and convoluted. But the aftermath of a number of cataclysmic shifts at the Naval Postgraduate School, including weathering an internal scandal among its leadership and major changes to how it managed cooperative research programs, would lead to the school dropping out of the program altogether. This served a crushing blow to the already troubled program.Â With this major change to the program’s architecture, the issues with operating the A-10 would go from complex to nearly insurmountable. The Navy’s involvement was key in the USAF loaning the jet out for the mission in the first place. Under that regime, at least the DoD was still managing the program and the plane’s operation, to a certain degree. The question of who would, or even could, fill the Naval Postgraduate School’s shoes became an increasingly pressing and downright critical question. By late 2016, the publicity around the program had evaporated. The once promising initiative that had fascinated many across the country had largely imploded. The aircraft, which was well along in its modification process, but still had a number of developmental hoops to leap through, was ferried from Oklahoma to Rocky Mountain Region Airport in Broomfield, Colorado and placed in the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCAR) hangar there.Â The half-modified SPA-10 after arriving in Broomfield, Colorado in 2016. Shortly after this shot was taken the aircraft was put into storage at the NARF hangar at the airport. This is the last shot we have found of the SPA-10. Work that still needs to be completed includes finishing the de-icing system and other aeronautical modifications, provide for installation of data acquisition systems and mounting of instrumentation on the aircraft, and modernize the cockpit avionics and communications., Andrew Detwiler When the aircraft went into storage in late 2016, it was thought that the National Science Foundation would make a decision as to what to do with it within six to nine months. Nearly two years later, it has done nothing of the sort.Â Flying Lab In Limbo During my research, I reached out to the National Science Foundation for comment on the program. At first, they were less than forthcoming with information. Their initial response read: The National Science Foundation supported the operation of a storm penetration aircraft (SPA) for about 30 years using a T-28 aircraft, owned by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, which was retired in 2004. The community need for this capability continues and was re-affirmed at a recent workshop focused on observations in convective and turbulent environments.  Any aircraft used for such purpose must be modified for safe operation, including hardening of vulnerable surfaces, lightning protection and de-icing, and to carry scientific instrumentation, which entails development of a payload power system, air-to-ground communications, hardware to carry instrumentation, etc. It is anticipated that a future SPA would carry instrumentation to measure cloud and precipitation properties, storm electrification, and chemical composition. Once modifications such as these are complete, a future SPA would be made available to the scientific community for use in studying cloud and storm environments, including severe thunderstorms and hurricanes, to address unanswered questions about the development, evolution and impacts of severe weather. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is considering options to meet the scientific and safety requirements for an operational SPA. The considerations include cost to achieve readiness as well as a good understanding of operational costs needed to meet the scientific goals. Among the options under consideration is use of an A-10 aircraft on loan from the US Air Force. NSF expects the process of aircraft modification, airworthiness testing and operator identification to be such that it will be several years before the SPA reaches operational readiness. After pushing back on this bizarre answer, which made it sound like the SPA-10 was still just an idea and not an airplane sitting idle in a hangar in Colorado, here was their reply: The National Science Foundation (NSF) started this project with The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) operated by the United States Navy. A commitment of $13 million dollars was provided to NPS for the modification of an aircraft, specifically an A-10 model, to render it an effective storm penetrating aircraft. This type of modification had never been done before. During the course of the project, after making progress, NPS made a determination that it could no longer participate in the project due to internal grant policies. At that point, NSF had a better understanding of the full scope, including associated costs needed to complete the project. Informed with this new information, NSF believes the prudent course of action is to initiate an analysis of the situation, and reassess the scientific goals and associated costs of meeting those goals. Any future funding would be subject to clearance by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. I checked with a number of sources, including airport operations in Broomfield, and the half-finished SPA-10 Thunderhog is still sitting in the NCAR’s hangar to this very day. Supposedly, it gets occasional engine runs to keep the aircraft from degrading to the point where flying it again would be highly problematic and very costly.Â The entire endeavor is clearly a boondoggle, but really, it shouldn’t be. We are talking about critical science here that saves lives and prevents major damage, especially to aircraft, including those owned by the USAF. Storms, and especially hail , do millions of dollars in damage to USAF and other service’s aircraft and property every year.Â Storms do major damage to USAF aircraft every year. Take these F-16s at AMARG for example!, USAF The problem of who operates this aircraft and how could be solved by the USAF taking on the mission instead of just being on hand to provide operational and engineering advice. Considering the federal government already blew many millions of dollars on the airplane and there is a highly experienced and proven team at NDSM&T that can accelerate the science, finishing the aircraft and putting it work is money very wisely spent.Â The very idea that such an important laboratory needs to be created by cobbling together a team on shoestring funding is sad in itself. But this is science that really does impact the USAF’s mission. Surely there is room in a $716B defense budget to at least chip in substantially to see that the SPA-10 gets to execute its mission for the greater good? By having the USAF fly and maintain the aircraft it would solve so many problems, and maybe then the NSF could focus on funding the science side of the program exclusively.Â Why you don't fly through a hail storm…if you can avoid it, that is… I wish I had the mishap photos I saw of a VS-28 Viking that passed through a hail storm….even greater damage all along the leading edges of the wings and engine cowling… (Harley Montelongo) pic.twitter.com/MX9UaQZPbu — AncientSubHunter ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸŒ» (@AncientSubHunt) June 9, 2018 The bottom line here is that SPA-10 wasn’t a bad idea. It just ran into major execution hurdles and was underfunded from the get-go. This can be fixed. But until then, the fate of Thunderhog remains uncertain at best and downright dismal at worst. According to our sources, some of the remnants of the SPA-10 team recently traveled to Hill AFB to discuss the jet’s future with the new head of USAF’s A-10 systems program office. The exact results of that engagement remain unclear, but it seems more to do with keeping the USAF from repossessing the aircraft than from getting the program funded and back on track. And there definitely is still a need. A scientific workshop that occurred in Boulder, Colorado in May of 2017 and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research resulted in a final report titled “Requirements for In Situ and Remote Sensing Capabilities in Convective and Turbulent Environments.” It concluded the following: “The instrumentation of a storm-penetrating manned aircraft that can withstand severe turbulence, hail, and lightning strikes is greatly desired by investigators studying continental convection, including severe storms. Such an aircraft would allow measurement of turbulence, 3D wind, trace gases, aerosol, the electric field, and thermodynamic and cloud physical variables along its flight path. A manned aircraft is currently the only reliable way of making such measurements. A US Air Force A-10 aircraft is currently being evaluated by NSF for this role. The need for extensive aircraft modifications without Supplemental Type Certificates, and the lack of other A-10s for civilian use, make this an expensive and high-risk project, but the stakes are high for those studying severe convection.” USAF Andrew Detwiler, who recently retired from his position as a professor of physics at the South Dakota School of Mines and who was a lead player on the SPA-10 program and someone The War Zone spoke with extensively while developing this story, summed up why the Thunderhog is so important while speaking to Oklahoma City’s News9 back in 2015 : “The idea is to get something into a storm to see things that you can’t see from outside the storm using radar… We’re doing it so we can understand more about how hail develops in a storm, how lightning develops, how tornadoes develop, all the different things that these storms contain… You need something inside the storm to actually close the gap and understand it completely.” As it sits now, that gap hangs wide open for the meteorological science community and if nobody steps in to save the Thunderhog there is little chance that it will ever be closed in the foreseeable future.Â Author’s Note: A very special thanks to Andrew Detwiler, Â previously of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and Haflidi Johnson , of the Naval Postgraduate School, for taking the time to discuss the SPA-10 program with us as part of the research that was done to develop this story.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There are very few details as yet, but there has been a massive explosion near Egypt’s Cairo International Airport. The blast was loud enough for residents across the Egyptian capital to hear it and photos already show a huge cloud of smoke rising from the site that one can see from many blocks away. The incident occurred late on July 12, 2018, local time. According to Reuters , officials had suspended all flights from the airport while they investigate the cause of the blast, but Egyptian member of parliament Mustafa Bakri later wrote on Twitter that normal operations had resumed . Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Younis Al Masry, a former Egyptian Air Force officer who only took up the post in June 2018 during a cabinet shuffle, confirmed that the fuel dump has exploded, but offered no additional information. Though there is nothing to indicate clearly what happened as yet, Egyptian security forces are in the midst of battling ISIS-aligned terrorists who are based in the Sinai Peninsula. In 2015, the faction managed to smuggle a bomb on board Metrojet Flight 9268 before it left Sharm El Sheikh International Airport on the peninsula, which led to the destruction of the aircraft in flight and the deaths of all 244 passengers and crew on board. Update: 3:40pm PST— Egyptian authorities have now confirmed that the explosion occurred in a fuel storage area within a chemical plant nearby and that the resulting fire was under control. A spokesperson for the Egyptian Army blamed the incident on “high temperatures,” but declined to offer further details. Authorities have not released the name of the company operating the site, either. Update: 6:40pm PST— Egyptian security forces now say that 12 people were injured in the blast, but there are no reports so far of any fatalities. The name of the company in charge of the facility remains unknown, as well, but new information says that it sits inside cantonment that the Egyptian Army controls . We will continue to update this post as more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 25, 2019",The Blue Angels Have Retired Their Beloved Fat Albert C-130 Without A Replacement,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy Flight Demonstration Team’s beloved C-130T cargo plane (BuNo 164763), better known by its Fat Albert nickname, has taken to the skies for the last time. The iconic blue, white, and gold Hercules transport was flown from the Blue Angels’ home base at NAS Pensacola in Florida to Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas where it will spend the rest of its life as a ground training aid. Since this particular airframe took over the role of Fat Albert in 2002, it has flown over 30,000 hours in support of the Blue Angels mission and performed in front of millions of people at air show locations all over the world. It was also the last Navy or Marine C-130s to execute a jet-assisted takeoff —a highlight of the Blue Angels’ shows up until 2009 when surplus JATO bottle stocks finally ran out. The Navy, which also manages the Marine Corps’ aircraft fleet, has no replacement for the aircraft at this time. The service was officially set to purchase a single second-hand C-130J from the Royal Air Force to replace Fat Albert, but the deal still hasn’t been finalized. This means that the team will have to rely on external military transports for all their movements, in addition to chartered aircraft. It will be interesting to see how the team, which has a ridiculously demanding schedule, handles this arrangement. In the past, a fleet C-130T was loaned to the Blue Angels when Fat Albert was receiving deep maintenance. These aircraft, which wore the standard gray paint scheme, were commonly referred to as ‘Ernie.’ But at this time, even this doesn’t sound like it’s going to happen. USN The Navy and Marine Corps’ ‘legacy’ C-130s have been the source of major concern in recent years after a horrific crash in Mississippi in 2017 . This event prompted the replacement of propellers on the entire fleet, among other upgrades—a program that is still ongoing—thus limiting the capacity of the force to support key logistical duties critical to the Navy and Marine Corps’ operations. Fat Albert didn’t just move the team and its gear around from location to location, it also served as the high-profile unit’s on-demand airlift service, often shagging urgently needed spare parts and other items on short notice because ‘the show must go on.’ It even carried the bodies of fallen comrades home when disaster struck. Without an aircraft dedicated to the mission, losing such a capability over the long term could have an impact on the team’s readiness and ability to perform throughout the year, not even counting the loss of a major part—and a crowd favorite— of the Blue Angels’ high-energy routine. Still, the team says Fat Albert will live on, it just isn’t exactly sure when and in what form. They are taking applications for a Fat Albert crew for the 2020-2021 season, but exactly what aircraft will fulfill the role and where it will come from remains a higher-level decision that is still in process at this time. It wouldn’t be too surprising if it gets pushed back further considering it didn’t happen already even as the current Fat Albert’s expiration date was fast approaching. USN If everything goes as planned and Fat Albert returns in some form within the next couple of years, it could result in the most anticipated Blue Angels air show season in memory. The team is slated to receive F/A-18E/F Super Hornets around that time and the conversion will also come with a revised routine. You can read all about the Blue Angels’ new mount and the process of transitioning to it in this past article of ours. With all this in mind, it’s abundantly clear that major changes for the Blues are definitely on the horizon. Let’s just hope Fat Albert will be there to help make those changes a success.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 67th Special Operations Squadron (67th SOS) ‘Night Owls’ based at RAF Mildenhall in England put on one hell of a display through the U.K. countryside recently with four of their MC-130J Commando II aircraft snaking along one of the low-level routes that run through Wales, also generally referred to as Mach Loop . The video was posted on Twitter by photographer Peter Lewis. If it doesn’t automatically propagate below, you can click here to watch it on Twitter. USAF MC-130 pic.twitter.com/z0I2zaoQLM — peter lewis (@welshi233) May 22, 2019 Although it is fairly common to see fighters and other tactical aircraft rocketing through the low-level routes around Wales in groups, formations of multiple large aircraft, like the C-130, are less common, and especially an entire division (four aircraft) at once. MC-130J Commando II., Lockheed Martin The forward-based 67th SOS is one of the USAF’s premier special operations squadrons. It focuses on providing aerial refueling and forward arming and refueling points (FARP) to rotary-wing special operations aircraft under the cover of darkness, as well as more general special operations transport duties. These missions can include infiltrating into or near enemy airspace via low-altitude ‘nap of the earth’ flying tactics. With that in mind, practicing low-level flying and navigating skills is absolutely essential to being able to accomplish the unit’s high-risk, high-stakes mission set upon short notice. This makes the local low-level routes that the U.K. has to offer, some of the finest in the world , very convenient for the squadron. MC-130J refuels a CV-22 in total darkness. CV-22s are also based at RAF Mildenhall. , USAF The MC-130J, is still relatively new to the unit, with the last of the Night Owl’s venerable MC-130Ps leaving the squadron in 2014.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-21 Raider is coming to Edwards Air Force Base , when exactly remains unknown, but recent satellite imagery shows a number of new structures have been built over the last eight months at the historic installation’s South Base facility. This is where the B-21 program, and potentially others that are part of a family of next-generation systems related to it, are set to be tested in the coming years. This was the case as far back as 2011. During a visit to Edwards AFB at that time, I noticed the B-1B and B-52H bomber contingent had been relocated to the base’s main apron after calling South Base home for decades . This move was done to accommodate classified programs including the B-21. The B-2 test contingent at the base will presumably continue its life-long tenancy at South Base, as well. The red arrow points to the South Base complex, part of the sprawling Edwards Air Force., Google Earth The new additions to South Base (Birk Flight Test Facility) that began construction this year include a red-toned elongated shelter on the apron in front of huge hangar facility that once housed the YAL-1 Airborne Laser and other programs in the past. The structure measures roughly 220 feet wide and 100 feet deep—the perfect size to accommodate the stealthy B-21 or even a B-2 with plenty of room to spare. The original low-slung B-2 hangar is seen just to the right of the old Airborne Laser building in the satellite image below.

The red arrows correspond to the new structures described in this article., Planet Labs CC BY-SA 4.0, red added by Thewarzone.com The same area photographed in September of 2015. , Google Earth In addition, a new large aircraft shelter has been built on one of the bomber hardstands along South Base’s northern ramp. It is far larger than the aforementioned red colored aircraft shelter located just to its west, measuring roughly 220 feet long by 220 feet wide. Based on its unique beige color, this could be a cloth shelter similar to those often seen on American air bases in the Middle East and elsewhere. Another structure has appeared to the south of the Airborne Laser hangar on the concrete apron that sits adjacent to South Base’s auxiliary runway. This elongated structure measures 200 feet by 60 feet. Finally, a cluster of structures behind the B-2 hangar first appeared late last fall. It is not clear exactly what these are, but they could be a new fuel farm or liquid container system of some type based on their cluster-like arrangement. A set of new administrative buildings is also possible. Official B-21 rendering., USAF The sudden burst of construction on South Base is a very good sign that its new residents will arrive soon—that is if some of them aren’t already tenants. Beyond the B-21 Raider, the aircraft widely referred to as the RQ-180 —a very stealthy high-altitude , long-endurance (HALE) drone with similar capabilities as the RQ-4 Global Hawk , but able to penetrate and persist deep in enemy territory—is also a prime candidate for being moved from Area 51 to Edwards as it transitions into an operational state. It would make sense that the RQ-180 is part of the family of systems being developed to fly over long distances and survive far inside contested airspace alongside the B-21. In fact, it may have acted as a technology demonstrator for the B-21, at least to some degree. There are also plenty of other possible candidates that could be part , or one day become a part, of this clandestine family tree , as well. Also, it is worth noting that the Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) stealthy next-generation cruise missile is already part of the same family of systems and will be in need of testing in the next decade. Regardless, we know for certain the main tenant will be the B-21, and that aircraft is supposedly undergoing assembly now, although The War Zone has long posited the status of the program is actually farther along than the Air Force’s messaging suggests. This could be via flight testing technology demonstrators or test articles to offset major risk, and/or by the B-21 itself being in a more mature state than acknowledged. B-21 Combined Test Force Patch, Ebay Still, we don’t know for certain when the aircraft will descend onto its new home, but its test team is already in place . To achieve an in-service date by the middle of the next decade, one would imagine that it would have to be within the next 24 months or so. These are truly exciting times for Edwards Air Force Base and the flight test community there , as well as the Northrop Grumman team that is tasked with giving birth to the B-21 itself. Few defense programs are as critically important as Raider, especially considering the rise of a robust peer-state threat and the anti-access technologies and strategies potential foes are fielding at an alarming level. The B-21, and the family of systems that will likely support it, will be essential when it comes to reaching out across thousands of miles and kicking down the enemy’s door and putting even its most hardened targets at risk nearly anywhere around the globe. Making all this a reality will start at Edwards South Base in the not too distant future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A week after the crash of a South Dakota Air National Guard F-16C at March Air Reserve Base located near Riverside, California, a new video has surfaced showing the pilot ejecting while on final approach to the base’s runway. The dashcam video, taken from the highway that straddles the base, shows the F-16 descending with its wing dipped to the right before the pilot ejects. The jet then begins a slight climb and appears to slow. This is not uncommon after an ejection as the weight and balance of the aircraft instantly shifts to a nose-light configuration. The second video is the uncropped version of the first. The third video was released shortly after the incident and shows the last moments of F-16’s uncontrolled flight that occurred just after it exited the frame in the first video. In that video, the F-16 is seen flying very slowly in a right bank before crashing through the roof of a warehouse of an aquarium products company. https://youtube.com/watch?v=sQ6tv_14beQ The jet itself is still sitting in the warehouse that it crashed into. Its removal could come any day, but doing so will be tricky. Its live armament was already removed from the area and disposed of by via a controlled detonation. 13 individuals in total, including the pilot of the F-16, were taken to the hospital following the crash. Thankfully, none of the injuries were life-threatening. Another six law enforcement officers were treated for exposure to the aircraft’s debris following the crash. F-16s carry highly volatile and toxic hydrazine as backup generator fuel, not to mention jet fuel and, and in this case, air-to-air weaponry packed with high-explosives. Even parts of the aircraft themselves that have caught fire can be very dangerous to people not wearing protective gear. The exact location where the F-16 crashed through the warehouse roof in relation to the runway and highway., Google Earth As for what happened, that remains unclear. The pilot has not been identified, but a spokesman at March ARB noted he was an experienced F-16 instructor pilot with over 2,000 hours in F-16s. We do know that he reported issues with the F-16’s hydraulic system prior to the crash. One of the 114th Fighter Wing’s Block 40 F-16Cs. , USAF The F-16 was on a local training mission, but the South Dakota Air National Guard jets are stationed at March ARB to sit alert duty for NORAD. They cover the airspace over and around Southern California and are armed for that mission with live weapons—usually a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinders and a pair of AIM-120 AMRAAMs. South Dakota Air National Guard has primarily fulfilled this mission under a fairly unique arrangement since the California Air National Guard 144th Fighter Wing transitioned from the F-16 to the F-15C/D years ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 11, 2019",Russia’s ‘Hunter’ Flying Wing Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle Is A Big Beast,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Satellite imagery has confirmed The War Zone ‘s initial assessment of Russia’s S-70 Okhotnik-B, or Hunter-B, unmanned combat air vehicle is very large, with a wingspan greater than that of an Su-34 Fullback combat jet. The image, which appears to have been from around the date of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent trip to the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center, also shows an array of stores on display next to the drone. Putin visited Chkalov, which is situated in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region, on May 14, 2019, arriving with an escort of six Su-57 advanced combat jets. The satellite image of the flight line at the test center subsequently appeared on social media, showing the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) next to an Su-57 and other aircraft, including an Su-34, a MiG-29 , and multiple Sukhoi Flanker variants. The new imagery does seem to show that the drone has a new paint scheme, which might indicate that it is a more refined design or a second prototype, but official Kremlin statements did confirm that the Russian President got a chance to see the Okhotnik-B. Those other aircraft give a more accurate sense of the Okhotnik-B’s scale. Other images that emerged online in January 2019 had shown a large aircraft tug towing the drone at what appeared to be Sukhoi’s Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association plant, which is in Russia’s Siberian province of the same name. At that time, The War Zone assessed that the UCAV appeared dimensionally similar to Northrop Grumman’s X-47B , which is 38 feet long and has a wingspan of 62 feet. From the satellite imagery, seen at the top of this story and below, it is safe to say that the Okhotnik-B has a wingspan of more than 50 feet and a length of around between 34 and 36 feet. This certainly would put it in the same general size class as the X-47B. via @reutersanders The imagery also gives the first real top-down perspective on the Okhotnik-B, showing that its planform has a more pronounced wing sweep than X-47B. This could give the Russian drone a higher top speed and better efficiency and maneuverability at sustained high speeds. It is also of note that the Okhotnik-B is the only aircraft visible on the flight line with an array of stores next to it. It is unclear whether these stores were actually meant to be associated with the drone or not. While the pictures of the unmanned aircraft that are available at present do not offer a clear view of its underside to determine whether or not it has any sort of internal payload bay or bays, it seems hard to see how it wouldn’t, especially given its overall size. A picture that emerged online in January 2019 showing a large aircraft tug towing the Okhotnik-B prototype., Russian social media If Russia does intend for the final design to have any stealthy characteristics, it will need to carry any weapons internally. However, as The War Zone has noted in its previous analysis of the available imagery of the Okhotnik-B, which you can find here and here , there are serious questions about the UCAV’s stealth features, at least in its initial configuration. The most glaring issue is the crude engine installation, which also does not seem to include any provisions for a stealthier arrangement in the future. The exhausts are a notoriously complex component of any stealth flying wing aircraft. The entire engine arrangement, including both the inlet and exhaust, also appears to be relatively in-line, another feature that would hurt the aircraft’s low observable characteristics. Combined with the high sweep, this engine configuration could add to the Okhotnik-B high-performance characteristics, though. An afterburning engine would similarly give the drone an added boost, potentially pushing it to transonic speeds , or possibly beyond, even if only in a short-duration sprint. With a less stealthy, but higher performance configuration, the Okhotnik-B could offer benefits to the Russian Air Force, including as a “ loyal wingman ” for its Su-57s. There is already evidence that Russia may be exploring manned-unmanned teaming concepts using these two platforms. The potentially high-performance design could make the Okhotnik-B particularly be well suited to the loyal wingman role, since it would help the drone better keep up with manned high-performance fighter jets such as the Su-57. In addition, the Kremlin often has to defer or cancel the development or production of advanced systems in order to free up resources to support other programs . A UCAV, such as Okhotnik-B, might offer an alternate route to expanding its advanced air combat capabilities without needing to buy high-priced manned aircraft. It would also limit the need to recruit and train new aviators. Russia itself is still likely to be in the process of exploring potential concepts of operation for the Okhotnik-B depending on how the drone is or isn’t supposed to evolve throughout its still-ongoing development cycle. Russian officials have said in the past that Okhotnik-B was supposed to fly for the first time this Spring, but there has been no subsequent information about whether this has occurred or if that schedule has gotten pushed back for any reason. The War Zone will certainly keep a close eye out for any new information about the Okhotnik-B. But, if nothing else, we do know that the prototype drone is definitely quite large.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 10, 2018",U.S. Special Operators Will Soon Be Using This 6.5mm “Assault” Machine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. FN America has unveiled a prototype of its new Mk 48 Mod 2 machine gun in the 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge , which it developed in response to a U.S. Special Operations Command requirement. American special operations forces are interested in acquiring an “assault” machine gun in this caliber, which would offer better range than existing weapons that use the smaller 5.56x45mm cartridge , but would still be lighter than more traditional light machine guns. The American subsidiary of Belgian gunmaker FN Herstal revealed the Mk 48 Mod 2 for the first time at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC), which began on May 20, 2019. The machine gun is also available chambered for the 7.62x51mm cartridge, just like the previous Mod 0 and Mod 1 variants. FN debuted the 7.62x51mm Mod 2 version last year, which includes a number of other upgrades over the earlier models, including an improved buttstock with an adjustable cheek rest, a new handguard and bipod assembly, revised charging handle, and a number of internal refinements. “Once development is complete, existing Mk 48 Mod 1 models can be configured at the armorer level to the Mod 2 variant or newest [6.5mm Creedmoor] caliber with the addition of the upgrade kit and barrel conversion,” according to an official press release. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), through the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division in Crane Indiana, also known simply as NSWC Crane, has been looking into a 6.5mm machine gun since at least 2016. At that time, a number of different specific cartridges were under consideration, including 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, and .264 USA, the latter being a round that the U.S. Army developed internally for its Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU). A US Army soldier fires an existing 7.62x51mm Mk 48 Mod 1 machine gun., US Army The ostensible goal of the smaller assault machine gun program is to give special operators an improved means of hitting targets that are out of range of 5.56x45mm weapons, such as the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and its special operations specific variants, but without the weight and bulk of a 7.62x51mm light machine gun. NSWC Crane is also leading the development of a larger .338 caliber machine gun , which would fill a similar intermediate role, but between 7.62x51mm weapons and the venerable .50 caliber M2 “Ma Deuce.” There had also been talk in the past about the possibility of a belt-fed weapon optimized for very close range using a specialized cartridge, such as the .300 Blackout cartridge, a round you can read about in more detail here . At the time of writing, NSWC Crane had not yet responded to our queries for information about the status of that development. A 2016 NSWC Cranebriefing slide mentioning a short-range belt-fed weapon potentially chambered in .300 Blackout., USN Choosing the Mk 48 series as a starting place for the 6.5mm assault machine gun makes good sense. The original Mk 48 Mod 0, which special operations forces first began using in 2003, was already supposed to offer a lighter weight 7.62x51mm weapon to fill the same general operational need. Regular U.S. military units also subsequently began using the Mk 48s, which are around 10 pounds lighter than the U.S. Army’s standard M240B infantry light machine gun. That service even developed a backpack-mounted ammunition system for the weapon, akin to ones seen in Hollywood action flicks, such as Predator , for dismounted patrols, which also made its way into special operations use. A US Navy SEAL carries a Mk 48 Mod 1 with a “Predator-style” backpack-mounted ammunition system., DOD Unfortunately, the original guns were so light that they would suffer a loss of accuracy during sustained firing due to the severe recoil. There were also overheating and reliability problems, all of which prompted the development of the improved Mk 48 Mod 1 variant. It is probable that the smaller 6.5mm cartridge may further help mitigate any remaining issues. The 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge also actually offers better range than the larger 7.62x51mm. As a result, SOCOM is separately in the process of developing a designated marksman rifle using this round, which will give operators improved capabilities over existing weapons of that type without having to employ a true sniper rifle. A briefing slide describing the benefits that a 6.5mm Creedmoor or .260 Remington designated marksman rifle would offer over existing 7.62x51mm guns., SOCOM via Soldier Systems Daily Having a new designated marksman rifle and an assault machine gun that use the same cartridge could be very valuable, especially for special operators during long-duration missions or in emergency situations where they might need to share ammunition in a pinch. There could be interest in a 6.5mm Creedmoor battle rifle in the future, or a conversion kit for the existing 7.62x51mm Mk 17 Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle-Heavy (SCAR-H), but there are no such plans at present. Since FN’s gun is simply another variant in the Mk 48 line, SOCOM will have the option of simply rechambering its inventory of those guns to fire the 6.5mm round, rather than buying new weapons. This could also help ease logistical strains depending on how much of the 6.5mm version has in common with other Mod 2s or earlier variants. Using the Mk 48 as a starting place will also ease training requirements, since the gun has many of the same basic controls and features as earlier versions. All of this will help make the Mk 48 Mod 2 a particularly cost-effective development. As of 2018, SOCOM expected the development of the weapon to wrap up some time this year. The goal is for special operators to begin receiving their new 6.5mm assault machine guns by the end of 2019. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2019",Turkey Says It Now Plans On Manufacturing Russia’s S-500 Air Defense System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Turkish President Recep Erdogan says his country will cooperate on the production of Russia’s S-500 surface-to-air missile system, a move that is sure to draw new criticism from the United States and its other fellow NATO members. Turkey is already increasingly at risk of getting kicked out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over its planned purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems. The S-500 announcement also follows Russia’s offer to sell Turkey Su-57 advanced fighter jets if its F-35 deal collapses, yet another example of how the Kremlin has been steadily working to pull Ankara into its orbit in recent years. Erdogan revealed the plans to work with Russia on producing the S-500 during a televised question and answer session with university students in the city of Istanbul on May 18, 2019 . The Turkish President had suggested there was a possibility of Turkey supporting the S-500 program in March 2019 . He did not clarify in either case whether this meant that Turkey will also be buying this air defense system itself, but it is hard to see why the country would decide to locally produce components of an advanced weapon system that it doesn’t plan to buy for its own use. “There will be a joint production of the S-500, as well as the S-400,” Erdogan said . “There is absolutely no question of taking a step back from the S-400s purchase. That is a done deal.” The various components of the S-500 air defense system., Almaz-Antey via Army Recognition Turkey incensed the United States and other NATO members when it announced its intention to buy the S-400 in 2017. The U.S. government, among others, says there are unacceptable operational security risks from the Turkish military operating the Russian air defense system and the F-35, a set of issues that you can read about in more detail here and here. On Mar. 1, 2019, the Pentagon put “deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability” on hold until Turkey abandons the S-400 purchase. Members of Congress are also now looking for ways to permanently block the Turkish government from receiving the jets and cut the country off from its not insubstantial industrial cooperation on the Joint Strike Fighter program. Erdogan and his government have remained defiant and the Turkish President has also said that the F-35 program cannot exist without Turkish cooperation, something American officials dispute. “Sooner or later, we will receive the F-35s, we will receive its parts, and S-400s will come to our country, god willing,” he told the assembled students in Istanbul on May 18, 2019 . But Turkey’s continued membership in the F-35 program was already looking uncertain, at best, before the S-500 announcement. This is almost certain to drive further calls in Congress to expel the Turkish government from the Joint Strike Fighter effort. Russia has already sought to take advantage of this upheaval, with Sergey Chemezov, head of Russia’s central state-run industrial conglomerate Rostec, publicly offering the Su-57 as a potential alternative during an interview with Turkish state media earlier in May . “We will welcome the Turkish side’s wish to become a partner in the S-500 project,” Chemezov had added . Erdogan did not say what requirement the S-500, which Russia has been developing since 2009 and has described as having an important ballistic missile defense role, might fill for the Turkish armed forces. Turkey does say that it needs to buy the S-400s in part due to the regional threat of ballistic missiles from countries such as Syria . NATO members, including the United States, have deployed Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to Turkey on multiple occasions in the past to provide that country with a theater ballistic missile defense shield. Russia has also described S-500, which reportedly hit a target 300 miles away in 2018, a world record for any surface-to-air missile system if confirmed, as a compliment to the S-400, rather than a replacement for that system. The road-mobile system, which the Kremlin expects to enter service next year , also offers a more flexible and survivable alternative to fixed silo-based anti-ballistic missiles systems, such as the A-135 , in certain circumstances. With its very long range, the S-500 is also set to expand Russia’s anti-access and area-denial umbrellas, especially in certain areas of Europe, such as the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea regions. For Turkey, it could certainly help massively expand the scope and capabilities of the country’s aging air defense network, which presently relies heavily on Cold War-era American MIM-23 HAWK and British Rapier systems . However, the industrial cooperation component of the Russian deals may be more important to Turkey. Ankara has repeatedly rejected counter-offers from the United States to buy versions of the Patriot surface-to-air missile system, reportedly over cost and reticence on the part of the manufacturer Raytheon to allow for local production of any significant portions of the system. In 2013 , the Turkish government had also selected the Chinese FD-2000 surface-to-air missile system to provide its armed forces with an organic long-range air and ballistic missile defense capability, before abandoning that plan two years later in the face of significant pressure from the United States. Industrial offsets for Turkey with regards to the S-500, as well as the S-400 and any other potential future cooperative efforts with Russia, could also help mitigate the losses Turkish defense contractors would suffer if the country gets ejected from the F-35 program. A German Patriot missile launcher in position in Turkey in 2014., Bernd von Jutrczenka/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images But since 2016, U.S.-Turkish relations have also become increasingly strained since a failed coup attempt to oust Erdogan, in general. Though there is no evidence to support these claims, the Turkish President has at times advanced conspiracy theories that the U.S. military was involved. Turkey has also been fighting to secure the extradition of Fethullah Gülen over the abortive coup. Gülen is a former political ally of Erdogan who now lives in self-imposed exile in the United States. Turkey has also arrested and imprisoned more than one American national over alleged links to the coup, as well. Turkish and U.S. government authorities have also repeatedly sparred over a number of other issues, including U.S. support to Kurdish factions in Syria that Ankara has declared to be terrorists and Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian policies . It is unclear if Erdogan believes that announcing a potential S-500 deal could force the U.S. government to acquiesce to any number of demands, but, regardless, this seems unlikely to occur given bipartisan opposition in Congress to the existing S-400 purchase. The S-400 order itself could also prompt sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act ( CAATSA ). The United States can issue waivers, but again, it seems unlikely that it would do so after so heavily criticizing the purchase, to begin with. With all this in mind, a potential order for the new air defense systems seems almost certain to have the exact opposite effect and could potentially prompt additional calls from American legislators to cut Turkey off from participation in a host of other U.S.-led weapon systems programs and end lucrative deals that allow U.S. forces to operate from various Turkish bases . It already seems increasingly untenable for the United States to continue storing nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. There have been concerns that S-400 deal might even cause an irrevocable rift between Turkey and NATO, though the alliance continues to stress Ankara’s contributions and advocate for a diplomatic solution to its present impasses with the United States. Erdogan may want to insist that everything will work out in the end, but his opponents in the United States are increasingly making it clear that Turkey’s purchases of advanced Russian weapon systems are incompatible with American interests. If members of Congress were willing to look for ways to close the door on Turkish participation on the F-35 over the S-400 order, it’s hard to see how those efforts won’t redouble in the face of this new S-500 deal.

Trump’s fiery Tweet came in response to a lone rocket that struck the Green Zone in Iraq’s capital Baghdad on May 19, 2019 . It also followed the U.S. Navy’s revelation that the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge , had moved out of the Persian Gulf and into the Arabian Sea to conduct a variety of exercises with the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its associated carrier strike group. Information about the actual intelligence that spurred this latest spike in U.S.-Iran tensions – which prompted the deployment of various American naval, air, and ground forces – remains limited and what details are available continue to be the subject of intense debate within the U.S. government and between it and many of its major allies. The rocket that flew into the sprawling Green Zone hit near Iraq’s Monument of the Unknown Soldier, which is situated around a third of a mile from the perimeter of the U.S. Embassy compound and approximately a mile from the Embassy itself. Iraqi officials said the weapon caused no significant damage and that there were no casualties. No group has officially claimed responsibility for the incident, but Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasoul told reporters that initial evidence suggested the rocket had come from East Baghdad , which is home to known Iranian-supported Shi’ite militias. For two weeks now, U.S.-Iran tensions have been at a recent high after the U.S. government deployed B-52 bombers to the Middle East and expedited the arrival of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its associated carrier strike group in the Persian Gulf following supposed intelligence that Iranian forces and their proxies were moving into position to potentially launch attacks on U.S. interests in the region. Other additional naval, air, and ground forces have since arrived, as well. “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran,” Trump wrote in his Tweet. “Never threaten the United States again!” On May 20, 2019, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif took to Twitter to issue a rebuttal. “Goaded by #B_Team, @realdonaldTrump hopes to achieve what Alexander [the Great], Genghis [Khan] & other aggressors failed to do,” he wrote, making a reference to hawkish National Security Advisor John Bolton , who has been at the forefront of the recent accusations against Iran. “Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone. #EconomicTerrorism & genocidal taunts won’t ‘end Iran’.” Zarif continued, referring to growing U.S. sanctions against the Iranian government. “#NeverThreatenAnIranian. Try respect—it works!” Despite Zarif’s general attitude of defiance, there have also been unconfirmed reports that Iran may be repositioning various surface-to-air missile systems to be better placed to respond to potential American strikes. Video footage appeared on social media on May 20, 2019, showing components of Iran’s long-range, Russian-made S-300PMU-2 surface-to-air missile systems on the move. These clips are undated, but there are reports that the movements they show preceded Trump’s new threat. Before the rocket attack in Iraq on May 19, 2019, the U.S. Navy had also announced that the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and the USS Kearsarge had been training together in the Middle East. “The exercises and training we are doing with Amphibious Squadron Six, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit and USS Kearsarge are aimed towards increasing our lethality and agility to respond to threats, and deterring destabilizing actions in this important region,” U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Wade, the commander of Carrier Strike Group 12, said in a statement . This was a significant show of force, but it notably occurred in the Arabian Sea, rather than in the Persian Gulf. This allows the ships to have nearly the same presence in the region and maintain close proximity to the contentious Strait of Hormuz, but without the risk of getting trapped in the Persian Gulf during an actual crisis. Iran has repeatedly threatened to blockade this strategic chokepoint over the years, which it could seek to do with a mix ballistic missiles , anti-ship cruise missiles , naval mines , swarming boat attacks , unmanned aerial vehicles . Both Iran and the United States continue to insist publicly that they are not seeking war with each other. But there is are still concerns about the increasing risks of miscalculations and misinterpretations of certain military movements and other activities. It remains unclear whether or not the rocket strike on the Green Zone itself was actually part of any larger coordinated effort on the part of Iran or its proxies, or is just business as usual. The heavily fortified area within Baghdad was subjected to repeated rocket and other attacks throughout the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, which officially ended in 2011, but has been the target of sporadic indirect weapons fire since then, as well. Most recently, three mortar bombs rocked the Green Zone in September 2018 and the U.S. government also blamed that attack, which also caused no casualties, on Iranian-backed militias. Still, in December 2018 , Iraqi authorities judged that the security situation had improved to the point where the Green Zone could become open to the public again for the first time in 15 years. The potential for increased attacks on the Green Zone from Iranian-linked Iraq militias was reportedly the reason why U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed to Iraq on May 7, 2019, according to Reuters , citing unnamed Iraqi officials. Just over a week later, the State Department ordered all non-essential personnel to leave the country, citing the increased threat from Iran and its proxies. “We take this incident very seriously,” a State Department official told Reuters . “We will hold Iran responsible if any such attacks are conducted by its proxy militia forces or elements of such forces, and will respond to Iran accordingly.” But a single rocket landing in the Green Zone almost a week later does not seem to match U.S. government claims that the threats were both “ imminent ” and aimed at causing “ mass casualties .” As time goes on, without any major surge in attacks on American interests, or those of its allies, the assertion that there is an immediate increased risk of Iranian or Iranian-supported attacks can only become more questionable. As always, this is not to say that Iran hasn’t targeted U.S. military personnel or other American nationals over the years or that it doesn’t present real threats to American allies in the Middle East. But there continues to be an equally real debate over whether the recent intelligence the U.S. government received two weeks ago indicates an actual increased threat warranting responses that could provoke a serious conflict with Iran, intentionally or not. There remains only limited information about the scope and nature of the purported threats. These reportedly included Iranian personnel loading unspecified missiles onto smaller fishing boats, known locally as dhows , though it remains unclear whether or not this indicated preparations for attacks using the cover of nominally civilian vessels or was part of some other activity. Iran has been actively engaged in the smuggling of such weapons to its proxies, particularly Houthi rebels in Yemen. The U.S. intelligence community has reportedly declassified an image of one of these boats, but has not yet released it to the public for unknown reasons. The U.S. government has also blamed Iran or Iranian-backed groups for a still-murky attack on four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on May 13, 2019, but has yet to release evidence or any other information on how it arrived at this conclusion. On May 17, 2019 , Reuters reported that the Norwegian Shipowners’ Mutual War Risks Insurance Association, also known by its Norwegian acronym DNK, had also determined that it was “highly likely” that Iran or its Houthi allies had been responsible for these attacks, which involved a mothership off-shore launching underwater drones. One of the damaged ships was the Norwegian-flagged M/V Andrea Victory , which is see in the video below with a hole in her rear hull. DNK’s conclusion was based on apparent similarities between the attacks on previous Houthi attacks using unmanned, explosive-laden boats. However, the insurance company also said that the attacks off of the UAE were the result of underwater drones, rather than ones sailing on the surface. There have also been previous reports that actual swimmers might have placed limpet mines on the ships’ hulls. To date, no one has claimed responsibility for these attacks. However, it is important to note that the UAE, as well as Saudi Arabia, whose tankers both suffered damage during the attack, are engaged in an active conflict with the Houthis and have previously warned about the rebels seeking to threaten commercial shipping elsewhere in the Middle East. The Yemeni militants have recently stepped up attacks on Saudi Arabia, including reported drones strikes on that country’s oil infrastructure and ballistic missile strikes on Saudi cities. But the Houthis have conducted similar operations in the past and it is hard to say conclusively that any of these incidents were part of a new, coordinated effort on the part of the Iranian government or merely coincided with the uptick in tensions between the United States and Iran. A briefing slide regarding Houthi unmanned explosive-laden boats that the United States previously presented. The map shows reported locations of one of these drone boats that Saudi Arabia captured in 2016, showing it was present, at least for a time at various Iranian controlled islands in the Strait of Hormuz, just north of where the attack on the tankers occurred in May 2019., DOD “The kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want war in the region and does not strive for that,” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al Jubeir said on May 19, 2019 . “But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will fight this with all force and determination and it will defend itself, its citizens and its interests.” Unfortunately, at a certain point, the present U.S.-Iran tensions may take on a life of their own, if they haven’t already, regardless of the immediacy of the supposed threats that prompted the situation in the first place. For instance, many of the United States’ European allies have called the initial intelligence into question and have said that they themselves have no indication of increased threats from Iran in the region. However, the Dutch and the Germans have temporarily halted military training activities in Iraq, out of apparent concerns of getting caught up in a potential conflict between the United States and Iran. Spain similarly withdrew a frigate that had been sailing with the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, ostensibly due to having not agreed to the change in the carrier’s deployment plan and schedule, but reportedly due to similar fears of getting swept up in the increasing tensions. Perhaps most notably, the United Kingdom has increased its force protection posture across the Middle East last week in response to the developing situation, but did so shortly after British Army Major General Christopher Ghika, presently the second in command of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria fighting ISIS, said he was unaware of any increased risks form Iranian or Iranian-backed forces. Members of Congress continue to debate the actual significance of the available intelligence and the Trump Administration is reportedly planning additional briefings for legislators who remain skeptical of the claims of newly imminent threats from Iran. Last week, a number of lawmakers accused the White House of deliberately keeping them in the dark about the exact nature of the situation in the Middle East. There have been bipartisan calls for greater clarity on reported threats, though some of the Republicans who have asked for more information, notably South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, say they now believe the Trump Administration’s framing of the situation to be accurate . Publicly available details on the original potential threats to American interests in the Middle East from Iran and its proxies, as well as the current risk assessment, remain scant. In the coming days, the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group could push through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf, which would be a real test of the stability of the situation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 17, 2017",Has Israel Actually Sent The F-35 Into Combat Already?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For some time now, various news outlets have claimed that Israel is already using its pair of recently-delivered F-35I Adirs in a combat role even before they’ve been declared operational by the Israeli Air Force. But today, military aviation journalist Thomas Newdick conveyed a report by a French journalist that not only claimed the F-35Is have been active over Syria, but also details what targets they specifically took out on their mission there. Additionally, the writer claims the Adir’s first combat missions occurred in January, just a month after the aircraft arrived on Israeli soil. Thomas Newdick skeptically summarizes the report on Air Forces Monthly’s news blog : Georges Malbrunot, who writes for French newspaper Le Figaro , cited French intelligence sources. He posted on Twitter today that examples of the Israeli F-35—two of which have been delivered to the country to date—took part in a raid over Syrian territory on the night of January 12-13. The mission saw them strike objectives around the capital, Damascus. According to Malbrunot, the F-35s targeted warehouses containing Russian-made Pantsir-S1 mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems that Israel feared could be delivered from Syria to Hezbollah forces operating in Lebanon. The warehouse was located at Mezzeh, a military airfield in Damascus. During the same attack, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) also reportedly destroyed an S-300 SAM battery deployed near the Syrian presidential palace, on Mount Qassioun. According to the same unnamed French intelligence source quoted by Malbrunot, the F-35 aircraft finally overflew the palace of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad before returning to Israel. Malbrunot provided a final quote from an unnamed soldier, explaining that “With the Pantsir, Hezbollah ensures that the Israeli Air Force is almost totally unable to operate over Lebanon.” The IAF has had bouts of activity over Syria in recent months, hitting targets usually related to Hezbollah . For years, IAF fighter aircraft have operated over Syria without issues, relying on the IAF’s advanced electronic warfare and hacking capabilities to give their tactical aircraft a cloak against Syria’s somewhat antiquated air defense system. In 2015, Netanyahu and Putin initially worked out a deal to deconflict Israel air operations over Syria with Russian aircraft and air defenses shortly after Russia started its military adventure in Syria. In recent months that deal has begun to deteriorate . But still, Syria does not have any S-300 batteries as the report claims—the only “triple digit” SAM systems deployed to Syria are owned and operated by Russia. In particular, these include an S-400 battery at Russia’s air base south of Latakia and a S-300 battery deployed near Russia’s expanded warm-water naval facility in Tartus, Syria. With this in mind, unless Israel has taken upon itself to destroy Russian SAM systems and Russia had no issue with it, this claimed attack did not happen. As for flying over Assad’s palace in some show of force, the likelihood that actually happened is slim to none. Why would Israel provoke an already very fragile situation in Syria and especially risk their most prized weapon system—including the international fallout that would go along with it—for what amounts to a hollywood-like intimidation gag? Coincidentally, I also find it funny how Israeli seems to always buzz their potential enemies’ palaces in media reports. In the past, when Israel was proving its air dominance in the region, such a tactic may have been used sparingly for psychological warfare purposes, but it serves little purpose today on battlefield Syria. Sure, it sounds cool—like something ripped from an ’80s action movie or bar room tale—but in reality, it only invites additional risk and the IAF has nothing to prove to their neighbors. As for the Pantsir-S1 being transferred to Hezbollah—there is already a talk about Iran obtaining these advanced point air defense systems through Syria, with Damascus working as an intermediary. And yes, any advanced arms transfer to Hezbollah seems to be a highly legitimate and high-value target in Israel’s eyes. But the claim that IAF would be unable to operate over Lebanon if a handful of these systems fell into Hezbollah’s hands shows a poor understanding of modern air combat capabilities, especially those of the IAF, and of the Pantsir-S1 system. In addition, active Pantsir point defense systems become targets themselves, especially considering Israel’s high-end electronic surveillance abilities and unique asymmetric suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) capabilities. In other words, although it increases risks to air operations, the IAF can deal with a few Pantsir-S1s in the hands of Hezbollah. At this point, the story doesn’t hold much credibility, but what about the F-35I being used in this, or any other operations over Syria? It is highly unlikely, although considering the increasingly inhospitable air defense environment being constructed by Russia over Syria and much of the surrounding region, eventually using the F-35I for extremely high-priority missions over the war-torn country may become a necessity. Has that time already come? Unlikely, especially since Israeli standoff munitions could achieve the same effects without risking any sensitive technology or the stability of Israel’s most important weapons program. Israel is known for its amazing aerospace ingenuity and for rushing its newest fighters into service to take part in specific missions or conflicts, but putting the F-35 into a combat environment within a month of receiving the aircraft, and nearly a year before the IAF says the jet may be operational, is a big stretch. And once again, the geopolitical ramifications of something going wrong while doing so, potentially putting the whole program at risk internationally, outstrips the need to use the aircraft to blow up some point defense systems in a warehouse that can be struck via other far less sensitive means. Is it possible that the F-35I may have ventured outside Israeli borders to test its ability to detect, geolocate and classify Russia’s most advanced air defense systems from afar? And could this have occurred while Israel’s F-15 and F-16 fighters were on a real mission inside enemy territory? Maybe, but Israel has plenty of other assets that are capable of collecting similar data and this would be a far cry from the F-35I’s supposed actions detailed by the French reporter. The funny thing is that I’ve heard reports from Israeli and other intentional news sources that have claimed F-35Is struck targets in Syria before any F-35s were even delivered to the IAF. Sure, the targets were struck, but not by a jet that hadn’t even arrived in the region yet. The reality is that the F-35A will have its day—many days actually—on the leading edges of battlefield middle east soon enough, but let’s keep things in perspective until then. In the end, it may be possible that Israel has used their two F-35Is in some combat or combat support role, but it is far from probable, and so far there is little evidence that supports such a claim.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 16, 2019",The U.S. Military Wants Tiny Road Mobile Nuclear Reactors That Can Fit In A C-17,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s secretive Strategic Capabilities Office , or SCO, is asking for potential vendors to submit proposals for small mobile nuclear reactors to help meet ever-growing demands for power during operations in remote and austere locations. This request for information comes as the U.S. Army, in particular, is looking to extend the amount of time its units can operate independent of established supply chains, but portable nuclear power could introduce new risks to the battlefield. SCO first announced that they were looking for “information on innovative technologies and approaches” relating to a possible future “small mobile nuclear reactor prototype design” on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on Jan. 18, 2019 . The organization posted an amended version of the notice, which outlines a “multi-phase prototype project” as part of what it is calling Project Dilithium, four days later. “Energy usage during contingency operations will likely increase significantly over the next few decades,” the latest version of the request for information explains. “The modern operational space has amplified the need for alternative energy sources to enable mobility in forward land based and maritime military operations .” SCO basic requirements envision a reactor that can generate between one and 10 megawatts of energy, less than the average output for even a small research reactor , and weigh less than 40 tons. The final design would need to be portable by semi-trailer truck, ship, or a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III cargo plane. A diagram from a previous US military report depicting a potential concept of operations for deploying a mobile nuclear reactor., DOD The goal is to develop a system that personnel can set up in three days or less and shut down and pack up in less than a week. The reactor itself would remain functional for at least three years without needing new fuel. SCO is hoping to consider up to three designs under the first phase of the project, which would be an in-depth design study that would last between nine and 12 months. The plan is to then down select to a single design for Phase II, in which the winning contractor would build and demonstrate their prototype reactor. There are a number of potential concepts already in various stages of development that could meet SCO’s requirements. The U.S. Department of Energy’s own Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in cooperation with the Westinghouse power company, has been working on one design called MegaPower for some time now. Westinghouse is separately working on its own eVinci micro reactor design. The MegaPower reactor can generate at least one megawatt of power for up to 10 years and meets the SCO’s demands for how long it takes to set up and tear down. More importantly, the design uses what are known as “heat pipes” to both keep the system cool and generate power, eliminating the need for complex and potentially hazardous water-cooling arrangements. The video below describes how this arrangement works in more detail. Another option in development is Filippone and Associates LLC’s Holos , a unique gas-cooled modular reactor. Named after the Greek word meaning “whole,” the design only “goes critical” and works as intended when a certain number of modules are positioned together, touching off the nuclear reaction. Each self-contained modular has its own turbine generator that then produces power. A standard four-module arrangement is small enough to fit inside a standard ISO shipping container. Depending on the exact configuration, Filippone and Associates says Holos can generate between three and 13 megawatts and has an operational life of up to 60 years. You can learn more about this design in the video below. There are other small nuclear reactors either available or in development, such as the URENCO U-Battery and StarCore ’s micro reactor, but these are not necessarily intended to be rapidly repositioned from one place to another. They could require significant modifications to meet the portability requirements that SCO is looking for. There is no fixed timeline yet for when Phase I might begin, but as the request for information notes, there is already significant demand for this kind of miniaturized portable power plant. Electrical power demands are only likely to increase in the near future as the U.S. military continues to expand its use of communications and networking capabilities , mobile sensor and electronic warfare systems, and more. Living spaces, mess halls, and other more general facilities all need electricity, too. Electric or hybrid electric vehicles and electrically-powered weapons, such as railguns and directed energy weapons , will only add to these power generation requirements. At present, deployed U.S. military forces rely almost entirely on established power grids and their own fossil-fuel powered generators to generate the required power to keep bases and forward operating sites up and running. Especially at remote and austere locations, this requires a steady supply of diesel or other fuels either by ground convoy or aircraft . This can quickly become a costly proposition and demands additional resources to safeguard those supply lines. Any disruption can severely degrade deployed units’ combat effectiveness and put them at risk of losing communications and situational awareness if the power goes out or has to be rationed. You can read more about these issues in detail here . These are the kind of concerns that led the U.S. Army to announce in November 2018 that it was looking for ways to ensure its brigade combat teams would be able to fight for a week without getting resupplied. This is twice as long as those units can operate without fuel and other supplies at present. The Army is certainly watching the SCO’s Project Dilithium, if it isn’t involved in it directly. In October 2018, the service put out its own report on the potential uses of nuclear power on the battlefield. “This study finds that as a technical matter, nuclear power can reduce supply vulnerabilities and operating costs while providing a sustainable option for reducing petroleum demand,” that report concluded. “Energy is a cross-cutting enabler of military power and nuclear fuel provides the densest form of energy able to generate the electrical power necessary at forward and remote locations without the need for continuous fuel resupply.” The other branches of the U.S. military have their own requirements for this kind of portable power, as well. The Air Force and the Marine Corps are both actively exploring new concepts for rapidly establishing bases that could benefit from the addition of power from small nuclear reactors. But this is hardly the first time the U.S. military has explored using mobile nuclear reactors to meet its power needs. The Army experimented with a host of land-based designs between the 1950s and 1970s, before shelving the concept. The service was responsible for building the world’s first-ever land-transportable, mobile nuclear power plant, the ML-1 . A US Army truck tows the ML-1 reactor during a test., US Army The SCO’s Project Dilithium itself looks to be the latest evolution of a more recent effort that has been going on for more than a decade now. That led to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) receiving funding to explore “ Small Rugged Reactor Technologies ” in the defense budget for the 2012 Fiscal Year and the development of LANL’s MegaPower design. In 2016, the Defense Science Board further promoted the development of mobile nuclear power in another report about power options for forward and remote bases. However, one of the biggest potential problems with battlefield nuclear power continues to be safety. There are obvious concerns about what happens when you begin deploying dozens, if not hundreds of small nuclear reactors into areas that are, by definition, full of hostile threats. The SCO’s requirements demand a design that is incapable of melting down, does not require constant monitoring for otherwise safe operation, and doesn’t present an immediate health hazard. LANL and Filippone and Associates LLC both claim that their designs meet these requirements through inherent safety features in their respective designs. But even if the reactor itself cannot catastrophically fail, something that may be a tall order to ensure in austere conditions regardless of the design, powering remote and austere bases with nuclear power could run other risks. If hostile forces end up destroying the reactor, it could potentially lead to the hazardous dispersal of radioactive material . Members of Alaska Army National Guard’s 103rd Civil Support Team conduct a mock radiological reconnaissance mission during an exercise in 2018., US Army This, in turn, could produce short- and long-term health and safety concerns for U.S. forces and innocent civilians in the surrounding area. Even if the risk is minor, the perception of those dangers could impact public opinion about American military activities and give an opponent ample opportunity to spread harmful misinformation and disinformation . A good example of how this might play out is the mix of reasonable public concerns and Russian propaganda over U.S. military-sponsored disease prevention and biological warfare defense programs. There’s also a proliferation issue in building a large number of mobile reactors and placing them in war zones. There is also a matter of disposing of the nuclear waste material they’ll produce. The U.S. government, as well as its allies and partners around the world, expend considerable effort ensuring that radioactive material of any kind is safeguarded. A reactor that is by design mobile would almost certainly be an attractive target for terrorists or militants looking to build a so-called “ dirty bomb ” that mixes radiological material and conventional explosives. Experts continue to debate the actual threat that these devices actually pose, but there seems to be little doubt that they could be particularly capable of creating widespread panic . Radioisotope thermoelectric generators on board a US Air Force C-17 in preparation for their movement to the Nevada National Security Site for disposal in 2015., USAF On top of that, unlike existing portable generators, any mobile nuclear reactor would require much more robust control systems to ensure its safe and reliable operation. Depending on the reactor’s exact configuration, there is the possibility that a cyber attack might be able to shut it down or otherwise hamper its operation at a critical point. In October 2018 , the Government Accountability Office released a report that slammed the Department of Defense’s existing protections against cyber attacks and said that the U.S. military did not have a good grasp of the extent of the potential threat. Nuclear reactors spread across an area of operations would only increase the potential vectors for such an attack. “The Task Force sees the need and benefit outweighing the difficulty in achieving nearly limitless energy on the battlefield,” the Defense Science Board concluded in 2016. “The Task Force did not find the technology to be unachievable nor are the deployment issues impossible; the U.S. military has overcome comparable challenges before.” Other alternatives may become more practical as time goes on, as well. including miniaturized fusion reactors and hydrogen fuel cell technology . It seems likely that the U.S. military will eventually pursue a mix of different power generation options rather than any one single technology. Still, the increasing demand for battlefield power is certainly a very real issue and portable nuclear reactors could provide a solution, or at least part of a solution, to that problem. It now looks to be up to SCO’s Project Dilithium to determine whether or not the available technology has finally reached a point where it is actually safe and practical for widespread military use.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The much anticipated “ghost” scheme F-16C belonging to the 64th Aggressor Squadron based at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas has emerged from the paint barn. The paint job came to be via a crowdsourced competition on 57th Wing Commander Brigadier General Robert Novotny’s Facebook page, with followers submitting different design ideas and voting on each one in a number of rounds, ending with this scheme being chosen. You can read all about how this competition came to be, the value of ornate aggressor paint jobs, and so much more in our interview with General Novotny. Novotny posted a video on Facebook of the jet being painted and the final result of everyone’s engagement. If it doesn’t pop up below automatically, you can find it here . The striking motif is similar to ones worn by some of Russia’s small, but supposedly set to grow fleet of Su-57 next-generation fighters . Su-57 wearing a similar digitized ‘ghost’ scheme. , UAC The new paint job appears to have four separate contrasting tones. The top features a digitized aqua colored pattern with a baby blue base, while the bottom is off-white with what appears to be a darker blue pattern overlaid. Of all the creative USAF aggressor paint jobs flying, it certainly seems to be one of the showiest. 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page As a side note, it appears that the Navy actually beat the USAF to the punch when it comes to fielding the first ghost-like scheme on a U.S. aggressor jet. Photos popped up earlier in the week showing a legacy F/A-18 Hornet belonging to VFC-12 sporting a very similar motif. Did the Navy actively attempt preempt the USAF’s high-profile reveal? That isn’t clear at this time, but other schemes have first appeared on VFC-12 jets just to show up on 64th AGRS jets not long after . Then again, these schemes are largely driven by enemy threats that exist in the real world, so coincidences are bound to happen. Regardless of the possibility of a little good-natured competition between the services when it comes adversary paint jobs, it will be interesting to see the ‘ghost’ F-16 in the air with its new bad guy duds. If the scheme is well received, we will probably see it on other 64th AGRS jets, and who knows, maybe even aggressor F-35s , in the not too distant future. 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook page Above all else, the new aggressor paint design stands a testament to how military commanders can have a meaningful, creative, and fun interaction with civilians on social media that actually results in something tangible that people can appreciate being part of.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military’s biannual Northern Edge exercise is in full swing in Alaska and a picture has emerged showing an F-15C Eagle taking part in the drills while carrying a Lockheed Martin Legion Pod . This system has an infrared search and track sensor, or IRST, which offers the pilot an important additional way to detect and track other aircraft at significant ranges. The Air Force doesn’t expect this system to reach initial operational capability until next year, but it’s no surprise it has appeared at this exercise, which has long served as a valuable opportunity to test new advanced aircraft and systems and the fighting doctrine associated with them. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), which manages the exercise, posted the picture of the F-15C, which carries the “WA” tail code of Nellis Air Force Base, on May 15, 2019. The caption does not say what specific unit the plane belongs to or mention the Legion Pod . The base is home to the 57th Wing, which, among other things, manages the prestigious U.S. Air Force Weapons School . Nellis is also responsible for managing the adjacent and sprawling Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) and the base hosts a wide variety of test and evaluation units. This iteration of Northern Edge is a particularly large event, involving approximately 10,000 personnel and some 250 aircraft from across the services. “The exercise is designed to sharpen participants’ tactical combat skills, to improve command, control and communication relationships, and to develop interoperable plans and programs across the joint force,” according to an official statement . F-15Cs are regular participants in the biannual exercise and the aircraft with the Legion Pod is only one of a number of Eagles taking part in the drill. An F-15C Eagle from Nellis Air Force Base flies over Alaska while carrying a Legion Pod during Northern Edge 2019., USAF The Air Force’s fleet of around 220 F-15C/D Eagles remains a critical part of the service’s air-superiority capabilities, both at home and abroad, after decades of service. There had been talk in recent years about retiring the jets for good and there is now a push to replace these aircraft with new production F-15Xs, which you can read about in more detail here and here . In the meantime, the Air Force is continuing on its “Golden Eagle” upgrade path to give the F-15C/Ds important capabilities to ensure they remain relevant in the coming years. This has included efforts to add powerful AN/APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array radars, conformal fuel tanks , and new cockpit displays , as well as integrating Lockheed Martin’s AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) on the jets. The latter system offers a long-range identification capability, day or night, as well as a secondary intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance functionality. It primarily finds its targets by slaving the optics to the F-15C’s radar. The pilot can also manually steer the Sniper ATP’s camera or can cue it to their Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ). It also offers something of tertiary “poor man’s” IRST-like capability, but nothing near as capable as a dedicated IRST system, such as the IRST21 in the Legion Pod. A pair of F-15Cs from the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom equipped with Sniper ATPs after recently arriving in the Middle East., USAF The AN/ASG-34 IRST-equipped Legion Pod offers far more robust and automated functionality and can quickly spot and track multiple targets at far beyond visual range. It also provides actual targeting information so the pilot can engage threats using the IRST for targeting alone, or in conjunction with other sensors, which offers important advantages. This additional means of spotting, tracking, and engaging aircraft passively eliminates the chance of alerting potential opponents that they’ve been detected, unlike radar that can give away the attacking aircraft’s presence and even its location. On top of all this, the IRST provides an alternative to the radar in electronic warfare-heavy (jamming) combat environments and radar-evading design features on stealth aircraft have no effect on the IRST. It depends on the aircraft’s infrared signature alone. A large portion of the Eagle test fleet is taking part in Northern Edge 2019., USAF A specially equipped, Edwards AFB based, test F-15C takes gas during a Northern Edge sortie., USAF Lockheed Martin developed the IRST21 sensor from the AN/AAS-42 IRST system it had supplied for the F-14D Tomcat . Another version of that earlier sensor system, known as Tiger Eyes, also found its way onto newer export versions of the F-15E Strike Eagle. You can read much more about the IRST21, its predecessors and the capabilities IRST sensors offer, in general, here . The Legion Pod flew for the first time on an F-15C in 2016, having already gone through trials on an F-16 Viper the year before. In 2017, the Air Force picked the Lockheed Martin pod over Northrop Grumman’s OpenPod and work has been ongoing since then to fully integrate into the service’s Eagles. As of November 2018, the Air Force’s plan was still to reach initial operational capability with the system on the F-15C in 2020. Lockheed Martin The Legion Pod on the F-15C is just another example of the IRST21’s growing popularity within the U.S. military, as well. U.S. Navy Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are also getting this sensor , coupled with a modified centerline drop tank. Lockheed Martin’s IRST21 is also a feature on the Air Force’s Talon HATE communications node pod, which you can read about more here . IRST capability is likely to be just one feature of the Legion Pod on the Air Force’s F-15C as time goes on, too, and the system could easily migrate to other platforms in the future. From the very beginning, Lockheed Martin has touted the pod’s open-architecture design and available extra payload space, which could accommodate additional sensors, electronic warfare systems, communications equipment, and more. Lockheed Martin This also opens a path for greater network connectivity that could help share and fuse information from multiple sources to give pilots a much more complete understanding of the battlespace and their position within it. But even just with the core IRST functionality, it makes good sense that Nellis sent an F-15C with the Legion Pod to take part in Northern Edge. This scale and scope of the exercise can only make it a particularly great opportunity to put it through the paces ahead of the system’s planned fielding next year. In addition to F-15Cs, including on the carrying the Legion Pod, Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighters , F-16C Vipers , and F-15E Strike Eagles are taking part in Northern Edge 2019. U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters and U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler jamming aircraft and P-8A Poseidon patrol planes are participating, too. https://youtube.com/watch?v=BYXp8qJGHmc Beyond that, the Navy’s Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt , along with its associated Carrier Strike Group and Carrier Air Wing 11, which includes F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and E-2 Hawkeye radar planes, are also participating . This is the first time in a decade that a flattop has joined Northern Edge. An F/A-18E Super Hornet launches from the deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt during Northern Edge 2019., USN Northern Edge’s scale and scope mean that the various branches of the U.S. military routinely use it as a proving ground for new and advanced systems. In 2017, the U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane took part for the first time ever, but in a novel role as high-flying communication relay platform equipped with a system known as the “ Einstein Box .” Since the exercise occurs in both over-land and maritime environments, it will offer a great chance to explore the IRST’s capabilities against a variety of targets under various conditions. With thousands of personnel and hundreds of aircraft taking part, its an ideal chance to see how the system could integrate into a large force scenario and examine any data-sharing and networking capabilities it might have already. Northern Edge 2019 is set to wrap up on May 24, 2019. As the Air Force moves toward to its planned initial operational capability date for the Legion Pod on the F-15C, it seems very likely that we’ll be seeing the system on Eagles during other major exercises as the year continues.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 27, 2020",The Air Force’s New HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter Has Taken Flight For The First Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sikorsky’s new HH-60W Combat Rescue Helicopter, or CRH, for the U.S. Air Force flew today for the first time at the company’s facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. The service hopes to put the helicopter into low-rate production this fall and move forward in replacing its fleet of aging HH-60G Pave Hawks , which has struggled to meet its operational demands in recent years. The HH-60W’s first flight occurred on May 17, 2019 , and lasted just over an hour and it included various hovering and low-speed maneuvers, according to an official press release. Lockheed Martin, who now owns Sikorsky, says that a second CRH prototype will begin flight testing next week and a total of four helicopters will be flying by the end of the summer. The Air Force, which expects to buy a total of 113 HH-60Ws, plans to make its production decision in September 2019. “With the Combat Rescue Helicopter’s successful first flight now behind us, we look forward to completion of Sikorsky’s flight test program, operational testing and production of this aircraft to support the Air Force’s critical rescue mission,” Edward Stanhouse, the head of the Air Force’s Helicopter Program Office, said in a statement . “Increased survivability is key and we greatly anticipate the added capabilities this aircraft will provide.” The HH-60W is derived from Sikorsky’s UH-60M Black Hawk , which is in service with the U.S. Army, among other operators. The CRH features a number of unique features, including a nose-mounted radar and sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, a new version of the AN/APR-52 radar warning receiver (RWR) system to detect incoming threats, Air Force-specific crashworthy seats for the crew and passengers, and a new long-range fuel system. The tank in the revised fuel system has roughly twice the capacity of the UH-60M. The HH-60W will also retain various features from the latest HH-60Gs, including the same external weapons mounts on either side of the fuselage. These provide side-firing weapons at the two crew chief windows and can accept 7.62mm Miniguns or .50 caliber GAU-18/A or GAU-21/A machine guns. A US Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk., USAF The new rescue helicopters have been a long time coming. In the early 2000s, the Air Force first began actively looking for a replacement for the HH-60G as part of the Combat Search and Rescue-X (CSAR-X) program. Boeing’s HH-47 , a CSAR version of the CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter, won that competition in 2006, but protests from both Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin, then separate companies, up-ended the deal. The following year, renewed objections to a new Air Force request for proposals led to plans to replace the HH-60Gs getting put on hold entirely. In the interim, the service acquired a small number of HH-60U helicopters, another UH-60M derivative, which have become best known for supporting security and local base rescue missions at the top-secret Area 51 test facility in Nevada. A US Air Force HH-60U., Lockheed Martin In 2012, the Air Force initiated the CRH program. After delays and threats of cancellation due to budget cuts, the service finally awarded the contract to Sikorsky for the HH-60W in 2014. Unfortunately, in the meantime, the HH-60Gs, the first of which rolled off the production lines in the 1980s, have become increasingly old and hard to maintain, despite a number of upgrade programs over the years. Last year, reports of growing structural fatigue and other issues across the Pave Hawk fleet began to emerge, underscoring the seriousness of the situation. At the same time, the rescue helicopters and their crews have been in especially high demand , adding to the strain on the airframes. By 2018, on average, each of the Air Force’s Pave Hawks had already logged around 7,100 flight hours, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The type’s original service life was just 6,000 hours and some individual aircraft relegated to training duties had racked up more than 10,000 hours. A look at average flight hours across the HH-60G fleet as of May 2018., GAO But while the Air Force sorely needs new rescue helicopters, there are still a number of potential hurdles the HH-60W will have to overcome. In its most recent annual report on the program , covering developments during the 2018 Fiscal Year, the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operation Test and Evaluation, also known as DOT&E, cited a number of potential risks. “Qualification testing of many components of the aircraft have uncovered technical deficiencies that the Program Office is working to resolve,” the report, which came out in February 2019, explained. “As a result, the program will begin flight test and operational assessment (OA-2) with a large number of CRH-specific systems in non-operationally representative configurations.” The systems that may not be “operationally representative” include the “tactical mission kit, Link 16 [data link], digital RWR, rescue hoist, gun mount and systems, fuel cells, armor, and primary aircrew seating.” Earlier testing showed the initial version of the new fuel cell, one of the HH-60W’s key features, was overweight and did not meet various protective and temperature requirements. “The Program Office intends to proceed with modified criteria which will allow some fuel cell leakage to be considered a pass of the specification,” according to DOT&E. The cockpit and main cabin armor also failed certain tests, as did the aircrew seating. “Phase II qualification testing significantly damaged a production-representative live fire test aircraft structural component, the repair of which may further delay live fire fuel cell testing several months or necessitate a change in the LFT&E [Live Fire Test and Evaluation] Strategy if the article cannot be repaired,” the report added. The updated armor package is also 20 percent heavier the original design. Concept art of the expected final HH-60W configuration., Lockheed Martin The added weight of both the fuel system and the armor could impact the aircraft’s performance and range, both of which are important to the combat search and rescue mission. The HH-60W press release does not mention these issues and whether they have gotten resolved or if there are plans in place already to mitigate them. There are already questions and concerns about how well any traditional helicopter will be able to perform in a future high-end conflict in the face of ever-more-threatening integrated air defense networks, especially in the event that a stealthy aircraft gets shot down . These planes will be routinely operating in areas that are, by definition, too dangerous for non-stealthy platforms to fly. Of course, in lower threat environments, the HH-60W will continue to be an important part of the combat search and rescue toolbox, especially with support from other aircraft to suppress and destroy enemy air defenses. The crews flying HH-60Gs now can certainly not afford to wait much longer for replacement helicopters. Hopefully, Sikorsky and the Air Force are already well on their way to rectifying any of the CRH’s remaining issues so that the service can begin fielding the new helicopters, as planned, in 2020.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2018",Russia Fires Off Multiple ICBMs and Cruise Missiles During Massive Nuclear Drill,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain scarce but Russia has officially stated that they executed a major strategic snap drill today that saw three submarine launched ballistic missiles, an ICBM, and an unknown number of air-launched cruise missiles being fired off in a very short period of time. The official statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense reads (automatic translation): “October 26, 2017 in accordance with the Armed Forces Training Plan RF [Russian Forces] conducted training on the management of Russia’s Strategic Nuclear Forces. To participate in the training, forces and means of the ground, sea and aviation component of the Strategic Nuclear Forces of the Russian Federation were involved. During the training, the practical actions of the combat calculations of the command posts of the Missile Forces with the strategic purposes, crews of nuclear missile submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, strategic missile carriers and bombers of the Long-range Aviation of the Air and Space Forces. Long-range aircraft Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3, which took off from the basic airfields “Ukrainka”, “Engels”, and “Shaikavka”, launched airborne cruise missiles based on ground targets at the “Kura” Kamchatka), Pemba (Republic of Komi) and Terekt (Kazakhstan). From the State Plesetsk cosmodrome, the combat calculation of the Strategic Missile Forces launched the launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Topol on the Kura test range. The nuclear submarine of the Pacific Fleet launched a salvo launch of two ballistic missiles from the water of the Sea of Okhotsk along the “Chizha” (Arkhangelsk region), from the water area of the Barents Sea the nuclear submarine of the Northern Fleet launched a ballistic missile at the Kura landfill. The tasks of the training were carried out in full, all the learning goals were successfully amazed.” Here is footage supposedly from the drill released by the Russian Ministry of Defense: The exercise is among the most comprehensive in recent memory, with the nuclear-capable missile launches occurring in both hemispheres and from the sea, land, and air. The War Zone began tracking reports of peculiarly heightened communications and air traffic among Russia strategic forces earlier in the day. Those reports turned out to be accurate, with Moscow disclosing the exercise shortly after it concluded. Nuclear posturing is becoming far more in vogue than it was just months ago, and it’s not just a foreign phenomenon. NATO just wrapped up a major nuclear exercise, which was clearly aimed at Russia whether they admit it or not. The Pentagon has also becoming far more cavalier when it comes to discussing, if not outright showcasing, its own nuclear capabilities and readiness in recent months. This attitude shift has even spilled over into social media . With the relationship between the U.S. and Russia at an all time low and a potential conflict with North Korea brewing, not to mention a White House that seems far more casual about nuclear weaponry than past administrations and billions being funneled into new American nuclear weaponry , this “new normal” is likely to get even more pronounced, not less. Even China is becoming more inclined to brandish its strategic weaponry as of late. But these drills, which likely were an “end to end” test of Russia’s nuclear weapons apparatus, including the complex command and control network that goes along with it, was an especially ominous display. Now we’ll have to wait to see how Washington reacts. We will updated this post over the next 12 hours if more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019",The Harrowing Tale Of The Nuke-Laden Russian Typhoon Class Sub That Almost Sunk In 1991,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A man whose quick and bold thinking likely saved the world from a nuclear disaster has died. The Barents Observer reports that Igor Grishkov, the 67 year old retired Russian Navy captain, passed away in Severodvinsk, located along the frigid White Sea. Grishkov had lived there since retiring from the Russian Navy. 27 years earlier, then Captain Grishkov was in command of one of six of the deadliest weapons the Soviet Union ever created, the massive Typhoon class nuclear ballistic missile (SSBN) submarine TK-17. It was during the most turbulent time in Russian affairs since WWII when TK-17 slunk beneath the waves in the White Sea, not far from the place of his death, that Grishkov was faced with one of a nuclear submariner’s worst nightmare scenarios. The near catastrophic event remained deeply classified for decades, but today we have a decent idea of what happened on that fateful day in September of 1991. Igor Grishkov , Image from Facebook via Barents Observer TK-17 was ordered to execute a test launch of one of its 20 SS-N-20 Sturgeon (locally called the R-39 Rif) submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Like their host submarine, these three-stage solid-fuel ballistic missiles were absolutely massive in size, weighing a staggering 185,000 pounds and able to carry up to ten multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs). A early photo of a Typhoon class SSBN with a graphic comparing it to a football field. , Public Domain A test missile, which had inert warheads, was loaded into one of TK-17’s vertical launch tubes before the submarine headed out to sea. Once launched, it would fly thousands of miles east, impacting on Russia’s missile range on the Chukotka Peninsula . The exercise was largely a display of continuity, strength, and stability to a world which had just witnessed a failed coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. In reality, the Soviet Union was in a state of collapse, and by Christmas of that same year it would disintegrate in full. Foreshadowing events to come politically for the USSR, the test launch turned into a harrowing failure. On September 27th, 1991, TK-17 moved into launch depth position and ran through its pre-firing sequence. As the launch clock clicked down towards zero, instead of the 53 foot long, 23 foot wide missile boosting its way towards the ocean’s surface it exploded while still cocooned inside its launch tube. The silo door that covered the missile tube was totally blown off. The submarine shook violently and alarms rang—it seemed as if the TK-17 was doomed. Such an event would be horrific for the boat’s crew, but the loss of control of the vessel’s twin nuclear reactors and the live nuclear weapons it carried could result in a nuclear incident of massive proportions. In essence, the loss of a Typhoon class SSBN was the sum of Soviet Navy’s fears. A picture of a ice covered Typhoon class SSBN likely taken sometime in the 1980s., Bellona Foundation/wikicommons Grishkov acted quickly and decisively, ordering up an emergency blow of TK-17’s ballast tanks, a move that would send the 574 foot long submarine porpoising to the surface. The action was completed successfully and TK-17’s crew was able visually examine the submarine’s long forward-set missile farm. What they saw wasn’t good. There were a series of fires raging near where the test missile had detonated. The missile’s solid fuel propellant had scattered across the submarine’s upper surface. The rubber anechoic coating that helps the submarine from being detected acoustically was set alight and the fire would rapidly spread. 19 other missiles sat tightly packed in two neat lines of ten under and near the blaze. Heat and ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads are a bad combination. Once again, Captain Grishkov acted quickly and decisively, ordering a counter-intuitive maneuver for a submarine that is damaged in ways that crew couldn’t fully understood at the time. Dive! Dive! Dive! His plan was to put the fire out in a way only a submarine can, by submerging the vessel and starving the flames of oxygen. Grishkov knew that the stricken missile’s launch compartment would flood, and possibly other sections nearby, and alerted the crew to this possibility, but he had to make a decision that would save the boat from sinking , even if it meant taking on new types of damage and even possibly casualties. A Typhoon class sub sits in port. , Georges DeKeerle/Sygma via Getty Images) The crew carried out the snap order far quicker than it could normally have been accomplished. When the boat was ordered back up to the surface again the fires were extinguished. The plan had worked and TK-17 wouldn’t become the embarrassment of a crumbling empire or the cause of an international crisis and environmental catastrophe. The stricken submarine and its crew of 160 limped back to Severodvinsk where its burnt skin and badly damaged launch tube were repaired under a shroud of secrecy. The tube would never be used again and was permanently sealed off. TK-17 would go onto serve for 13 more years before being sidelined in 2004. Grishkov was never pronounced a Hero of Russia or given an award for staving off disaster, the impact of which is hard to fathom, especially at such a turbulent time in Russian history. The Kursk tragedy nearly nine years later, which had clear parallels to the incident aboard TK-17, was controversially handled in a standoff manner by Russia, and the country wasn’t undergoing anywhere near the political turmoil as the Soviet Union was in the fall of 1991. Three of the six Typhoon class boats produced still exist, with just one remaining in active service. The other two, seen here in a 2013 satellite image, which includes TK-17, await the scrapper’s torch and the removal of their nuclear reactors., Digital Globe via Getty Images Would Russia have reached out for help if one of their prized Typhoon class boomers sunk? Would embarrassment and the sensitive technology held within the relatively new submarine—the most advanced fielded at the time of the incident—kept the Soviet Union from telling the world of the disaster before it was too late? How would the overthrow of the Communist Party just months later have impacted a response effort, especially if it was highly classified at the time of the political transformation? Thanks to Captain Grishkov and his crew we don’t have an answer to those questions. The lack of adulation towards Grishkov was largely due to the sensitive nature of the incident. Although some of the Russian Navy brass wanted to decorate him for his heroic efforts on that day, instead the powers that be chose to keep the incident secret . In turn, neither the captain or any of his crew, who all survived the incident, would ever receive the recognition they deserved. SEVEROMORSK, RUSSIA – JULY 15, 2017: The Dmitriy Donskoy (TK-208) nuclear ballistic missile submarine leaves for St Petersburg to take part in a ship parade marking Russian Navy Day., Lev FedoseyevTASS via Getty Images As for TK-17, the vessel has been sitting idle ( take a look inside !) in Severodvinsk next to her sister-ship TK-20 awaiting decommissioning and disposal of their volatile nuclear reactors.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 19, 2020",Pentagon’s New Nuclear Strategy Is Unsustainable And A Handout To Defense Industry,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I had high hopes that the Pentagon’s Nuclear Posture Review would lay out a creative new strategy that would save money when it comes to sustaining and modernizing America’s hideously expensive nuclear arsenal. It ended up doing just the opposite. Basically an “and the kitchen sink too” document, it not only maintains and modernizes the current nuclear triad , but also expands upon it with calling for new iterations of established delivery systems as well as a developing a whole new one as well. Most controversially it looks to field more “usable” nuclear weapons in some nebulous attempt to deter an enemy’s own use of low-yield tactical nukes during a limited conflict. This is sometimes referred to as “escalate to de-escalate,” but regardless of the tactics involved, really this document represents a handout to defense contractors of monumental proportions and above all else, a unsustainable and highly expensive strategy overall. Just modernizing the nuclear arsenal we have today was slated to cost roughly $1.5T with inflation over the next 30 years and that is without the new initiatives laid out by the Strategic Posture Review. These include the introduction of low-yield warheads for the D5 Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile, the reintroduction of a nuclear-tipped naval cruise missile, and the development of nuclear-armed hypersonic weapons that will become a whole new medium of delivery in the coming decades. USAF Before the review was released the Pentagon was already working on new ICBMs , new Columbia class ballistic missile carrying submarines, new stealthy B-21 nuclear bombers , a new guided variant of the B61 tactic nuclear bomb dubbed the B61-12, and a new air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missile dubbed the LRSO . Basically a totally remodeled nuclear arsenal along with all the command and control architecture that supports it. Now, according to the Strategic Posture Review and the Pentagon’s overall strategy going forward, this is not nearly enough. AGM-86 cruise missiles being loaded on a B-52H. The AGM-86B is the country’s sole nuclear air launched cruise missile after the retirement of the AGM-129., USAF Many have argued, including the author of this article, for the potential elimination or reduction of the ground-based Minuteman III ICBM inventory in particular. This leg of the nuclear triad acts as a massive “nuclear sponge” to soak up hundreds of enemy warheads during a conflict more than anything else. This strategy is almost laughable if it weren’t so alarming. Maybe it would save the US from direct attacks on a number of secondary targets in populated areas, but what will be left of the US, or even the world eventually, once fallout from hundreds of thermonuclear weapons that pummeled the central part of the country takes effect. The ICBM leg is not nearly as survivable as the ballistic missile submarine leg nor is it anywhere near as flexible as the nuclear bomber leg of the triad and its assortment of weaponry. Eliminating the ICBM leg of the triad could save hundreds of billions of dollars that could be invested in expanding America’s nuclear ballistic submarine force and on a whole slew of other capabilities the Pentagon says it desperately needs. Instead, under the Nuclear Posture Review, we are going to be sticking roughly 400 new missiles into existing Minuteman III silos. Minuteman III missile receiving upgrade. , USAF Some will say that America’s ICBM force is “an insurance policy” against the other two legs of the triad experiencing technical failure or being knocked out before they can launch their deadly payloads. Considering that our second strike deterrent relies on those submarines primarily, such an argument is questionable at best. And by moving substantial funds to the nuclear ballistic submarine (SSBN) program, that second strike deterrent would only become more survivable and dense. But even if the triad remains intact in full, do we really need to spend billions on new delivery systems beyond what was already planned? For instance, the nuclear tipped naval cruise missile seems to be more of a bargaining chip to get Russia back into treaty compliance than anything else, but that’s a very costly bargaining chip to say the least. The nuclear-tipped BGM-109A Tomahawk cruise missile, usually referred to as the TLAM-N, was finally stricken from inventory just five years ago. Now a new missile would have to be developed for this purpose, and the procedures for handling and employing the weapon on American Navy ships and submarines would need to be reintroduced—a far more complex and expensive proposition than one might think. Boeing Equipping Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles for tactical nuclear delivery purposes is downright troubling. An unannounced launch of Trident missile could, or more likely would, be viewed as an incoming strategic strike, not a limited tactical one. Quite frankly, such an act could usher in the beginning to the end of the world as we know it, especially during a time of such intense conflict that a nuclear weapon of any type would be used. The ability to issue a prompt tactical nuclear strike from nearly anywhere on the globe may be attractive, but hypersonic delivery systems will fulfill that capability in the years to come anyway, for better or worse . In the end, substantially increasing the number of America’s nuclear delivery systems and making nuclear weapons “easier to use” is a reckless and extremely costly path to go down, especially without giving up something in return. And the cold hard truth is that $700B defense budgets are not sustainable. As America is forced to confront its reckless spending habits in the years to come, sustaining the nuclear arsenal we already have will become fiscally challenging—doing so with an expanded arsenal will be all but impossible. Trident missile launch, USN So what you have here is a big reactionary shot of nuclear sugar before an inevitable crash. And yes, the threat profile may be changing around the globe, and certainly a resurgent Russia is something to be dealt with by fielding a strong defense and a solid nuclear deterrent, but how many ways do you need to potentially end the world multiple times over? When it comes to tactical nuclear weapons, we already have hundreds of them forward deployed to Europe , and the F-35 would be a more cost effective and less risky delivery system than reintroducing naval cruise missiles or low-yield warheads on submarine-launched ballistic missiles. We will also have over 100 stealth bombers and 75 B-52s, not to mention a new very stealthy air-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missile to take on flexible nuclear delivery missions. So a bit of rationalization would go a long way when it comes to updating our nuclear arsenal instead of just saying “we want all of it and more.” Doing so isn’t a strategy at all, it’s a childish and irresponsible cop out to making realistic decisions that can endure for the decades to come. The Pentagon’s existing triad and its modernization plan seemed to have all the threats covered before the introduction of this expansive nuclear weapons strategy., USAF So who wins in all this? Defense contractors, and in a huge way. Nuclear weapons contracts are extremely expensive and the secrecy surrounding them helps with limiting public ridicule and even congressional oversight. But don’t blame the contractors, blame those who are making these decisions. Just going on a nuclear shopping spree while the dollars are many sets the Pentagon up for some tough, if not embarrassing triaging of fiscal priorities down the road. As such, the chances are very high that these initiatives will end up being viewed as highly wasteful and nearsighted in the not so distant future, and even integrating them into existing arms treaties is a whole other issue altogether.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 23, 2020",Two F-16s Collide During Night Training And The Blue Angels Pay A Flying Tribute To Their Lost Teammate,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A pair of Block 52 F-16CJs from the South Carolina Air National Guard’s 157th Fighter Squadron, the Swamp Foxes, collided during a night training sortie last night. Thankfully both pilots ejected safely and have been recovered in good condition. The event occurred in the “Bulldog” military operating area and Townsend Bombing Range in Jefferson Country, Georgia. The range is frequented by USAF, Navy and Marine aircraft. There have been no reports of injuries from the stricken jets’ fall to earth. The collision comes after a spate of high profile tactical fighter crashes over the last couple of weeks. Two US Navy Super Hornets collided during a daylight training mission off the coast of North Carolina on May 26th , both aircrews ejected and were recovered in good condition. Then, just last week, another Block 52 F-16C belonging to the USAF Thunderbirds was lost after performing a flyover for the USAF Academy graduation. On the same day the Blue Angels lost one of their teammates , opposing solo pilot Captain Jeff Kuss, during a demonstration training flight. Strangely, both incidents included each team’s #6 jet. AP All of these crashes are under investigation, with the Thunderbirds #6 jet, which was left largely intact and lying in a field a few miles south of Peterson AFB , having been removed just yesterday . Meanwhile, the Blue Angels, which have been hit hard by the loss of their teammate and friend, executed a moving and unique aerial display over the team’s home town of Pensacola, Florida last night. The Blue Angel’s iconic C-130 transport, lovingly known as “Fat Albert,” which was carrying Captain Kuss’s body, flew alongside lead solo pilot Ryan Chamberlain in his F/A-18 trailing a plum of white smoke. The moving affair saw thousands of people line Pensacola’s beaches and streets as the community paid tribute to the fallen hero. The team’s solos are a unit onto themselves, as their flying is some of the most dynamic and precise in the demonstration. As such, the existence of a unique bond between the two solos is a staple of the Blue Angel’s culture. With this in mind, Fat Albert had a giant gold “6” painted on its nose for the tribute mission. The two solos were united in the air one last time. A memorial will be held for the Captain at NAS Pensacola’s chapel on Thursday. Both the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds stood down from display flying following the harrowing events of June 2nd , canceling a series of appearances in the process . The Thunderbirds have since taken back to the air for formation training . So far just near-term shows have been cancelled and there is no talk of an entire season stand-down, but that could change as more details emerge as to the cause of the crashes. In the meantime, the Navy has increased its Super Hornet single-ship demo capacity to fill in the best they can for shows where the Blue Angels were supposed to appear. The Blue Angels may take more time to recover considering the severity of the incident and the loss of Captain Kuss. Just replacing a member of the flight demonstration team without a crash complicating matters is a huge issue as the team has trained as an integrated unit arduously over the winter to perform the demo with confidence and precision. In the past, when a member needed to be replaced, past Blue Angels pilots have been called upon to do so if available. This still takes training and time. It is possible that the Blue Angels could perform the demo without a #6 aircraft, changing the #5’s routine without effecting the flow of the four-ship diamond, but this would leave  the six-ship delta formation without one of its wings. Although this would look strange, it does happen already when one of the solo jets is down for service and the spare is not available or cannot launch in time. It could also be a fitting tribute to the team’s lost comrade all in itself. One thing is for certain, if and when the Navy’s bureaucracy clears the Blues to start training as a team again, the team will find a way to come back as strong as possible. I mean they are the Blue Angels, if any group of people on this planet can mount an awe inspiring comeback, it’s them.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 10, 2018",Hurricane Harvey Tracking To Directly Hit Two Major Navy Flight Training Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It has been a tough year for the U.S. Navy’s flight training community. The T-45 Goshawk fleet is still largely grounded due to repeated physiological incidents experienced by its pilots—a reality that has plugged up the Navy and Marine Corps flight training pipeline and has drastically slowed production of fresh Naval Aviators for the fleet. Now Hurricane Harvey, which has become a slow moving class two hurricane, is bearing down on the Gulf Coast in Texas with two of the Navy’s master training bases directly in its crosshairs. NAS Corpus Christi, where throngs of T-6, T-44, and TC-12 trainers are based, sits right on Corpus Christi Bay and at this point looks to be directly in the storm’s path of destruction. Harvey is predicted to strengthen to a category three hurricane by the time it makes landfall at around 10pm local time Friday evening. Even though it could pack winds as high as 125mph, at this point storm surge and rain —nearly 35 inches of it— are the biggest threats. A wall of water as high as 12 feet is forecasted to inundate the area and NAS Corpus Christi is at an elevation of just 12 feet MSL. NAS Corpus Christi is especially vulnerable to the storm and it sits in its direct path., Google Earth About 35 miles southwest of NAS Corpus Christi is NAS Kingsville, which houses roughly half of the Navy’s 200 troubled T-45 Goshawk trainers. Although NAS Kingsville sits inland, it is still near a tributary of Baffin Bay. Regardless of its proximity to a major body of water, the winds and sheets of rainfall could be very destructive. What’s most troubling is that there is no prevailing weather pattern that will predictably push the hurricane one direction or another once it hits landfall, meaning it could hang around for a long time and even double back out to towards the Gulf of Mexico. Other meteorological models have it heading toward Houston and up into eastern Texas. The lack of predictability means huge swathes of Texas are on alert and could be dramatically affected by the storm on a relatively short notice. If it were to head back toward Corpus Christi, rainfall over the coming days could total 53 inches. NAS Kingsville, with nearly 100 T-45s, most of which are grounded, will rely on its hangars to protect the aircraft., USN Just 28 of NAS Kingsville’s inventory of 99 T-45s have been evacuated, with all those jets going to NAS Fort Worth. The majority of the base’s aircraft, many of which are not flight worthy, will ride out the storm in hangars. Currently, T-45 flights are limited to instructor pilots only and even they can’t climb above 10,000 feet in the jet. NAS Corpus Christi, whose aircraft don’t suffer from the T-45’s grounding orders and flight restrictions, have also sent all their flyable aircraft to NAS Fort Worth. The rest of its aircraft will be stuffed in hangars in hopes of riding out the brunt of the storm. Non-essential personnel from both bases are also being relocated to NAS Fort Worth as well. Clearly it is going to be a busy and crowded weekend at the base which is located near Dallas. We will keep you informed in the coming days as to the condition of both bases.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 8, 2022",This Robot The 10th Mountain Is Testing Could Become The Army’s Revolutionary Mechanical Donkey,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division has posted videos online of troops from its 1st Brigade testing a new small unmanned ground vehicle , or UGV, called the Punisher. The evaluation is part of a larger program, which is looking to develop a system to help carry equipment and provide mobile power generation for small infantry units. But the vehicles could take on additional missions in the future, acting as weapons carriers, small ambulances, and more. The 10th Mountain is conducting the evaluations within the latest iteration of the division’s major readiness exercise, nicknamed Mountain Peak , which began in the training areas outside of Fort Drum, New York in November 2018. Various units within the 1st Brigade will use the Punisher, a product of the Maine-based firm Howe & Howe, along with the Polaris MRZR-X , the 8×8 version of General Dynamics Land Systems’ Multipurpose Unmanned Tactical Transport (MUTT), and the HDT Global Hunter Wheeled Offload Logistics Follower (Hunter WOLF). Troops will report back with their findings to the officials in charge of the Army’s Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) program. “I’m not an Infantry Soldier,” U.S. Army Captain Erika Hanson, the Assistant Product Manager for SMET, told the service’s reporters in June 2018 . “But I’ve carried a rucksack – and I can tell you I can move a lot faster without a rucksack on my back. Not having to carry this load will make the Soldier more mobile and more lethal in a deployed environment.” In December 2017, the service chose the present field of four vehicles from a total of eight to proceed to the SMET program’s operational evaluation phase with the 10th Mountain Division. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division is also conducting an evaluation of the same unmanned vehicles. A composite image of the four winners of the SMET program’s first phase. Clockwise from the top left, the Howe & Howe Punisher, the HDT Hunter WOLF, the General Dynamics MUTT, and the Polaris MRZR-X., US Army The MUTT and Hunter WOLF are both wheeled platform designs, while the entrant from Howe & Howe, now a division of defense contractor Textron , is the only tracked type remaining. The MRZR-X, which Polaris developed in cooperation with Applied Research Associates Inc. and Neya Systems LLC, is an optionally-manned version of the first company’s popular MRZR all-terrain vehicle . This vehicle is already in service with U.S. special operations forces, the Marine Corps, and some conventional Army units. The basic SMET requirements are for an unmanned all-terrain transport vehicle that can carry up to 1,000 pounds and be able to travel 60 miles in total over a 72 hour period without needing to refuel its gas tanks or recharge its batteries, depending on propulsion method. The vehicle must have a power generation system, as well, that can support an ever-expanding array of electronics, including communications gear , hand-held sensors , portable navigation systems , and electronic warfare equipment , that small Army units carry with them even on short-duration operations. Troops will be able to operate these “ robotic pack mules ” using controls on the vehicle itself or a handheld controller. The portable system will also have a video screen linked to cameras on the UGV to allow for remote operation. A “follow-me” functionality, in which the vehicle will keep a set distance between it and the control system at all times, is also a requirement. “Nine ruck sacks, six boxes of MREs, and four water cans,” was a notional load Captain Hanson used to describe the desired payload capacity for the SMET. “This is about the equivalent of what a long-range mission for a light Infantry unit would need to carry.” A briefing slide from April 2018 giving a basic overview of the SMET program., US Army With the unmanned transporter, the squad- or platoon-sized unit would be able to carry even more weapons, ammunition, equipment, and other gear, or be able to reduce the physical workload on individual soldiers. At present, dismounted Army infantry soldiers are easily carrying close to, if not more than 100 pounds for even relatively short-term missions. The service is looking for ways to lighten individual pieces of equipment , but is also looking to add more capabilities on top of the existing load outs. New electronics will also require recharging in the field, a critical capability that the SMETs will be able to provide, as well. As such, the unmanned vehicles may be an increasingly necessary addition to small units. A now-dated briefing slide from circa 2011-2012 that still gives a good sense of how much equipment members of dismounted infantry units have to carry., US Army The vehicles could also take on other roles beyond simple cargo carrying in the future. In her June 2018 interview , Captain Hanson described one novel application, where troops put a radio on the UGV and sent it out to a remote point to act as a communications relay without putting personnel at risk. With a 1,000-pound payload capacity, the vehicles have the capacity to serve as mobile platforms for weapons that would be too heavy for dismounted infantry to carry with them on routine patrols and short-range operations. HDT has already shown off a version of the Hunter WOLF equipped with a .50 caliber machine gun on a remote weapon station. Howe & Howe derived the Punisher, which the 10th Mountain’s soldiers are already confusingly referring to by the separate name Grizzly, from its earlier RS2-H1 design , which featured a similar weapon system, as well as equipment to disable or destroy improvised explosive devices and mines. A Hunter WOLF with a remote weapon station with a .50 caliber machine gun., Joseph Trevithick Those same weapon stations could accommodate anti-tank guided missiles, such as the FGM-148 Javelin , or grenade launchers for additional firepower. The Army is looking to add launchers for small drones and loitering munitions on manned and optionally-manned armored vehicles in the future, which is another option for even small unmanned systems. This would help improve a unit’s situational awareness and give it another option to conduct indirect attacks on opponents. Combined with a semi-autonomous route following capability or beyond-line-of-sight control systems, the vehicles might be able to rush badly needed supplies to frontline units without risks to manned logistical vehicles or aircraft. Those same unmanned systems could load up any casualties and race them back to more established medical facilities. An armed Howe & Howe RS2-H1, Howe & Howe Though unmanned vehicles offer significant benefits for small unit operations, there will still be challenges if the Army decides to introduce them on a wide scale. For one, they are substantially larger than anything a dismounted infantry unit is expected to carry at present and if they were to break down for any reason, soldiers might be forced to, at least temporarily, abandon the vehicle and some of the cargo it might be carrying. Small units will also need to train to perform basic maintenance on these vehicles in the field. The requirement for a total operating range of 60 miles over three days without resupply might clash with the Army’s recently articulated desire for brigade-sized units to be able to operate for at least a week without outside logistical support, as well. These are hardly new issues for the Army, which has been looking to acquire a fleet of small unmanned vehicles to help reduce combat and logistical burdens on small units for more than a decade. The infamous and now-canceled Future Combat Systems (FCS) program included the XM1217 transport unmanned ground vehicle. Lockheed Martin’s “Animal,” the prototype for the XM1217 transport, a component of the Future Combat Systems program, which the Army canceled in 2009., US Army But the technology required for unmanned ground vehicles, especially semi-autonomous designs, has come along way since the Army canceled FCS in 2009. The significant progress in the commercial sector on self-driving trucks and cars , in particular, has been a game changer and has only bolstered continued developments within the U.S. military . Advances in electric and hybrid-electric drive systems and associated power sources, including hydrogen fuel cell technology , have also pushed the idea of unmanned ground combat vehicles closer to reality. The U.S. Marine Corps has also taken note and has been evaluating unmanned ground vehicles, including the 4×4 version of the General Dynamics MUTT with tracks in place of wheels and the HDT Hunter WOLF, for some time. The Corps is interested in these vehicles for both cargo-carrying tasks and as mobile fire support platforms. The two services might well find themselves cooperating on a joint effort to field unmanned ground vehicles in the near future. The Army hopes that the SMET program will pick a winning design by 2020 and have the first examples actually operational by 2021. The service says it could buy more than 5,700 of the small unmanned ground vehicles in total. If the project proceeds as planned, it might not be too long before soldiers are conducting operations with unmanned partners to carry their supplies and more.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 12, 2018",Huge Chaff Cloud That Lit Up Radars As It Drifted Across The Midwest Remains A Mystery,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, meteorologists, and anyone else watching weather radar in southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and western Kentucky, noticed an unusual formation drifting through the area. Although evidence remains limited, this was likely a burst of chaff released from a U.S. military aircraft, but there is still no clear explanation as to why the plane released the radar-reflecting countermeasures in this particular area. At around 3:00 PM Central Time on Dec. 10, 2018, weathermen at local news stations in the area, as well as a National Weather Service (NWS) in Paducah, Kentucky, began tracking the radar “blob” as it dramatically expanded in length and began to move southward. Closer to 2:00 AM Central Time on Dec. 11, 2018, Wayne Hart, the Chief Meteorologist at ABC-affiliate WEHT in Evansville, Indiana, took to Twitter to offer the first real information about the radar reflective plume. “Information from a pilot appears to confirm that chaff was the mysterious radar echo that traversed #tristatewx late Monday afternoon/evening,” Hart Tweeted out. “Pilot was told by EVV [Evansville Regional Airport] Air Traffic Control that chaff was released by a military C130 [sic] northwest of Evansville.” There has been no additional information about what specific service or unit the C-130 might have belonged to or what variant or subvariant it might have been. Hart also did not explain what the purpose of the release might have been beyond telling another Twitter user that it had been related to an unspecified military exercise. We have to stress that this explanation is far from official or corroborated in any tangible way. The War Zone has reached out to the Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky National Guards as well as the U.S. Air Force seeking confirmation and more information. The Illinois Air National Guard’s 182nd Airlift Wing, which does operate C-130s, told us that it only had one aircraft airborne on Dec. 10, 2018, and that it was not carrying chaff at all. At the time of writing, we have not received responses to any of our other queries. First developed during the Second World War, chaff consists of bundles of radar reflective material, commonly aluminum strips or bundles of metalized glass fibers. These types of material are extremely reflective on radar and as seen in the tracks above, can blind and confuse radars and their operators. The size of the individual strips or strands has a direct impact on what radar bands the chaff affects. C-130 types do have the ability to fire chaff from their AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispensing system. The aircraft may have also had a launcher mounted on its rear cargo ramp or fitted in either of the two paratrooper doors on either side of the rear fuselage, that is if a C-130 is responsible for this puzzling countermeasures deployment. US Navy RR-144, at top, and RR-129 chaff countermeasures, as well as loose chaff, at right. These are similar in basic function to the chaff countermeasures that various C-130 type aircraft use., USN Countermeasures dispensers on a C-130 type aircraft. The dispensers on the left are loaded with decoy flares that burn in the visual light spectrum, while the ones on the right most likely have infrared flares. Both of these are used to counter heat-seeking missiles. These same dispensers can also hold chaff cartridges if required., USAF During an actual military operation, fighters jets and other combat aircraft would fire chaff defensively to make it difficult for fire control radars or the seekers on radar-guided air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles to track and engage them. Bulk chaff deployments could help conceal the total number of aircraft involved in a mission or their exact direction of movement. During the invasion of Iraq in 2003, ground- and air-launched modified BQM-34 drones dumped chaff along specific corridors to conceal Tomahawk cruise missiles as they flew toward their targets. Using chaff during exercises is hardly unheard of and rapidly changing environmental factors, including changes in ambient wind speed and direction, means it can often blow off course. For example, in 2011 , chaff appeared on weather radar in northeastern Oregon. In 2013 and again in 2016 , similar plumes appeared on radar near the Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. The video below shows radar tracks of much smaller trails of chaff during the incident near Redstone Arsenal in 2013. “Threat countermeasure testing conducted at the U.S. Army Redstone Test Center Wednesday, September 21st, [2016,] resulted in the release of chaff into the atmosphere on the west side of Redstone Arsenal,” the public affairs office at the Army facility said in a statement after that second incident. “While the tests were conducted strictly over the Arsenal and wind speed restrictions were adhered to, climatic factors cannot always be predicted.” But the chaff in this instance stayed in the area in excess of 10 hours and at its peak stretched along a front more than 50 miles across. The material did not start at a particularly high altitude – approximately 9,000 to 10,000 feet – and the relatively uniform wave drifted from one state into two others in succession, as well. This is unusually persistent coverage over a very large area. This could point to a test involving a more exotic type of material that hangs in the air longer. “It might be chaff released from an aircraft, but we’ve never seen it quite this hot,” National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Meffert also told the Evansville Courier & Press , referring to how reflective the material was on radar. At that time, WEHT’s Hart had not reported that it was chaff from a C-130. None of this explains why any U.S. military service would have dropped chaff in this particular location, which isn’t adjacent to any military installation, such as a research or test site. Scott Air Force Base , home to Air Mobility Command’s 375th Air Mobility Wing and the Illinois Air National Guard’s 126th Air Refueling Wing , is 75 miles to the northwest. Neither of those units flies C-130s of any type. The U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, or NSWC Crane , is similarly far away, but to the east in neighboring Indiana, and is not typically associated with aircraft research and development programs. To the South, there is the U.S. Army’s Fort Campbell , which is home to various fixed and rotary wing aircraft units, but none of which operate the C-130. It is possible that the Hart misheard the aircraft in question or that his source was confused as to the type. Various types of U.S. military fixed and rotary wing aircraft have countermeasures dispensers that employ chaff. However, the area where the chaff first begins to appear is within a so-called Military Operations Area (MOA), known as the Red Hills MOA. This is a designated piece of airspace set aside for military aircraft training activities. Red Hills MOA was the site of an F-15C Eagle fighter jet crash during a training mission in 2007 in which the aircraft’s structure gave out and it broke apart around the pilot. A map showing the Red Hills MOA. , via Skyvector.com The Red Hills MOA is relatively large, including areas of both Illinois and Indiana. We don’t know if the MOA was active at the time the plume appeared on radar, but it might help explain the incident. It is also worth noting that, even within MOAs, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has restrictions on the use of chaff that can impact air traffic and navigational radars because of the obvious hazards to civil and commercial aircraft. But still, that risk is considered somewhat low. A 1998 report on the safety of chaff, which includes evaluations of its impact on people and the environment, from the Government Accountability Office describes the concerns and what had already been done to mitigate the issue: The report noted that while chaff is effective at confusing enemy radar, it also interferes with air traffic control radar. The report said that chaff had interfered at least twice with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar but added that such events could be effectively avoided or managed. According to the report, safety risks from the use of chaff are extremely low and impacts on aircrews, aircraft, or the public are not anticipated. For example, the report found (1) no incidents of chaff interfering with satellite tracking; (2) two recorded incidents of military fighter aircraft interfering with FAA radar, but details were unavailable; (3) no documentation that chaff had caused aircraft radar systems to falsely identify nearby traffic; (4) no evidence of an aircraft engine failing after ingesting chaff; and (5) no reported accidents in which pilots were distracted by chaff. The report states that the primary safety concern is the potential for interference with FAA’s air traffic control radar but notes that DOD and FAA have agreed to restrict locations, altitudes, and times at which chaff can be used. The report states that a newer type of chaff that does not interfere with FAA radar is readily available. At this time, that is what we have to report. The incident is odd because it should be readily explainable on an official level. It very well could have been a C-130, but why was it punching out chaff at a relatively low altitude over that seemingly odd location on a Monday afternoon. And what type of chaff was able to stay airborne and in a relatively cohesive formation for nearly half a day after being released at 10,000 feet? Hopefully, we will find out this and more in the coming hours and days. We will keep you up to date as we continue to investigate. Update 12/12/18: We have obtained new information about this incident, which you can find here .

It’s no secret that The War Zone is a fan of Eagle Dynamics’ hyper-realistic flight simulator Digital Combat Simulator World , better known as DCS World. So it’s exciting to see the company offer the first glimpse of its upcoming F-16C Block 50 module. But it now comes with an unusual added twist as one of the company’s programmers, Oleg Tishchenko, is now sitting in the Weber County Jail in Utah charged with attempting to smuggle sensitive U.S. military aircraft flight manuals related to the F-16 Viper and the F-22 Raptor back home in violation of the U.S. government’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITARs . On May 17, 2019, Eagle Dynamics released a screenshot, seen at the top of this story, of the simulated cockpit the company has designed for the forthcoming F-16 module. In the initial early access release of the software, Eagle Dynamics says the update for DCS will include a fully recreated Block 50 Viper cockpit with “Color Multifunction Display (CMFD) symbology, Horizontal Situation Display (HSD) format, and Head-up Display (HUD) symbology” and “Digitally [sic] TACAN [Tactical Air Navigation System] and Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI),” according to a company news release from February 2019 . The company had posted another view on its Facebook page the day before. Both pictures show the kind of overall quality and impressive attention to detail that we’ve come to expect from Eagle Dynamics. The first screenshot of the F-16C cockpit from the upcoming module for DCS World that Eagle Dynamics had released on May 16, 2019., Eagle Dynamics But these first glimpses of the future add-on come just days after Ogden, Utah’s Standard-Examiner newspaper broke the news that officials in the country of Georgia had arrested Tishchenko earlier this year and extradited him to the United States. American authorities arraigned him in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah in Salt Lake City on March 15, 2019. Nearly four weeks later, U.S. Magistrate Brooke Wells signed a detention order declaring him to be a flight risk and he’s been in the Weber County Jail ever since. The 42-year old programmer has pled not guilty and his trial is scheduled to begin on Aug. 19, 2019. A picture of Oleg Tishchenko from his profile on the Russian social media site VKontakte., via Meduza The U.S. government has charged Tishchenko with one count each of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, violation of the Arms Export Control Act , smuggling goods from the United States, attempted violation of the Arms Export Control Act, and attempts to smuggle goods from the United States. You can find a copy of the full indictment here . All of this centers around the Russian’s purchase and attempts to purchase U.S. Air Force “Technical Order” manuals for various models of the F-16, as well as the F-22. The cover sheet for an F-16A/B manual from the same series as the ones that Oleg Tishchenko allegedly bought and sold in violation of the Arms Export Control Act., USAF Tishchenko has had a lifelong interest in military aviation and is a graduate of the Moscow Aviation Institute with a major in control systems, informatics, and electric utilities, according to Latvian-based online newspaper Meduza . He has been working for Eagle Dynamics since 2004 and is apparently well known for his love of acquiring flight and other military aircraft manuals. These purchasing habits, which including buying older manuals off eBay, apparently caught the attention of U.S. authorities all the way back in 2011. At that time, Tishchenko made a post on the Eagle Dynamic’ DCS World online forum asking for help in physically obtaining two maintenance manuals for certain F-16A/B configurations, which he was looking to buy. The seller was refusing to ship them overseas. These manuals are unclassified, but contain information subject to ITAR and the Arms Export Control Act. The regulations expressly prohibit the export of anything, including manuals, that contains technical information on systems listed in the U.S. Munitions List without a proper license. Exporting material subject to these provisions to Russia, as well as a number of other countries, is banned entirely. A sample of warnings found inside an F-16A/B manual from the same series as the ones that Oleg Tishchenko allegedly bought and sold in violation of the Arms Export Control Act., USAF So, when Tishchenko went on the forum to find someone who would take delivery of the manuals from the eBay seller and then ship them on to him in Russia, other individuals warned him that he could be in violation of the law. The man who agreed to forward the manuals on to Russia, Kenneth Sullivan, who went by the user name “Moby,” is also named on the indictment as a party to the conspiracy, but the U.S. government dropped those charges as part of an agreement, the details of which they have not publicly released. American authorities also allege that Tishchenko subsequently sold copies of these manuals, as well as others with export controlled information, on eBay without appropriate export licenses on multiple occasions between 2011 and 2015. But there’s another wrinkle that the indictment doesn’t clearly spell out. The last two charges are tied to Tishchenko alleged attempt to purchase two manuals related to the Block 50 F-16C/D, the subject of the new DCS World module, as well as the F-22. This was the product of a sting operation that the Department of Homeland Security and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations orchestrated, according to the Standard-Examiner . There’s no indication that the Russian programmer ever obtained these documents. There are unconfirmed reports that Hill Air Force Base in Utah supplied the actual documents undercover officers offered the programmer, which is why the Federal Government filed the charges in that state. “We need it in our work,” Tishchenko told the undercover agent posing as a seller online, according to additional documents that the Standard-Examiner obtained. “I’d like to get some maintenance manuals for the F-16C related to avionics. Actually, maintenance manuals for any jets, including the A-10.” This appears to be the final act of the U.S. government’s investigation, which resulted in the indictment, which authorities filed under seal in 2016. The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, so federal law enforcement officials had to wait until Tishchenko visited Georgia earlier this year to arrest him. How the trial will now go is anyone’s guess. The law could leave some leeway in determining whether or not an individual knowingly and willfully broke the arms control regulations. It may be hard for Tishchenko and his lawyers to argue otherwise if people online were offering warnings as early as 2011 that what he was doing could be illegal and depending on what the undercover agent told him over the course of their conversations. The written warnings in the manuals themselves are clear. But Tishchenko public defender, Wojciech Nitecki, has already moved to get the last two charges, related to the F-16C/D and F-22 manuals, dropped due to lack of evidence, though it’s unclear whether Judge Dale Kimball has responded yet or how. “He needed to develop flight simulator games,” Nitecki’s motion said, according to the Standard-Examiner . “The two [Tishchenko and the agent] have never agreed to exchange anything nor arranged the time, place, or mode of the exchange.” At the same time, Eagle Dynamics has distanced themselves from Tishchenko, acknowledging he is an employee, but saying they never sanctioned his acquisition of export controlled material to support work on DCS World. They also insist he was not involved in developing or conducting research for the F-16 module. A picture of an actual US Air Force F-16C Block 50., USAF “The Company develops all of its DCS aircraft game modules exclusively on the basis of publicly available information and has never used nor tried to obtain any classified information,” the statement read, according to video game news outlet Kotaku . An “[internal] investigation confirmed in particular that no company resources were used and that no export restricted documents were obtained or stored within the company’s systems.” Eagle Dynamics itself appears to have felt some strain from being headquartered in Moscow, where Russian national Igor Tishin founded it in 1991. The company moved its official main base of operations to Lausanne, Switzerland in 2017 . “The development of the F-16 and other modules currently in the pipeline will continue in order to further enhance the simulation experience of DCS World,” Eagle Dynamics’ statement added. “These events will not affect Eagle Dynamics’ commitment to its users and faithful community.” It will be interesting to see how this might impact Tishchenko’s defense in court later this year. It also seems like what the Eagle Dynamics’ programmer actually obtained was of relatively minor importance, but the U.S. government’s relations with Russia are at a particularly low point and there have also been a raft of government reports and news stories highlighting concerns about potential opponents, including the Russians and Chinese, only increasing their efforts to obtain information on sensitive U.S. military and commercial technologies by any means necessary. Had Tishchenko actually obtained the F-22 manual and then begun to resell it online, that could have been a serious security problem. Anything related to the F-22 , in particular, remains very tightly controlled and for good reason. The Raptor manual in question included information on the aircraft’s ordnance-carrying capabilities and the employment of those weapons, which could certainly have substantial intelligence value. In 2015, Military Times published an interview with an undercover U.S. naval intelligence officer who had delivered an F-14 Tomcat manual to known Russian intelligence agents as part of a counterintelligence operation, underscoring the potential value of these documents when they relate to more advanced aircraft. Beyond that, regardless of what Eagle Dynamics says about his involvement in the F-16 module, it seems hard to see how his indictment won’t become tied up in the add-on’s release. We’re certainly now even more eager to see the final product for ourselves. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor News & Features Simulation"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Comey’s Final Flight And The DOJ’s Controversial Gulfstream Private Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was almost satirical in its level of sensationalism. Not long after the White House delivered a letter to the FBI telling director James Comey that he has been fired, helicopters descended onto the sacked official’s motorcade as it made its way through Los Angeles. The O.J. Simpson-esque news alert ended with Comey stepping up the stairs of a glimmering Gulfstream 550 long-range private jet. The appearance of the massive luxury aircraft left many wondering if top federal officials really get to travel in such grandiose fashion on a normal basis, especially on just a short jaunt to California. The answer to that question depends on the official, but FBI directors in particular have been closely associated with high use of private jets in recent years. https://youtube.com/watch?v=PGWGv5rHIws Beyond the military’s large fleet of executive transports—ranging in size from King Airs to 757s, not counting the presidential airlift mission’s famous C-32As and VC-25As—the federal government has a massive private aircraft inventory. Some agencies even have their very own air forces, like the US Department of State Air Wing . The Department of Justice, which also includes the Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Marshall Service and FBI also have their own pocket aerial armada, made up of small surveillance planes, helicopters and much larger airliner transports. The latter are used to move around prisoners, emergency response teams and other groups of people and material—often on an on-call basis. Director Comey stepping off of one of the DOJ’s G550s in New Zealand for a security conference. , AP A 2016 Government Accounting Office report claims the Federal Government has 924 aircraft spread across 11 agencies under its purview (owned or leased). The DOJ possesses 101 of these aircraft, of which 67 are fixed-wing aircraft and 26 are helicopters. For 2016, the cost to operate and maintain the DOJ’s aircraft was $62.3 million according to the report. What this report leaves out are the contracted and chartered aircraft that many agencies also use, but it does give a good glimpse of the number of static aviation assets the DoJ has at its fingertips. The DOJ fleet also includes a pair of Gulfstream G550 jets that were acquired in the 2000s to be used primarily as tools for the War On Terror, but instead ended up becoming flying chariots for the Attorney General and the head of the FBI. This reality garnered some heavy handed oversight by Congress and the glaring eye of the media. Here is a tour of a G550 with a fairly standard interior configuration: https://youtube.com/watch?v=wxUYRDNgi_Q During the economic crash of 2008, CEO’s were blasted by lawmakers for using corporate jets while simultaneously laying off employees. Meanwhile, executives from the federal government—the most in-debt entity of them all—continued to use jets with nominal oversight. In fact, Congress actually moved to buy more private jets than the Department of Defense asked for in 2009. But things would come to a head as austerity measures began to be introduced on the federal government itself. The controversy surrounding the DOJ leadership’s private jet use boiled over as sequester threatened the jobs of average government workers, including those in federal law enforcement agencies. Paired with the hyper-political state the country remains in today, some in congress wanted answers on how these high-end assets were being utilized by the FBI Director and Attorney General. In 2013, Senator Charles Grassley, then the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that because of the high cost of using these aircraft the DOJ’s head honchos should not always use the big G550s or cut back on travel overall, stating: “These luxury jets were supposedly needed for counterterrorism, but it turns out that they were used almost two-thirds of the time for jet-setting executive travel… Nobody disputes that the Attorney General and the FBI Director should have access to the secure communications, but, for instance, there’s no reason they can’t take a less expensive mode of transportation, or cut their personal travel.” An investigative report by the GAO followed the controversy. A summary of the report states: “From fiscal years 2007 through 2011, three individuals who served as Attorney General (AG) and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) accounted for 95 percent (659 out of 697 flights) of all Department of Justice (DOJ) executive non-mission flights using DOJ aircraft at a total cost of $11.4 million. Specifically, the AG and FBI Director collectively took 74 percent (490 out of 659) of all of their flights for business purposes, such as conferences, meetings, and field office visits; 24 percent (158 out of 659) for personal reasons; and 2 percent (11 out of 659) for a combination of business and personal reasons. All AGs and FBI Directors are “required use” travelers who are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for all their travel, including travel for personal reasons, because of security and communications needs. However, according to DOJ officials, while the AG has historically been required to use government aircraft for all types of travel, including personal travel, the FBI Director had, until 2011, the discretion to use commercial air service for his personal travel. DOJ officials told us this explains the AG’s greater use of DOJ aircraft for personal reasons than the FBI Director. According to DOJ and FBI flight data we reviewed, all AGs and the FBI Director provided reimbursements for their personal travel in accordance with federal requirements. The FBI also conducts flights from a covert facility to Ronald Reagan National Airport to position aircraft to transport the AG and the FBI Director. Specifically, $1.5 million of the $11.4 million for 659 AG and FBI Director flights from fiscal years 2007 through 2011 was used to fly aircraft from this facility to Ronald Reagan National Airport prior to transporting these officials to their destinations. According to the FBI, these positioning flights are necessary because, among other things, the location where the FBI maintains the aircraft is an unmarked covert facility, and at times, the FBI initiates sensitive flight operations from this site.” GAO When it comes to the DOJ brass and flying, usually the department’s two G550s are the aircraft of choice. Fittingly, one of these aircraft famously hosted the supposedly impromptu rendezvous between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at Phoenix Skyharbor Airport at the height of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. But it seems that the department now also looks to private contractors to satisfy their executive travel needs. In the case of Comey’s last flight on the government’s dime, the aircraft used was also a G550, but in this case it was registered to Tenax Aerospace . The Madison, Mississippi based company says on their website that they provide general executive transport, aerial firefighting, and special air mission executive transport capabilities. The former pretty much is what the airplane would have been doing in Los Angeles for Director Comey. Tenax describes this unique mission set on their website: “Utilizing platforms such as the G550, Tenax provides command and control long range aircraft to perform special mission operations for the highest levels of the US Government. This business model has served not only DoD branches, such as the Navy, Air Force and Army, but also non-DOD agencies like the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.” Tenax Aerospace G550 used by the DoJ., Youtube Screencap There are millions in contracts between the Tenax Aerospace and the DOJ/FBI since the fall of 2015, according to available records . These seem to be largely related to charter work done by the company’s G550 on the DOJ’s behalf. The company also provides other services which may be more controversial in nature. Tenax describes their surveillance offerings on their website as such: In an uncertain world, having multiple intelligence capabilities gives our nation’s leaders the vital information they need to make real time decisions. Tenax’s experience includes providing aerial based intelligence to our government customers, such as: IMINT SIGINT COMINT GEOINT / LiDAR ELINT IO It’s unclear if these services are also bought by the FBI, which is known to operate an extensive aerial surveillance program over the US . Other agencies, such as those under the Department of Homeland Security, could also be customers of this type of work. Regardless, it is pretty clear that Tenax Aerospace, which has ex-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency General Michael Hayden among other retired generals and high-ranking defense-related officials on its board of directions , has a special relationship with the DOJ if they are trusted to provide executive transport in specially outfitted Gulfstream G550s for the Justice Department’s most powerful players. It’s hard to argue that the head of the FBI or the DOJ shouldn’t have access to a private aircraft, but the use of only the very high-end G550 for nearly all flights, regardless of duration, has been a contentious issue in the past. Although Eric Holder’s trips aboard the DOJ’s Gulfstreams garnered much attention, the mismatch in mission requirements and the aircraft used was also an issue. The Gulfstream 550 is designed to fly internationally , and can reach destinations nearly 7,000 away without refueling. But they are used seemingly for any scope of travel by the DOJ’s head honchos, including regional trips around the eastern half of the US. A smaller aircraft could have offered the same convenience and security, but at a far lower operating cost. One of the DoJ’s G550s landing at BFI in 2011., Andrew W. Sieber/Flickr Commons The GAO study did say that between 2007 and 2011 the FBI’s Citation X was used by both the Attorney General and the head of the FBI, but for just 25 percent of their travel. The Citation X is hardly a conciliation prize nor highly economical, being the fastest business jet in the world, although its smaller cabin is far more pedestrian than that found on a G550. And even the Citation X, which has trans-Atlantic range, can be seen as overkill for shorter trips. GAO Although the heads of the FBI and DOJ use these aircraft for personal trips as well, by directive they must reimburse the government. But that is not at all what it sounds like. Instead of paying their portion of the thousands of dollars it cost to operate a private jet per hour, they pay the equivalent in a coach class airline fare for themselves and non-essential personnel, such as friends and family, who are traveling with them. The GAO report states: As previously noted, OMB Circular A-126 requires that the government be reimbursed for any personal travel at the full coach fare between cities.This reimbursement amount, or equivalent commercial fare, is generally less than the cost of operating a government aircraft. For example, a personal trip taken by the Attorney General to New York in November, 2010 using the FBI’s Gulfstream V had an estimated flight cost of $15,894, but the reimbursement at the equivalent commercial fare was $420.80. The FBI’s flight data showed that the FBI Director took a total of 10 trips aboard FBI aircraft that required reimbursement from fiscal years 2007 through 2011, and he reimbursed the equivalent commercial fare for these flights totaling $4,556 in equivalent commercial cost, while 88 of the Attorney General’s trips required reimbursements during the same time period, and he reimbursed the equivalent commercial fare for these flights totaling $46,982. This may be the most controversial practice of them all, but once again, if these executives have to be able to have secure connectivity at all times, then flying commercial, even on vacation, is not really an option. So is this all really necessary? It probably depends on who you ask, but it really doesn’t seem like it. For the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a small handful of other key officials that would be directly involved with the release of nuclear weapons and other high-end and time-sensitive strategic issues, keeping them connected with secure communications at all times seems like a necessary hindrance. But putting a similar requirement on some agency and department heads seems to be reaching, especially for short trips within the United States. Even then they are not left without access to communications, just secure communications while flying. And it’s not as if they couldn’t land as soon as possible if a major emergency of a highly secure nature were to occur. Additionally, all these people also have deputies to rely on and a chain of command in place that should be able to make decisions if they were temporarily unavailable to do so during transit. GAO In fact, contracting out all of these agencies’ non-sensitive mission and executive travel may be the best way to go. Pushing highly expensive fleets of private aircraft off Uncle Sam’s books and just buying the airtime as it is needed from the commercial market would allow for a much more elastic and flexible operations model. It would also better allow agencies to tailor the aircraft to the executive airlift mission at hand, saving a lot of money in the process. Above all else, it would probably make auditing the aircraft’s use easier and more transparent, and as a result the utilization of government business jets would become less controversial. Just ask Representative Nancy Pelosi’s office how much of a lighting rod the allocation of these assets can become . Take the DOJ’s one-size-fits-all operating practice for instance—a G550 is not needed to travel from Washington DC to, say, Cincinnati, Ohio. A light jet would suffice. For trips across the US, a mid-sized jet would be the right fit. If the government came up with a holistic plan to switch over to charters for this kind of work, efficiency could skyrocket. Not just that, but competition would be fierce to get the government’s business, because it is pretty much the biggest client out there. As such, existing charter services would help drive down the per-hour cost and increase the level of service and dispatch reliability for their government customers. For shorter trips, an aircraft like the CJ3 would be much more economical than a G550. , Cessna-Textron For very long-range missions, and for certain officials, the federal government could utilize approved contractors like Tenax Aerospace, which have aircraft outfitted with secure communications and heavier security measures in place so that all agency business can be conducted in the air. But once again, limiting this to just longer intercontinental flights seems more than sensible than demanding it even for shorter trips within the lower 48 states. In essence, the Federal Government should look at getting out of the executive airlift business by outsource as much of it as possible. And once again, this is not addressing the fleet of DoD aircraft that provide similar capabilities, which including dozens of C-20 and C-37 Gulfstream jets. Most of these flying limousines could be replaced by chartered aircraft. This is especially true when it comes to scooting generals and other DoD high-ups around the US and other permissive locales. One of the USAF’s C-37s with low profile markings. , Peter Bakema/wikicommons Even transport in and out of war zones could be contracted out, with special requirements placed on aircraft used for those purposes, such as requiring them to be equipped with defensive countermeasures suites. Instead, the DoD has to house, maintain, provide pilots for, and eventually replace an exhaustive type list of disparate aircraft that provide these executive transport services in-house. The federal government and the military should examine such a concept. At the very least just studying it and evaluating its worth would be a well warranted reform. Dollars saved could be used by government agencies to fund needed programs and to fill capability gaps and the DoD could use those funds to enhance its war fighting capabilities. The USMC’s UC-35’s represent the lower end of the DoD’s executive airlift business jet fleet. , USMC The chances of any this happening are slim. Although President Trump has made many statements about drastically cutting government spending, especially on frivolous things, the President himself is the biggest individual “user” of government owned airlift assets. Decades before he took to the Oval Office, it became clear that Trump loves to fly. Coming from his own fleet of aircraft that included a 757, a Citation X, and a trio of S-76 helicopters, the 45th President has not throttled back on his weekly trips to his resorts, a reality that has become the center of public controversy and disdain by some in Congress . As such, it is very unlikely the White House would start clipping the wings of other government officials on fiscal grounds. With all this in mind, it is all but certain the next FBI Director will enjoy cruising around in a $55 million high-flying luxury jet just like his predecessor, no matter the destination.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Special Operators Fly Across Moscow Skyline On Tactical Platform Slung Below Mi-8 Helo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There was a flurry of videos and photos coming out of Russia on Friday showing what appeared to be people standing on an octagon-shaped disk-like apparatus that was attached to a Mi-8 helicopter via a long line. The helicopter was accompanied by at least one other Mi-8 as they descended toward the Kremlin. Although helicopters are a constant presence over Moscow, and especially near the Kremlin which has large landing pads that often receive the Mi-8MTIs that ferry President Putin around, as well as far more exotic government choppers , there usually aren’t people performing what appears to be a grand circus act of sorts hanging below them. The reality is that what people actually saw was Russia’s elite counter-terror operators training with a device known in the special operations community as Airborne Tactical Extraction Platform, or AirTEP for short. https://youtube.com/watch?v=40FO5GfBQ6w The AirTEP system is used to rapidly infiltrate and exfiltrate personnel from tight spots where helicopters can’t land. With the right pilot, the platform can be set down quickly even on relatively tiny surfaces. After touching down, the operators onboard quickly disconnect and step off the platform so the helicopter can quickly fly away. The opposite of this operation is used for extraction. There are a number of advantages to this technique over fast roping, using ladders or winches, or the SPIE method when used in certain circumstances. Speed of action is this system’s primary feature and commandos can shoulder their weapons effectively during the terminal stages of a transport operation. Combining tactics, such as using fast roping for insertion and AirTEP for extraction, provides enhanced flexibility for the most challenging mission sets. Capewell Aerial Systems, who sells the AirTEP system, describes its utility as such: The fastest way up and out! The innovative AirTEP Tactical Extraction Platform is ideal for inserting or extracting personnel via helicopter from land or sea environments—including confined areas. AirTEP is ideal for use in natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, forest fires–or any situation where multiple rescues are required concurrently. AirTEP holds up to ten people (3500 lbs). The AirTEP is 9.5 feet in diameter, weighs 110lbs, and is rated for airspeeds up to 100 knots while fully loaded. Escape International , a French firm, appears to be the designer of the system. Capewell Aerial Systems Quite frankly, I have only heard of this system being used by counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and other high-end special operations units, not by search and rescue personnel or for other applications such as delivering workers to an oil platform , but that doesn’t mean it isn’t in service in those roles. Even for tactical uses , these systems aren’t extremely prevalent around the globe. France’s GIGN is maybe the most visible user of the system, as well as Germany’s GSG-9. Jordan’s special operations forces have also been seen using the system before. The SAS and America’s elite counter-terror units also have the system in their inventories supposedly, but it’s unclear if they train with it regularly or not. There are other special operations and counter-terror unit customers, but sometimes unique capabilities like this aren’t really publicized heavily. They may show up in live demonstrations from time to time, though. The system shown in the imagery from Russia could have been previously imported or it could be an indigenous version of the AirTEP that has appeared in a number of photos in the past . Russian special operations and security forces have moved to adopt western tactics and gear in recent years, so the use of this system, whether imported on not, isn’t that surprising. A locally produced AirTEP like system., Englishtorussia.com As for why this was happening, well there may have been some turbulence from within Russia’s intelligence services as of late, but there is no indication that the recent appearance of commandos whizzing over the Russian capital has anything to do with that. Instead, the spectacle was surely part of a training operation that prepares Russian counter-terror teams to quickly respond in a crisis. Clearly, Russia’s top leadership and landmarks that represent the Russian state are the highest-profile targets for terrorists to go after, so training in and around the Kremlin makes a lot of sense. Beyond that, drilling for operations in urban terrain is something that simply can’t be replicated to a high degree of fidelity even in purpose-built training areas . So actually giving helicopter crews and commandos, and everyone who supports their direct action activities, real-life training where the worst of events could come to pass is of extremely high value. Escape International The U.S. is no different than Russia in this regard. This particular assault method may not be that popular among counter-terror units here in the United States, but using helicopters to shuffle around the huge cities and quickly assault targets is. These types of drills occur regularly in metropolitan areas across the U.S. and usually drum up a lot of confusion and misplaced fear in the process. Even training in dense areas for the rapid extraction of the highest ranking officials in the land occurs, from across Washington DC to Midtown Manhattan . Capewell Aerial Systems If anything else, this display offered a little peek into how the Russian security apparatus could respond to a major terrorist act or hostage crisis in Moscow. Regardless, that must be one hell of a rush riding a flying disk through a dense city packed with tall buildings and iconic architecture at 115 miles an hour. Doing it at night must be a whole other thrill altogether.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 7, 2020",Mystery Pirate Patch-Wearing Special Operator Jumped In To Help Kenyans During Hotel Attack,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Kenyan authorities say they have the situation in the country’s capital Nairobi “ under control ” after terrorists attacked an upscale hotel and business complex earlier today. As the chaotic situation evolved, television news footage and pictures spotted what appeared to be at least one western special operator working together with the throngs of local security forces who responded to the incident, which left more than 10 people dead, including one British and one American civilian, and more injured. The attack began at around 3:00 PM local time when a suicide bomber detonated themselves in the foyer of the Dusit D2 Hotel , while a second explosion rocked the parking lot outside. At least four gunmen then began shooting civilians and security forces in the hotel and attached buildings, which include a bank and are frequented by foreigners. More than twelve hours later there were still reports of fighting in the city, despite the statements from the Kenyan government. Al Shabaab , a Somali terrorist group with ties to Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack. Kenya is a major contributor to the African Union Mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ), which is actively supporting that country’s government in its campaign to defeat Al Shabaab and other militants. Jan. 15, 2019 is the three year anniversary of Al Shabaab’s spectacular attack on Kenyan forces in Somalia in the town of El Adde. It remains the deadliest attack on AMISOM forces since that mission began in 2007 and Kenya’s worst military defeat ever. As such, Kenya’s government continues to conceal the full extent of the debacle, which left between 140 and 185 of its soldiers dead and the camp and its weapons and equipment in terrorist hands. A Kenyan security forces member looks at bullet holes in a window during the terrorist attack in Nairobi, Kenya on Jan. 15, 2019., AP Photo/Ben Curtis In September 2013, Al Shabaab fighters launched an earlier complex attack on the Westgate Mall complex , another high-end location in Nairobi, killing more than 70 people and wounding dozens more. The Somali group ultimately claimed responsibility for a string of attacks stretching from 2011 to 2014 . When plainclothes Kenyan police and uniformed security forces elements responded to the latest attack at the Dusit D2 complex, they found themselves in a firefight with the attackers. In addition, members of the press on the scene spotted an individual in plainclothes wearing a balaclava and carrying weapons and other equipment more closely associated with western special operations forces. This included a camouflage-painted AR-15/M16 rifle , or derivative thereof , with a suppressor and other accessories, a drop holster with a Glock pistol , and a Crye Precision Adaptive Vest System and other attached tactical gear. The video and pictures show him working directly with Kenyan security forces, darting back and forth to usher civilians to safety. One picture shows him dramatically carrying a wounded individual with the aid of another person who is either a plainclothes police officer or just an innocent bystander. What’s so interesting is that there is no sign that this individual was part of a larger, similarly equipped team and appears to be acting by himself in conjunction with Kenyan forces. He was not wearing any apparent national or distinctive unit insignia, but the individual did have a very specific patch on the back of his gear emblazoned with a flag motif associated with the infamous pirate Edward “Blackbeard” Teach and his most famous ship, the Queen Anne’s Revenge . The design features a horned skeleton toasting the devil and spearing a heart, with three drops of blood falling from it. This patch has become closely associated with the U.S. Navy SEALs in recent years as some of the teams seemed to have adopted it and Blackbeard’s lore to some degree. Skulls and crossbones , skeletons, the devil, hourglasses, and the just the color black were all common on pirate flags during the 17th and 18th centuries. They were meant to evoke various themes including death, mortality, and the fleeting nature of life itself for both pirates and their victims – Blackbeard was between 35 and 40 years old when he died – according to the Queen Anne’s Revenge Project , part of the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources The various symbols also reflected merciless violence and fearlessness in the face of death. Red colored symbols, symbolizing blood, had similar connotations and close handed grips on spears and other weapons were also meant to signal that pirates would give no quarter to their opponents. All that being said, the flag’s connection to Blackbeard appears to be entirely fabricated , with the only contemporary reference to the pirate’s own banner describing the more common skull and crossbones motif and “bloody flags” with unspecified red symbols. It is very possible that Blackbeard used more than one type of flag, but the first known instance of the toasting skeleton appears in a 1912 article, which also doesn’t draw a connection to him directly. The first known depiction of the flag in question from a 1912 article in Mariner’s Mirror ., via the Queen Anne’s Revenge Project Still, pirate symbology has long been a staple of military units around the globe. You can read a great example of this in this past feature of ours . Navy SEALs, in particular, have adopted all types of classical and pop culture imagery over the years, including pirate flags and skull symbology. Probably most famous is celebrated sniper Chris Kyle’s SEAL unit adopting the insignia of the Marvel anti-hero The Punisher during their tours in Iraq. Of course, the Blackbeard flag patches are also widely available online and do not necessarily point to one unit or another specifically. It’s also quite common for units to adopt symbology from other units they work with, which can lead to international controversy, and exchange morale patches. Once again, maybe the best example of this is the SEAL’s use of the Punisher logo, which has since become a staple of Iraqi forces and other military and police units around the globe. So, even though the Blackbeard patch has been widely associated with the Navy SEALs in recent years, it doesn’t mean this lone mystery operator is a SEAL himself. The United States has a major military presence in Kenya, including conventional and special operations forces, who support various training and advisory missions, as well as supporting Kenyan forces on counter-terrorism missions. However, a Pentagon spokesperson told The War Zone by phone that U.S. Africa Command has only been monitoring the situation in Kenya and would only respond directly after a request from the U.S. State Department. “We are working with the Kenyan authorities to determine if there are any U.S. citizens affected,” a State Department spokesperson said in a subsequent Email. “The U.S. Embassy has actively offered assistance to local authorities,” but they could not say whether or not the Kenyan government had accepted that assistance. It is possible that this individual part of the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service or is in Kenya with an “other government agency,” such as security contractor working for the Central Intelligence Agency . The masked operator was not the only interesting player at the scene. An unmasked foreign security person wearing a vest bearing the word “agent,” had a badge with an eagle motif common to many U.S. law enforcement agencies and American private security companies. Another foreign security forces member during the Nairobi attack, who appears to be a member of U.S. law enforcement agency or a security contractor., AP Photo/Ben Curtis But based on what was visible of his loadout, other observers have suggested he is much more likely to be a member of the United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF), which includes the 22 Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS). He could also be from another British unit, as the British Armed Forces also have a significant conventional and special operations presence in Kenya, including the British Army Training Unit Kenya ( BATUK ). His rifle appears to be similar, if not identical to the L119A2 , a British version of the Colt Canada C8 Special Forces Weapon (SFW). The weapon’s Aimpoint T2 is reportedly another common piece of U.K. special operations kit. Since 2013, Glock 17s have been the standard sidearms in the British Army Forces, where they are known as the L131A1. Whatever the case, it is not uncommon to see foreign special operations forces and other military personnel, especially from western nations, working with local security forces during terrorist attacks that may involve nationals from those countries. Notably, in January 2016, U.S. and French special operations forces – including at least one American with their kit worn over jeans and a t-shirt – worked with their hosts in Burkina Faso to respond to a terrorist attack on a restaurant and a luxury hotel, both of which foreigners frequented, in that country’s capital Ouagadougou. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IIuEAWsDFtc Whoever this individual in Nairobi was and what country and unit he belongs to specifically, he clearly wasted no time in rushing to the aid of Kenyan forces.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",New Video Of B-2 Bomber Dropping Mother Of All Bunker Busters Sends Ominous Message,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The B-2 Spirit is still America’s silver bullet over 20 years after it entered operational service and 30 years since it began its flight test program . Its nuclear capability remains a key component of America’s Nuclear Triad , but its ever-evolving , long-range , deep-penetrating, conventional strike abilities are what has made the Spirit the plane that often goes to work first when America’s armed forces get a 911 call. One of the most important weapons in the B-2’s repertoire is the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP)—the most powerful non-nuclear bunker buster on the planet weighing in at a whopping 33,000 pounds. The B-2 can carry a pair of them. This weapon, paired with the B-2’s ability to sneak deep into enemy territory, give the United States the ability to destroy the most fortified and high-value bunkers on earth. This is the weapon that will be put to work on the very first moments of a U.S. air campaign in North Korea or Iran. It is a highly unique capability that no other air arm of on earth possesses. In the past, we have seen some lower quality video of a B-2 dropping a MOP for testing, but now the USAF has posted a very high-quality video of a recent test showing two of the giant weapons being employed near-simultaneously. And it is something to behold: One has to be suspicious of the timing of the release of this video,—which came with no detailed description—as tensions are ratcheting up between the U.S. and both Iran and North Korea . The MOP is precision guided primarily using GPS, similar to the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). Yet even the bunker buster variants in that series of weapons are incomparable to the mighty MOP. This precision guidance is thought to allow the MOP to not only hit deeply-buried installations at their weakest points, but it offers the potential to ‘layer-in’ multiple MOPs on a single pinpoint location—in effect ‘digging’ down to where the soil, rock, and concrete end and the vital infrastructure begins. The Air Force is fully aware of how important this weapon is, even against a peer state like China that has gone as far as constructing a massive submarine base inside a mountain, and the service is ordering new and improved versions of the MOP that you can and should read all about in this past highly-detailed article of ours. The crystal-clear video of not one, but two MOPs being employed against a ground target certainly sends the clear message to America’s potential foes that it has the ability to reach out and touch even the most hardened, well defended, and far-flung of facilities without going nuclear. If the video got our attention, it surely got the adversary’s as well. Think of it as a friendly reminder of just what’s at stake when it comes to going to war with the United States military. Above all else, it pretty much underlines the fact that a decapitation strike is possible even if the top regime members being targeted are hiding out in places meant to be immune from enemy bombardment. It’s a sobering reality, to say the least.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The situation is very fluid and details remain scarce at best, but multiple reports state that an F-16 has crashed near March Air Reserve Base located just outside of Riverside, California. The aircraft supposedly careened into a warehouse resulting in a substantial fire. Firefighters have requested a full hazmat response. Some are saying this indicates the aircraft was carrying live munitions, which could very well be true, but F-16s also use the volatile fuel hydrazine for power generation and the planes themselves contain materials that could be harmful to personnel when set alight. Some reports have also stated that the pilot ejected and landed safely, although they are yet to be officially confirmed. March ARB is home to a remote alert site for fighters tasked with the air defense of the United States, and more specifically, the airspace over and around Southern California. Although the California Air National Guard 144th Fighter Wing, which is based in Fresno, has supported the mission there in the past, the in recent years, F-16s from out of state Air Guard units have provided aircraft and crews for the mission. Most notably, F-16s from the 114th Fighter Wing of the South Dakota Air National Guard have often satisfied this tasking. The base also supports transient military aircraft and those in the region for exercises and training and houses an Air Mobility Command wing of C-17s and KC-135s, and an Air National Guard MQ-9 Reaper drone squadron, among other smaller residents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2019",Russia Now Claims It Will Buy 76 Su-57 Advanced Fighter Jets By 2028,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Less than a year after the Kremlin publicly announced that it would be deferring large-scale production of the Su-57 advanced fighter jet indefinitely, President Vladimir Putin has announced plans to buy 76 of the aircraft through 2028. The purchase order has an estimated value of more than $2.6 billion, which would make it the single largest aviation contract in Russian Air Force history, but is also a questionably low figure. Significant questions also remain as to how capable of the new planes will be, given that the first batches will still use underperforming engines , and whether Russia has the resources to keep everything on schedule at all. Putin revealed that the large order of Su-57s would be included in the country’s next upcoming armament procurement plan during a meeting on May 15, 2019 . The day before, six of the jets, approximately half of the flyable examples of the type that Russia has now, had escorted the Russian President as he flew to visit the Russian Air Force’s 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center. The Kremlin does have another dozen of the jets on order and had previously expected to buy just 16 more by 2028. The Russian President said that a 20 percent reduction in unspecified costs allowed for this significant increase. On May 16, 2019, the Kommersant newspaper in Russia reported, citing an unnamed defense industry source, that this was the result of an unexplained change in the aircraft’s internal layout, as well as improvements to the production process due to lessons learned with the beginning of limited serial production. In addition, the Russian government has capped the profit margin for defense procurement programs at between three and five percent. Kommersant ’s source was quick to note that while this limited the profitability of the contract, the deal would ensure that United Aircraft Corporation’s (UAC) Komsomolsk-on-Amur production line would be working at or near full capacity for the next decade. UAC is a state-owned enterprise that includes the Sukhoi company. Komsomolsk-on-Amur, situated in Russia’s Far East region, is also responsible for the production of other Sukhoi fighter jets, including the latest model of the popular Flanker family, the Su-35 Flanker-E . Though Putin has announced the planned purchases, the Kremlin has yet to sign a formal contract. This official agreement could easily come at Russia’s annual MAKS airshow, which is set to run from Aug. 27 to Sept. 1, 2019, at the Zhukovsky International Airport outside Moscow. The full estimated cost, around $2.63 billion, also includes additional associated items, including infrastructure upgrades, to support the new aircraft. But there are serious questions up front about how realistic this price tag is. If the $2.63 billion cost is accurate and covers the 76 Su-57s and more, this would equate to a unit price of less than $34 million per jet. This is less than the estimated unit cost of the Su-30MKK Flankers Russia sold to China nearly two decades ago. It seems hard to see how any production line improvements or changes to the aircraft’s configuration could lead to such a dramatic price reduction and anywhere near that low of unit price overall. On top of that, Putin seemed to suggest in his comments at the meeting that the cost reductions would make the order for 76 Su-57 no more expensive than the previously planned purchase of just 16 aircraft. It is very difficult to see how it could be possible to buy nearly five times as many planes for the same price with just a 20 percent decrease in costs. One of the pre-production Su-57s., UAC It seems more likely that the $2.63 billion would be for an initial batch of Su-57s as part of the full planned procurement program. It is also possible that Kommersant ‘s source simply had incorrect information about the total cost. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov, seemingly aware of how improbable Putin’s own comments sounded, subsequently said that the President had merely meant that the overall defense budget would not change, but that it could be necessary to reallocate funds to the Su-57 program to pay for the increased purchases. “This is not about a simple mathematical formula, it’s about the fact that, in general, the budget of the Ministry [of defense], the procurement budget will not increase, but some internal redistribution is, of course, possible and permissible,” he noted . But beyond questions about the actual cost of the aircraft, there are is also the matter of the aircraft’s actual capabilities. The development of suitable engines for jets has been a particularly persistent issue since the program began in the late 2000s. Sukhoi originally planned to use an advanced derivative of the Saturn AL-31F engine , found on its Flankers, for the Su-57. The advanced fighter jet would have two of these new AL-41F-1 engines. It has since become apparent that these engines do not meet the performance targets the Kremlin has outlined for the Su-57. Saturn is already working on a new, more powerful design, known as the Izdeliye 30 , or “Product 30.” A briefing slide from Saturn and its partners showing the progression of the AL-31/AL-41F design leading to the Product 30 engine at the far right., NPO Saturn The problem is that the Product 30 has run into its own developmental issues, as well as questions about the overall quality control at Saturn, and the company now does not expect to be able to begin mass producing the engine until some time in the 2020s. Kommersant ’s source also made it clear that the first batches of Su-57s that the Russian Air Force will receive will still have the AL-41F-1 engines. This can only limit the capability of the initial production Su-57s and could lead to additional costs for Russia down the road in order to refit these aircraft with Product 30 engines. The video below shows a flight test of a pre-production Su-57 with on AL-41F-1 and one Izdeliye 30. There are also no specific details available yet about whether or not the changes to the jet’s internal configuration to keep costs down have had an impact on its advertised capabilities. The War Zone has previously examined the Su-57’s reported and often misunderstood design features, and the capabilities they offer, in depth . The Russians already appear to be moving toward pairing the Su-57 with advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) in the future, which would help offset some of its existing limitations. A picture of a pre-production Su-57 emerged earlier this year showing markings that suggested the aircraft could be acting as a UCAV surrogate or as a platform for evaluating future manned-unmanned teaming concepts. Sukhoi itself is actively pursuing the development of advanced unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV), with pictures appearing online just earlier this year of the S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV prototype. The Russians may have decided that these future operational concepts also outright obviated the need for certain existing or planned features on the Su-57, at least in the near term. A picture of the S-70 Okhotnik-B prototype., Russian social media On top of all of this remains the ever-present question about whether or not Russia will be able to afford the increased purchases of Su-57s in context of other defense priorities, especially a significant number of new strategic nuclear weapon systems , or at all, no matter what the final configuration or price point is. The official statements from Russian officials in 2018 about deferring production of the advanced fighter jets in favor of the latest models of existing fourth-generation types, such as the Flanker-E, indicated that cost was the driving factor. The Kremlin has similarly decided to curtail production of its new T-14 Armata tank , another high-priced procurement program, and focus instead on major upgrades to its existing fleets. It’s also worth remembering that even if the all of Su-57 purchases Russia has planned now go ahead, the Russian Air Force will have around 100 examples of the type by the end of the next decade, including the pre-production jets. The Kremlin previously planned to have 150 of these aircraft in service by 2020. Another one of Russia’s existing pre-production Su-57s., UAC It is also possible that the Kremlin and UAC are, at least in part, betting heavily on finding new international customers for the Su-57 in the near future. This could help spread out the cost burdens and also support the development of future upgrades, such the Product 30 engines, and new weapons . Just recently, Russia notably made a very public offer of the jets to Turkey recently as an option for that country should the United States expel it from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program over planned purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system . There are also reports that Russia is courting China as another potential buyer. India had been a partner in the Su-57 program, but reportedly gave up on the project last year, saying the design no longer met their particular requirements. The Indians have developed particularly close ties to the United States in recent years and there have been a series of reports that the country is looking to eventually join the F-35 program. Putin’s announcement of the Kremlin’s plans to reinvigorate the Su-57 program and significantly increase the planned purchases of the aircraft for the Russian Air Force is well in line with a broader strategy to promote the sale of the planes abroad. It can only serve as a signal to prospective foreign buyers that the program is successfully managing risks and is finally on its way out of development purgatory. Between Putin’s announcement and his arrival at the Cahkalov State Flight-Test Center flanked by Su-57s, there is clearly renewed interest in the aircraft and in acquiring more of them within the Kremlin, at least. Whether or not Russia will be able to acquire as many of the jets as it wants or whether they will be as capable as advertised remains to be seen.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 22, 2019",Watch This Ultra Rare Cockpit Video Of An F-22 Raptor Blasting Through The Skies,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Air Force F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team has released a video showing rare in-cockpit video of the stealth jet tearing through the skies. Images, let alone video, taken of or inside the F-22’s cockpit have been highly restricted since the F-22A took its first flight over 20 years ago. This is especially true when it comes to its control panel, although a couple of photos do exist . While you can find piles of exciting GoPro-like clips taken inside the cockpits of nearly all tactical jets , similar clips featuring F-22s are far less common. Even Hollywood productions featuring A-list casts haven’t gotten the green light to feature any internal angles of the F-22’s cockpit. Now that is clearly changing and soon the Air Force’s other stealth fighter demonstration team will also be joining the Raptor team when it comes to in-cockpit movie making magic. The video was published on May 16th, 2019, by the team. It shows F-22 demo pilot Major Paul “Loco” Lopez putting the Raptor through a handful of air show maneuvers, most of which are the more traditional sequences in the routine. Still, the view is largely alien to those of us who have watched many cockpit video clips. The F-22’s massive control surfaces are clearly visible fluttering away in the incredible view backward out of the jet’s frameless bubble canopy. The video below the team’s latest release shows a similar view taken in 2011. It features more the F-22’s routine, but is of less quality. The F-35 Demo Team, which features a new, highly-energized routine for this air show season, has teased its own cockpit video with a few short clips. It has a wider view than the Raptor video and uses 360′ video capture technology for some awesome shifting perspectives. Most interestingly, you can see the F-35’s stick and throttle ‘inceptors’ in the video and the pilot manipulating them through a few maneuvers. That video has yet to be released in full, but we will be sure to post it when it is. View this post on Instagram A post shared by F-35A Lightning II Demo Team (@f35demoteam) The Air Force seems to be loosening up a bit overall when it comes to showing the cockpits of its most sensitive combat aircraft. Just recently, a video of the B-2 Spirit’s cockpit, also taken in flight, was released for the first time. A very limited number of pictures of the stealth bomber’s cockpit do exist showing its modern configuration , but none that offer such detail and show everything powered up and functioning during flight. Our friend David Cenciotti did a nice breakdown of what he saw in that video. The only thing we can add at first glance is the windscreen frame can be seen where a special glass panel can be installed for nuclear missions. Once activated, this glass pane can go opaque in an instant when a flash from the detonation of a nuclear device is detected, thus saving the crew’s eyesight without the need for having them wear cumbersome goggles that provide a similar function. You can read more about this technology in this past piece of ours . It’s somewhat puzzling that in a time marked by the Pentagon giving out less information to the public on its most potent capabilities and technologies, the approval for in-cockpit videos of aircraft that were previously off limits is a becoming a real trend.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 27, 2020",Behold An MC-130J Spec Ops Transport With Its Badly Needed Terrain Following Radar Installed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has released a video showing one of the first MC-130J Commando II special operations transports equipped with the Raytheon AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar. The U.S. Air Force plans to upgrade the entire Commando II fleet to this new configuration in the coming years, giving the planes a nap-of-the-earth flight capability that is essential for performing their special operations missions, but which they have lacked since their introduction nearly a decade ago. By the end of 2018, the Air Force had at least two MC-130Js equipped with the Silent Knight Radar, or SKR, according to Pentagon budget documents . In its most recent budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which is in charge of procuring SKRs for Air Force Special Operations Command, asked for almost $9 million for the purchase of two radars, associated equipment, and support services. AFSOC expects to eventually receive more than 70 Commando IIs, all of which are set to receive the new radar. “The program will not just integrate that new radar, but will also evolve the [MC-130J’s] digital cockpit to automate essential functions,” Paul Keith, Lockheed Martin’s Program Manager for the MC-130J Common Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance Radar (MCTF) program, said in the new video. “This will allow a smaller AFSOC crew to do as much or even more than current crews can do.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=NNFz-nIvMcM SKR is an impressive multi-function radar in its own right, with terrain-following/terrain avoidance, weather, and ground mapping modes. It works over any terrain, including sand, ice, and snow, as well as in maritime environments. SOCOM’s requirements called for it to work at altitudes from 100 to 1,000 feet in level or turning flight and at speeds from 5 to 300 knots, or between 6 and 345 miles per hour. A screengrab from the video showing one of the MC-130Js now equipped with the SKR., Lockheed Martin capture The radar operates on K-band and has low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) features. This is an important consideration for special operations missions that often involve penetrating into denied areas. If the enemy detected the radar passively in or near their airspace it could give away the MC-130J’s presence and compromise its mission and its survivability. The terrain-follow and terrain avoidance capability in of itself helps enable extremely low nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, including in poor weather and at night, to help evade and avoid hostile air defenses. SOCOM initially began the SKR program in the late 2000s primarily to develop a new terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar for the special operations MH-47 Chinooks and MH-60 Black Hawks assigned to the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment . Since then, however, the effort has evolved, with plans now for the radar to become a common system for those helicopters, as well as the Air Force’s special operations CV-22B Osprey tilt-rotors and the MC-130J. An overview of the SKR’s features., SOCOM Silent Knight offers significant benefits for each one of these platforms, but is a particularly essential development for the Commando II. AFSOC’s MC-130 fleets as a whole, which also includes the MC-130H Combat Talon II , are facing increasing challenges as ever-improving threat air defense capabilities continue to emerge and proliferate around the world . For decades now, AFSOC and other components of the Air Force have been investigating a wide array of potentially more survivable replacement options, including stealth transport aircraft, as well as myriad upgrades to ensure the MC-130 platform remains relevant in the coming years. The War Zone recently completed a large two-part feature on these developments, which you can find here and here . In the meantime, terrain-following and terrain avoidance capabilities and nap-of-the-earth flight profiles remain critical to the ability of MC-130s to complete their missions. So, shockingly, the Air Force took delivery of the first MC-130Js in 2011, and put the first examples into operational service the next year, without any such capability. After nearly a decade, with the exception of the examples now carrying the SKR, the Commando II fleet still lacks the kind of functionality found on the older MC-130H. An MC-130H Combat Talon II. That large nose radome contains, among other things, the aircraft’s AN/APQ-170 terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar., Carlos Menendez San Juan via Wikimedia “Concerning the MC-130H Combat Talon II, these would remain in service longer, the first retirements not planned until FY15 (two), with another three in FY19,” according to an official AFSOC history for the 2013 calendar year, which the author previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. “The main reason for retaining the H models longer centered on their capabilities, specifically terrain following radar and self-protection features.” It’s worth noting that the MC-130J has already replaced the MC-130P Combat Shadow , which served primarily as a special operations tanker for helicopters such as the 160th’s MH-47s and MH-60s, rather than as a platform to deeply penetrate into denied areas to insert, extract, or resupply special operations forces. This helps explain why the Air Force had originally named the J model as the Combat Shadow II, before renaming it the Commando II. You can find the full story behind the MC-130J’s name here . In Lockheed Martin’s new video, they refer to the SKR-equipped aircraft as Combat Talon IIIs, a moniker the Air Force officially rejected, but which may become an informal name for the aircraft, something that often happens with U.S. military aircraft. Whatever the case, AFSOC only formalized requirements to add a terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar to the MC-130J in 2012 and installed a prototype system on one aircraft, serial number 09-5713, the following year. This was an update to Northrop Grumman’s AN/APN-241 multi-function radar, a design first introduced in the 1990s that is found on standard C-130J Hercules airlifters. A look at some of the different modes and functionality that the AN/APN-241 offers., Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman and Israel’s Elbit systems developed the update , which is now part of the standard AN/APN-241 package and offers a certain level of terrain-following/terrain avoidance capability. However, the modified radar turned out to be unsuitable for highly demanding low-level special operations missions. “The committee understands that during contractor flight tests of the APN-241 modified for terrain following, operators and testers deemed the APN-241 unsafe and ineffective for Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) flight, and that any modification to the current APN-241 would require extensive redesign and result in a new radar system,” a report from the House Armed Services Committee in 2015 explained. “As such, the committee supports the USSOCOM Commander’s decision to accelerate transition to the AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight Radar program.” It is important to note that the AN/APQ-187 won’t replace the AN/APN-241 on the Commando II. “Unknowns consisted or potential radar signal interference, system integration, and mounting/weight unknowns,” AFSOC had already warned with regards to this dual radar configuration in 2013. We don’t know what measures Lockheed Martin or Raytheon may have taken to mitigate these concerns or what limitations this might impose on the SKR’s functionality. A look at an MC-130J equipped with the SKR with its main nose radome removed. The AN/APN-241 is visible directly below the SKR., Lockheed Martin capture Regardless, it’s clear that the SKR is far better suited to the MC-130J’s special operations mission than the existing AN/APN-241. Hopefully, with SOCOM having now transitioned from development to actually procuring conversion kits, it will not be long before the entire existing Commando II fleet receives their new distinctive noses. Until they get this desperately needed terrain-following/terrain avoidance capability, the MC-130Js will remain limited in the kinds of missions they can perform and where and when they can perform them.

On May 31, 2018, the Army’s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland announced that it had finalized the contract, worth nearly $1.5 million, with Clear Sky Aviation, LLC of Tucson, Arizona via the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps . Under the terms of the deal, the company will fly the Ex- Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 777-268ER jet, which has tail number HZ-AKF, from that country’s capital Riyadh to Phillips Airfield at Aberdeen. The firm is also supplying four cargo sections from scrapped Boeing 747 jumbo jet airliners for additional destructive testing. The “Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) is required to acquire and conduct commercial aircraft vulnerability testing in accordance with their interagency agreement … with [the] U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS),” an earlier contracting document explained. “ATC intends to use the aircraft solely for destructive testing purposes and agrees that it will not allow the aircraft, nor any of its component parts , to be used on any other aircraft by any party.” HZ-AKF looks to have been a good candidate for the Army’s needs. It rolled off Boeing’s production line in 1998 and has flown almost 34,800 flight hours already. The jet has been sitting in storage in Riyadh since August 2017. The video below shows HZ-AKF landing in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2017, just months before Saudi Arabian Airlines pulled it out of service. In their quote, Clear Sky Aviation noted they were in the process of acquiring other 777s that might have had even higher flight hours and that it could substitute one of those for HZ-AKF if the Army was amendable. We don’t know whether or not ATC chose to accept an alternative airframe. The original requirements called for a 777 of any subseries in a passenger configuration that ATC could pressurize to a representative level on the ground during the tests. The original request for proposals makes clear that airworthiness was not their primary concern. For example, the aircraft only had to have “the complete landing gear assemblies or suitable replacement which could consist of time-expired landing gear components or fabricated steel components that would be able to safely support the aircraft and not hinder the aircraft from being repositioned to a specific location on a test pad as needed,” according to the initial contracting notice. “Timber shoring or cradles will not be an acceptable means of support.” Interior shots of HZ-AKF that Clear Sky Aviation supplied with their bid., Clear Sky Aviation via US Army After getting HZ-AKF to Maryland, Clear Sky Aviation has a month to rip out anything it hasn’t agreed to sell to the Army and might want to keep for itself. The company says it will retain the aircraft’s two engines, the auxiliary power units, and other components. Here’s a full breakdown of what the company offered the Army: A list of what Clear Sky Aviation said it would include in its delivery of HZ-AKF to the Army., Clear Sky Aviation via US Army The idea of buying an entire plane just to destroy it might seem odd, but this kind of full-scale physical testing is an important part of exploring a commercial aircraft’s vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. We don’t know what ATC has in store for HZ-AKF specifically, but it is very likely so-called “ Least Risk Bomb Location ” (LRBL) testing. These experiments are intended to determine the where the crew of an airliner can chuck a bomb if they find one and have the best chance of mitigating the explosion. Since 1972, the FAA has maintained established LRBL rules that aircraft makers can voluntarily submit to when they design an aircraft. There’s no testing requirement, though, so DHS, with the help of the Army, routinely does it themselves to examine whether the specific features hold up. Phillips Airfield at Aberdeen., Google Earth What appears to be a Boeing 757 parked at Phillips Airfield., Google Earth Aberdeen could easily use the aircraft for additional destructive testing, as well, and the data obtained from the LRBL experiments would likely be applicable more broadly. For nearly as long as there have been airplanes, there have been criminals and terrorists eager to hijack or sabotage them for various reasons. In 1933, in what is accepted as the first incident of its kind, a United Airlines Boeing 247 crashed after a bomb exploded on board. The case remains unsolved, but the prevailing theory it was a mob hit. Airline hijackings and bombings surged in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the most notable attacks was the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988. Then-Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi is understood to have ordered the bombing, likely in retaliation for the U.S. military’s strikes on his country in 1986 during Operation El Dorado Canyon . https://youtube.com/watch?v=Odf7DUAd6M8 As such, full, destructive testing has only become increasingly valuable as a means to let investigators, engineers, and scientists see firsthand what sort of damage results from different types of explosives going off in different portions of the plane. At the same time, the data can be useful for training individuals to spot certain telltale signs that point to a bombing rather than some sort of accidental malfunction. In many ways, the explosive destructive testing is also similar to other fatigue and environmental torture testing , which also look to stress an airframe to discover potential vulnerabilities before they become a more serious problem. Some of that same data from Aberdeen might help uncover potential weaknesses in various aircraft types to other kinds of possibly catastrophic failures. There’s a continual need to test more aircraft as new threats emerge, as well. A plot in 2006 to use liquid explosives to bring down airplanes fundamentally changed airport security procedures. In 2015, ISIS terrorists claimed they had brought down a Russian airliner over Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula using a bomb hidden inside a soda can . Pre-existing data might not have been applicable in determining the exact danger that either these types of devices posed to commercial flights. More recently, Boeing’s 787 suffered a number of problems with its lithium-ion batteries , which led to a number of serious fires and exposed the potential danger from any device using one. Civil aviation authorities have since continued to explore the impacts of these power sources experiencing a “ thermal runaway ” and either bursting into flames or exploding. In 2017, the FAA went as far as to propose a ban on laptops in checked baggage as result. There’s also just normal wear and tear and other hazards. The engine on a Southwest Airlines 737 exploded in mid-air in April 2018, which led to the death of one of the passengers. Bird strikes can also have serious consequences, especially if they impact a jet’s engines . So, for decades, various U.S. government agencies have carried out representative explosive testing on retired airliners for forensic and other purposes. In 1984, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) joined forces to deliberately crash a remotely-piloted Boeing 720 at Edwards Air Force Base to study the result of the impact on the airframe and simulated occupants. Authorities in other countries have done the same. In 2015, the United Kingdom’s Civil Aviation Authority and the FAA worked together to blow up a retired Air France Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome north of London. Three years earlier, the Discovery Channel paid to smash a remote-controlled Boeing 727 into the desert near Mexicali, Mexico. Similar to the FAA-NASA test in 1984, researchers filmed the impact from the exterior and interior and turned the event into a television special . Private companies have also used destructive testing to explore potential ways to mitigate or defeat terrorist bombs on airliners. In 2015, a European consortium led by a U.K.-based company called Blastech blew apart cargo holds from an Airbus 321 and a Boeing 747 to test prototypes of a system called Fly-Bag , intended to contain the explosion within the compartment to keep a plane aloft and the crew and passengers safe. We don’t know exactly how long ATC’s own effort has been going on, but in 2012 the Army put out a similar contract to buy a single Embraer ERJ-145 regional jetliner for destructive testing. The next year, pictures showed portions of an Airbus A300 and Boeing 737 , 757 , and 767 aircraft sitting at Phillips, according to a story from Aviation Week . In August 2013, the Army put the ex-China Airlines A300 hulk up for sale to make room for another jet. Clear Sky Aviation, which has a nearly non-existent web presence, was also able to sweeten its proposal by noting that it has delivered aircraft to the Army for these purposes in the past. The company said it had flown at least one Airbus A300, as well as a Boeing 757 and 767 types – the ones seen in the 2013 images, to Aberdeen for previous experiments. https://youtube.com/watch?v=RADMTlptWUI According to the final contract, HZ-AKF is supposed to touch down at Aberdeen in November 2018, but we don’t know when the actual tests might occur. But if anyone spots the jet flying in, they might be seeing it for the very last time!

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. State Department has told all non-essential personnel to leave Iraq based on still largely unspecified intelligence showing that Iran and its proxies could be preparing to attack American interests in the country and elsewhere across The Middle East. This comes as more evidence has emerged that the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as other European allies, are in disagreement about the exact extent and nature of these threats. There are also growing calls from members of Congress for greater clarity about the Administration’s claims. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ordered the withdrawal early on May 15, 2019 . The U.S. Embassy in Iraq subsequently said that it had confidence that Iraqi security forces could provide protection, but said that the nature of the apparent threats still made it too risky for non-essential personnel to remain in place. Pompeo had made a surprise visit to Iraq to discuss the situation with officials from that country on May 7, 2019, and, less than a week later, the American Embassy issued a travel warning advising American nationals to stay away. “We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran,” Pompeo had said on May 14, 2019, after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Russia. “We have also made clear to the Iranians that if American interests are attacked, we will most certainly respond in an appropriate fashion.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on May 14, 2019., Ekaterina Lyzlova / Sputnik via AP Tensions between the United States and Iran have been building at an extremely fast pace since May 6, 2019 , when U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton first announced the deployment of B-52 bombers and the expedited movement of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her associated strike group to the Persian Gulf in response to intelligence showing Iran and Iranian backed forces might be positioning themselves for an attack on American interests, or those of its allies, in the region.Â To date, various U.S. government officials and members of Congress have described these threats as “ clear ” and “ imminent ,” but there remains virtually no publicly available evidence to support these claims. On May 13, 2019, the United States reportedly made an initial assessment that four oil tankers that had suffered damage off the coast of the United Arab Emirates had been victims of Iranian or Iranian-supported sabotage attacks, but again, provided no specifics on how they arrived at that conclusion.Â A picture of the Norwegian-flagged oil tanker Andrea Victory, which sustained damage in a reported “sabotage” attack off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on May 13, 2019., Government of the UAE The next day, British Army Major General Christopher Ghika, presently deputy commander of the American-led coalition that continues to battle ISIS in Iraq and Syria, offered a dramatically different take. He told reporters via videolink from Baghdad that there was no increase in the threat from Iranian-backed forces in either of those countries and seemed to suggest that there had been no change in the force protection posture for coalition personnel. “No, thereâ€™s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria,” Ghika said. “Weâ€™re aware of that presence [Iranian-backed militias], clearly. And we monitor them along with a whole range of others because thatâ€™s the environment weâ€™re in. We are monitoring the Shia militia groups. I think youâ€™re referring to carefully and if the threat level seems to go up then weâ€™ll raise our force protection measures accordingly.” Yesterday during an Operation Inherent Resolve briefing, British Army Maj. Gen. Ghika told reporters at the Pentagon, ""We've seen no change in their posture since the recent exchange between the United States and Iran."" https://t.co/x0DY9blM4B pic.twitter.com/7m36ofuk8q — Jake Godin (@JakeGodin) May 15, 2019 A spokesman for U.S. Central Command was quick to contradict Ghika. “OIR [Operation Inherent Resolve] is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to U.S. forces in Iraq,” U.S. Navy Captain Bill Urban said in a statement . WOW. Never seen this before. Following today's briefing where the UK's deputy commander of Inherent Resolve said he did not see increased threats from Iran, U.S. Central Command just put out this statement saying that ""runs counter"" to what the Pentagon sees. pic.twitter.com/aJnbP75JNM — Aaron Mehta (@AaronMehta) May 14, 2019 The U.K. Ministry of Defense has since issued its own response, which notably does not say that Ghika misspoke, but does seem to imply that he might not have a complete picture of regional threats. The statement also does not say whether or not the U.K. government shares the U.S. assessment that there are any increased threats from Iran or Iranian proxies. The United Kingdom, as well as other European countries, had already appeared largely unconvinced by the information they had received from Secretary Pompeo during a short-notice meeting with them in Brussels on the growing tensions with Iran on May 13, 2019 . Ghika “made clear in his Pentagon briefing that ‘there are a range of threats to American and coalition forces in this part of the world. There always have been, that is why we have a very robust range of force protection measures,'” the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in its statement on May 15, 2019. “The U.K. has long been clear about our concerns over Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region.” MOD statement following Major General Chris Ghika's Pentagon press briefing.

German authorities, however, specifically said that they had seen no indications themselves about any potential imminent threats from Iranian or Iranian-backed forces and that their training activities could resume as normal within days, according to Reuters . Two days earlier , Spain also announced that the Â Ãlvaro de BazÃ¡n -class frigate ESPS MÃ©ndez NÃºÃ±ez , which had been sailing with the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, would not accompany those ships into the Persian Gulf. Spanish authorities have been insistent that this is a purely “technical” decision based on the U.S. government’s decision to alter Lincoln ‘s deployment schedule and say the ship will rejoin the carrier when it exits the Gulf. However, there have been reports citing unnamed officials that Madrid was worried about getting caught up in a potential conflict between the United States and Iran. None of this is to say that Iran and its proxies do not pose a potential threat to American interests in the region or that those same forces have not attacked U.S. personnel and those of its allies over the years. Just on May 14, 2019, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked oil facilities in neighboring Saudi Arabia using Qasef-1 suicide drones, a weapon system that you can read about more here . The Houthis have either obtained these unmanned aircraft straight from Iranian sources or have built them using parts they have received from Iran. The attacks prompted the Saudis to stop the flow of oil through its main cross-country pipeline, but regular operations have now resumed . Artwork of a Qasef-1 suicide drone, marked “Qasif,” that Houthi-controlled Al Masirah television broadcast after the strikes on Saudi Arabia on May 14, 2019., Al Masirah capture Tensions between the United States and Iran have also been very visibly growing over the former’s decision to withdraw from the controversial deal over Iran’s nuclear program, which has subsequently imperiled that international agreement and led to Iranian threats to restart uranium enrichment efforts that could put it closer to being able to produce a nuclear weapon , despite Tehran’s insistence that it is not interested in or planning to do so. The U.S. Â government has also now adopted a position of “maximum pressure” against the Iranian regime with all-new sanctions and a decision to designate the country’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group . Iran responded by declaring all U.S. forces in the Middle East to be terrorists, though that act appears to have been almost entirely symbolic. But the question remains as to whether any movements the U.S. or its allies have observed Iran or its proxies making in the region reflect an increased threat or a particularly imminent one to U.S. military forces or American nationals. Despite reports suggesting that the latest Houthi attack showed a “ new level of sophistication ,” the Houthis have been using the Qasef-1 since at least 2017 and employed them in attacks on targets inside Saudi Arabia for what appeared to be the first time more than a year ago .Â Beyond that, Saudi Arabia is in the midst of an active and brutal conflict with the Houthis, which have seen the rebels also short-range ballistic missiles that they apparently obtained from Iran or fabricated with Iranian assistance at Saudi Arabia’s capital , Riyadh. In addition, since the weekend, the Houthis have been withdrawing from a number of port cities as planned in accordance with a U.N.-brokered peace deal. Without any additional information, it is similarly difficult to assess the claims of increased threats to Americans in Iraq, especially, as compared to long-standing security concerns in that country. In September 2018, in the middle of protests in the city of Basra against the government in Baghdad, there were small scale rocket attacks against both the U.S. Embassy and the American consulate in Basra. The U.S. government blamed those incidents on Iranian-backed militias, as well, and shuttered the Basra Consulate.Â Iraqi police face off against protesters in Basra, Iraq, in July 2018., AP All told, the narrative over what exactly the situation is regarding threats from Iran has only grown more confusing and conflicting over the past week or so, and this has even extended to statements from anonymous sources. Unnamed U.S. military officials described the intelligence the United States had received as “sobering and say they believe that Iran is actively planning attacks on U.S. forces,” according to a story from The Washington Post on May 14, 2019. But that same day, The New York Times reported another unnamed U.S. government official as saying the potential threats were “‘small stuff’ and did not merit the military planning being driven by Mr. Bolton.” Bolton had reportedly ordered a review of U.S. military contingency plans regarding Iran last week, with at least one option involving the deployment of a force of 120,000 U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support a series of “bloody nose” stand-off air and missile strikes against Iranian targets. Those same forces could also potentially provide an advance echelon ahead of an actual ground intervention into Iran.Â President Donald Trump has notably dismissed these reports as “fake news” and offered a diplomatic olive branch to Iran earlier in the week, which Iranian officials promptly rejected. He has also implied that the United States could respond forcefully to any Iranian provocations. “Now, would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that,” Trump told reporters on May 14, 2019 , when asked about the possibility that he could possibly send the force of 120,000 personnel to the Middle East. “Hopefully we’re not going to have to plan for that. And if we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.” Trump on reports of sending 120,000 troops to the Middle East. ""I think it's fake news. OK? Now would I do that? Absolutely.

Senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, Republicans from Arkansas and Florida respectively, have publicly advocated for a forceful response to any Iranian threats in recent days . “There have been a number of credible threats from Iran, and we’ve got to be prepared to protect our people,” Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said after leaving a classified briefing for a small number of Senators on the decision to pull non-essential diplomatic staff from Iraq.

Others, including independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have accused the Trump Administration of inflating or misrepresenting the nature of the threats. “There’s an alarming lack of clarity here. There’s a lack of strategy and there’s a lack of consultation,” Schumer told reporters on May 15, 2019. “The president ought to come up with a strategy and make it clear to Congress.” â€œWe still do not have that scheduled. They still havenâ€™t given us a schedule,â€ Pelosi said that same day , referring to reported requests made eight days ago for a classified briefing open to all members of the House of Representatives on the situation regarding Iran. “In many ways they are trying to deter us from having our role,â€ she added. The Trump Administration now says it will provide this broader briefing tomorrow. For the moment, though, the Trump Administration certainly hasn’t begun deploying anywhere near even 120,000 personnel to the Middle East in response to the reported increased threats from Iran. But at the same time, the drumbeats of war are certainly growing, despite a general lack of information, and there is only a growing risk that any miscalculation on either side could turn into a major conflict. UPDATE: 4:00pm ESTâ€” U.S. State Department officials speaking on the condition of anonymity have said that the decision to pull non-essential personnel out of Iraq was based on indications of “multiple threat streams directly linked to Iran” and “increased intelligence reporting” since Secretary Pompeo’s visit to the country last week. However, those same individuals reportedly stressed that this did not mean the threats were any more credible or imminent than they had been previously. There is still essentially no details about what the threats themselves, which have now been “imminent” for more than a week.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 11, 2019","The U.S. State Department Has Its Own Sprawling Air Force, Here’s What’s In Its Inventory","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the United States continues to slog through nearly two decades of fighting in Afghanistan , the fact that American diplomats and other civilian U.S. government personnel still have to take short, but expensive helicopter rides to get safely to and from Kabul’s airport and the U.S. Embassy there has made headlines. But this is just a small portion of the Department of State’s Air Wing’s operations, which span more than a half a dozen countries and involve hundreds of aircraft, some of them armed. Now, thanks to a new official audit, we have a good sense of just what’s in the inventory of America’s “other air force.” In September 2018, the Department of State’s Office of the Inspector General released its latest audit of the Air Wing, which is formally called the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, or INL/A. As of January 2018, the organization had more than 200 aircraft, making it one of the largest non-military aviation arms in a U.S. federal government agency. Not all of those aircraft, many which have come second or third hand from various U.S. government and other sources, are on active duty. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office , a congressional watchdog, determined State was also one of the top three federal owners of “non-operational” aircraft. “The Department’s aircraft can be used for many types of missions, which vary by location, and may include support for manual drug eradication, interdiction, reconnaissance, surveillance, command and control, medical evacuation, transportation of personnel or cargo, or other functions,” the audit noted. “INL/A is responsible for overseeing procedures governing maintenance, logistics, safety, and operational standards for the Department’s entire fleet.” A chart from the Department of State Office of the Inspector General’s 2018 audit of State’s Air Wing, giving an overview of its complete inventory., DoS OIG This is a far cry from the Air Wing’s beginnings in 1976 during the early days of the so-called “ War on Drugs ,” when its activities were entirely focused on counter-narcotics operations. At the beginning of 2018, INL/A had 60 government employees and another 13 contractors situated at its headquarters within the U.S. Air Force’s Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. At a cost of nearly $5 billion dollars in the 2018 fiscal year, State has hired private military company DynCorp to oversee more than 1,500 personnel worldwide. In 2018, the organization had assets positioned in Afghanistan , Colombia , Iraq , Panama , and Peru, and there were plans to re-open an operation in Guatemala before the end of the year. In 2017, INL/A had ceased flying from sites in Cyprus and Pakistan . A description of INL/A activities by country as of Fiscal Year 2017., DoS OIG With the exception of its activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, INL/A flies missions in support of the host country and often wearing the national insignia of their military or security forces. These operations have an important training component, as well, and State’s ultimate goal is often to sell or otherwise turn over aircraft directly to its partners after a certain point, often leading to significant turnover in aircraft within the Air Wing. The vast majority of INL/A active and inactive aircraft are variants and derivatives of the Bell UH-1 Huey helicopters , which typically conduct light transport and utility roles, as well as being able to insert and extract personnel from remote areas and perform medical evacuations. The fleet of nearly 120 choppers includes ex-U.S. military UH-1H and UH-1V variants , upgraded Huey IIs , twin-engine Model 212 types , and Model 214ST helicopters. An INL/A Bell Model 212., DoS Though auditors grouped the latter type in with the others, it is a substantially different aircraft. Unfortunately, we do not have a clear breakdown of how many of each sub-type the Air Wing has on hand. What we do know is that many of these helicopters are kitted out exactly as they would be for military use, with missile approach warning systems to spot incoming surface-to-air missiles and dispensers able to launch decoy flares. In some situations, such as past operations in Iraq and ongoing missions in Afghanistan, the contractor-operated choppers also carry mounted machine guns, including M240s and fast-firing Miniguns , for self-defense and for protection of other helicopters or personnel on the ground when conducting escort missions. A camouflaged Air Wing Huey II fires flares during a mission over Afghanistan., DoS The Air Wing’s fleet of more than 20 ex-U.S. Marine Corps Boeing Vertol CH-46E Sea Knights , which it operate predominantly in Afghanistan, have similar features. These blue-and-white painted aircraft are the ones that provide the shuttle service, known as Embassy Air, to and from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul to the American embassy compound just two miles away. The Embassy Air Program also operates in Iraq, which is significantly larger in scope, including regular, scheduled flights to and from neighboring Jordan. You can read more about that mission in detail here and here . Starting in 2010, State had planned to procure a fleet of 15 totally refurbished Sikorsky S-61T helicopters , armed with Miniguns and equipped with self-defense systems, to perform the Embassy Air mission. It had also acquired a number of older S-61Ns . For reasons that remain unclear, there were difficulties in acquiring these aircraft and when the CH-46Es became available as the Marines transitioned to the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor, the Air Wing acquired a number of them and quickly put them to work instead. Sikorsky did deliver the S-61Ts to the State in 2015 , at which point the bulk of them went straight into storage at Patrick Air Force Base. As of July 2017, only five were flying operationally, two in Cyprus and three in Iraq. The recently released audit said State still had 13 S-61Ts in storage, but a response from INL to a draft version of the report said that they had sold all of the S-61s, including the Ns, to unspecified buyers as of December 2017 by way of the General Services Administration (GSA). We don’t know whether or not the Department still owns a number of non-flyable H-3 Sea Kings , another S-61 variant, which it had acquired from the U.S. military to serve as parts donors for the new S-61Ts. State Department S-61Ts in storage., GSA The Air Wing has also secured more than 20 Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters of different variants from the U.S. Army, via that service’s Black Hawk Exchange and Sales Team, or BEST . At least some of those helicopters are supporting counter-narcotics operations in Colombia. This makes sense since that country has its own fleet of Black Hawk types and INL/A’s aircraft could make use of any existing operational facilities set up for those helicopters. State still has four MD-530 Little Bird light helicopters, as well, though these appear to all be in storage. The Air Wing had employed these small choppers in the past to conduct visual reconnaissance and escort missions, as well as ferry small numbers of personnel between sites. Air Wing UH-60s in Colombia., DoS OIG Beyond its helicopter fleets, INL/A also has more than 20 fixed-wing turboprop aircraft of various sizes, primarily for shuttling around senior officials either within a country or between sites in a broader region. These include twin-engine Dash-8s and Beechcraft 1900s and single-engine Cessna C208B Grand Caravans , all of which are popular and easy to maintain types. Pictures show that at least some of the Dash-8s have missile warning receivers and flare launchers installed. In the past, the Air Wing has acquired fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, but there is no indication that any of the aircraft in its inventory at present are equipped with turreted electro-optical cameras or other sensors. A single Fairchild-Dornier 328 Jet configured for ISR and command and control missions that INL/A had in 2014 has since gone to the Mexican Federal Police . State has also sold off its only twin-engine DC-3T turboprop transport, which had been flying operations from Cyprus, in May 2017. The year before, it had divested three ex-U.S. Army C-23B transport planes that had originally been bound for the Philippines Coast Guard, as well. INL/A has largely turned over its remaining Air Tractor AT-802 crop dusters, used to spray herbicides on drug fields, to partner nations. It does reportedly still have two of them in storage though. There is no indication that these aircraft have extra armor or other protective features, were present on highly modified Ayres Turbo Thrushes, known as Narcotics Eradication Delivery Systems , that the Air Wing operated in the 1980s and 1990s. State also long ago dropped plans to acquire armed aircraft in this class, which have since become increasingly popular around the world for light attack missions in limited conflicts. Two of State’s AT-802 crop dusters circa 2013., DoS The Air Wing’s fleet also includes five AeroVironment RQ-11B Raven hand-launched small drones, each of which can carry a color daytime full motion video camera or infrared type for night operations. These are short-range, tactical systems with a maximum range of just more than six miles, and are likely available to help INL train various local partner forces in their operation. The very last plane that State’s auditors recorded in INL/A’s inventory is far more curious than any of the rest. The Air Wing bought its lone turboprop Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Porter, which presently carries the U.S. civil registration code N907AW, in 2009 from Starflite International, Corp. The year before, Starflite had acquired it from a company called Ace Aircraft Corp., which had the plane registered to an address inside an office building in Northern Virginia. Shortly before Ace bought it in 1996, the previous owner, East Texas Aircraft Service Corp. had hired a Delaware-based firm called Summit Aviation to installed a military-style identification friend-or-foe transponder, additional communications equipment, and a night vision goggle compatible cockpit layout in the Porter, according to documents we at The War Zone obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration via the Freedom of Information Act. Summit Aviation has long-standing links to the Central Intelligence Agency and the most secretive elements of the U.S. military’s aviation communities dating back to the 1980s. While officially registered to Ace, the Porter was reportedly actually flying covert missions for the U.S. Air Force’s top secret 427th Special Operations Squadron, which you can read about in more detail here . A description of the work Summit Aviation did to the Pilatus Porter that the State Department’s Air Wing now owns., FAA via FOIA We don’t know how or why this aircraft has now made its way to State or whether it retains any of its specialized features. The audit does not offer any details about its activities since joining the Air Wing or what it might be up to now, but it did turn up in Peru in 2015 . It’s important to note that this report may not necessarily be a full or accurate accounting of the Air Wing’s inventory, as well. The auditors found there was a worrying lack of oversight over just what aircraft State owned and where INL/A was conducting operations. The Air Wing owned this DC-3T until May 2017., DoS “As a result of limited … oversight and the absence of evaluations to determine the appropriate usage and cost effectiveness of the Department’s aircraft operations worldwide, the Department is not optimally managing aviation resources and spent $72 million on unnecessary services from September 2013 to August 2017,” the auditors noted in their executive summary. “INL did not fully maintain sufficient accountability over aircraft equipment… In addition, Department aviation assets were not always disposed of in accordance with Department requirements, which resulted in more than $8 million in funds that could be put to better use.” It also doesn’t include any of the contractor-owned aircraft performing tasks for INL/A. State remains one of the potential agencies behind a fleet of shadowy gray S-92 helicopters that have most recently appeared in Syria. However, the auditors did not mention any contract air services in that country, but they did note that the Air Wing was overseeing the operations of dedicated charter aircraft in Cartersville, Georgia and Nairobi, Kenya. What the audit does show is that the Air Wing remains a major, if still largely obscure player in the State Department’s overseas activities and that its varied stable of aircraft truly forms another “air force” within the U.S. government.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For only the second time in U.S. Air Force history, the service has brought a B-52H Stratofortress bomber out of storage Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and delivered it to an operational unit. The aircraft, with the serial number 60-0034 and nicknamed Wise Guy, touched down at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana earlier today, where it will join the 307th Bomb Wing, the only bomb wing in the Air Force Reserve. Wise Guy’s return comes almost three years to the day after another one of the bombers crashed and burned at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and brings the size of the Air Force’s operational B-52H fleet back to a total of 76 aircraft, the maximum allowable number under the terms of an arms control treaty with Russia. U.S. Air Force Colonel Robert Burgess, the commander of the 307th Bomb Wing’s 307th Operations Group, flew Wise Guy, with the help of two additional members of the unit, from Arizona to Lousiana on May 14, 2019 . The plane arrived still wearing the “MT” tail code of aircraft assigned to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, which it was wearing when the 5th Bomb Wing first sent it to the Bone Yard in 2008. The bomber is also in desperate need of a new coat of paint and the plane is scheduled to go to the depot at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma for a full overhaul in February 2020, though this timeline could be subject to change. U.S. Air Force Colonel Robert Burgess, commander of the 307th Operations Group, 307th Bomb Wing, at the controls of Wise Guy, gives a thumbs up after touching down at Barksdale Air Force Base on May 14, 2019., USAF “We are excited about the wing’s role in bringing this jet back into service,” Burgess told reporters after arriving at Barksdale. “Its return is a testament to the skill of our Airmen in restoring the bomber for regular use in the Air Force.” The Air Force only revealed that it was in the process of “regenerating” Wise Guy in April 2019 , but it is unclear if that’s when the process actually began. The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG), which oversees the bone yard, has only ever done this once before and the last time it took 70 days. That B-52H, serial number 61-0007 and carrying the nickname Ghost Rider, returned to the active duty 2nd Bomb Wing, also situated at Barksdale, in February 2015. That plane had replaced another B-52H that ended up being totaled after an electrical fire broke out during routine maintenance the year before. Ghost Rider in February 2015., USAF Under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with Russia, the United States is limited to a fixed number of deployed nuclear weapon systems as defined under the terms of that deal. You can read more about those details here , but the mix of systems the U.S. military has elected to field in order to preserve its Nuclear Triad includes 76 B-52H bombers. The United States cannot, by treaty, have any more of these aircraft operational without sacrificing something else. The arms control deal does, however, allow for a number of non-deployed systems to remain in storage, primarily, as is the case with Wise Guy, to replace losses. As of April 15, 2019, the Air Force still had a dozen other B-52Hs in what is known as Type 1000 storage , which is the readiest state for an inactive aircraft. But even planes in Type 1000 storage need significant work to get them flying again. In Ghost Rider’s case, personnel at the bone yard had previously ripped out its GPS receiver and other navigation equipment for use on other operational B-52s, so these systems had to get replaced. Ghost Rider also needed a substantial overhaul to bring the bomber up to the latest baseline configuration, as it had missed various upgrades while in storage. Wise Guy will need the same treatment, having been out of service for more than a decade. A close up of Wise Guy’s still-intact art, which also carries the “MT” tail code for Minot Air Force Base., USAF When the 5th Bomb Wing sent Wise Guy to the Bone Yard in 2008, it seems that the personnel from the unit may have a nagging feeling in the back of their minds that the bomber might not be done with its service just yet. Someone left a note on a panel inside the plane that reads as follows: “AMARG, this 60-034, a Cold Warrior that stood sentinel over America from the darkest days of the Cold War to the global fight against terror. Take good care of her… Until we need her again.” The note on the panel inside Wise Guy., USAF It may be of interest to note that the “60” in Wise Guy’s serial number is the fiscal year in which the Air Force bought her. The very last of the B-52Hs rolled off Boeing’s production line in 1962, putting the plane in the latter half of the BUFF’s production run. The service expects to continue flying these bombers through at least 2050—and probably beyond—and has plans to make even more significant upgrades to them in the coming years, including the addition of new engines and radars . It appears that Wise Guy has indeed refused to fade away and the bomber now looks set to return to service and stay there for decades to come.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russian President Vladimir Putin flew to the country’s southwestern region today on board his IL-96-300PU presidential plane with an escort of six Su-57s , roughly half of the total number of the advanced fighter jets that the country has in total. Putin made the grand display as he traveled to the region to inspect various military units before departing for Sochi to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Putin arrived at the 929th Chkalov State Flight-Test Center in Russia’s southwestern Astrakhan region early on May 14, 2019 . The facility is the Russian military’s largest research and development site for advanced aircraft, as well as air defense systems. Just the sheer number of Su-57s flying together with Putin’s Il-96-300PU is notable. As of the end of 2018 , the Russian Air Force had around a dozen flying examples of the aircraft, which has been in protracted development for more than a decade now. This appears to be the first time so many of the jets have flown together at once. https://youtube.com/watch?v=W71xyS0955E Russia has said that it is deferring serial production of the type, but is also hunting for new international partners to potentially jumpstart the program. The Kremlin recently made a public offer to Turkey, which could be facing expulsion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program over opposition from the United States and its other NATO allies to a planned purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems . Though certainly not an equivalent to the F-35, the Su-57, if it functions as advertised, does offer a number of advanced capabilities, which you can read about in more detail here . After touching down at the Chkalov State Flight-Test Center, Putin inspected an array of advanced weapon systems, including the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile and the modified MiG-31 Foxhound aircraft capable of carrying it. This is one of six super weapons the Russian President revealed in 2018 in a fiery speech that served, in general, as an assertion of the country’s continued strength in the face of hostile actions from its international competitors, chiefly the United States. Putin also reportedly viewed an example of the still-in-development Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B flying wing drone, though the Kremlin did noes not appear to have released any new pictures. The first pictures of this unmanned aircraft, which has reportedly been in development since at least 2011, emerged online earlier this year. Beyond that, the Russian President also got a chance to inspect the latest models of the MiG Fulcrum and Sukhoi Flanker fighter jet families, including the MiG-35 Fulcrum-F and Su-35 Flanker-E . There was no mention of Putin receiving any updated information on Russia’s bomber programs, such as efforts to modernize the Tu-160 Blackjack and the Tu-22M Backfire , or the status of PAK DA advanced bomber , which the Kremlin insists is still in development, despite there being virtually no official information about it after more than a decade. A variety of air defense systems were on display, too, including the new S-350 Vityaz medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which began serial production in March 2019, and multiple iterations of the Panstir point defense air defense system. Russia has heavily promoted Pantsir in recent years, highlighting its operational activities in Syria, though reports have emerged that have questioned its actual efficacy against both terrorists’ locally-made drones and Israeli air strikes . The 50P6E transporter erector launcher for the S-350 Vityaz surface-to-air missile system., Vitaly Kuzmin Afterward, Putin left for the city of Sochi on the Black Sea to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the idea that the Russian President’s visit to the Chkalov State Flight-Test Center was meant to send a message to Pompeo ahead of their meeting. “The president deals with military and industrial complex issues twice a year and the goal is to develop the military and industrial complex, rather than to send any signals,” Peskov said . “No conspiracy theories should be concocted here.” Regardless, U.S.-Russia relations are at a particularly low point. But America’s top diplomat did take a very conciliatory stance ahead of an initial meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. “I am here today because President Trump is committed to improving this relationship,” Pompeo told reporters . “We have differences and each country will protect its interests, look out for its own people. But we are not adversaries on every issue and I hope that we can find places where we have a set of overlapping interests and can truly begin to build out strong relationships, at least on those particular issues.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on May 14, 2019., Ekaterina Lyzlova / Sputnik  via AP Still, the United States and Russia are presently at odds on a host of issues, including, as noted, the collapse of the INF and potential new negotiations related to New START. Russia has also opposed the U.S. government’s support for opposition leader Juan Guaido in Venezuela and criticized the Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the controversial international deal over Iran’s nuclear program. On the other side, the United States regularly criticizes the Kremlin’s continued support for Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and its active role in the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, among other things. The two countries have sparred over policy toward North Korea and accusations that the Russians are aiding Pyongyang in evading sanctions, too. “We have many difference here,” Lavrov said in much more frank comments after the meeting . “We will continue to discuss the situation.” Ahead of Pompeo’s subsequent meeting with Putin, the Russian leader did highlight that the conclusion Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, saying that it “ very objective ” and concluded that then-candidate Trump and his campaign had not actively colluded with the Russian government. He, of course, did not mention the Mueller had made clear that the Kremlin had actively interfered with the 2016 U.S. President Election, something that Russia continues to deny in spite of the all of the available evidence. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 14, 2019., Alexei Druzhinin / Sputnik  via AP “I’m hoping the situation is changing,” Putin said , referring to a purported desire for improved relations. “[I have] the impression that the president [Trump] is inclined towards the restoration of Russian-American ties, contacts and to solving issues together,” Putin added, saying this was what he understood after a recent call with his American counterpart. But the Russian President’s visit to the Chkalov State Flight-Test Center earlier in the day certainly seemed to underscore that the Kremlin has no plans, at least in the near term, to abandon its aggressive foreign policy and the military modernization efforts that go along with it, regardless of whether or not U.S. relations with Russia improve.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Although others have come before them, and certainly more have come after , in November of 2017, a pair of young aviators flying an EA-18G Growler out of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island made the art of aerial phallic expression a worldwide sensation . After many months of wondering the backstory behind the wind-borne wiener, we finally know the truth. In what has to be one of the most entertaining results from a Freedom Of Information Act request, Geoff Ziezulewicz, writing for Navy Times , not only gives us the full background on what came after the nutty incident, but he also provides the dialogue between the pilot and the electronic warfare officer (EWO) that preceded it. The following is Ziezulewicz’s eloquent presentation of that historic repartee: The day’s flight was to be a standard 90 minutes of training over the skies of north-central Washington. Their partner jet soon flew to another section of their training area, and the lieutenants got an idea. The EWO broached it first, according to the investigation. “My initial reaction was no, bad,” the pilot wrote in a statement after the incident. “But for some reason still unknown to me, I eventually decided to do it.” Their sky penis plan of attack was captured on their cockpit video recording system, a transcript of which is included in the investigation. “Draw a giant penis,” the EWO said. “That would be awesome.” “What did you do on your flight?” the pilot joked. “Oh, we turned dinosaurs into sky penises. “You should totally try to draw a penis,” the EWO advised. “I could definitely draw one, that would be easy,” the pilot boasted. “I could basically draw a figure eight and turn around and come back. I’m gonna go down, grab some speed and hopefully get out of the contrail layer so they’re not connected to each other.” They theorized on the second-order effects of their nascent sky drawing. “Dude, that would be so funny,” the pilot said. “Airliner’s coming back on their way into Seattle, just this big (expletive)ing, giant penis. We could almost draw a vein in the middle of it too.” Soon, the EWO reported they were definitely “marking.” They had found the sweet altitude, and the contrail sky penis was being born in their wake. “Balls are going to be a little lopsided,” the pilot advised. “Balls are complete,” he reported moments later. “I just gotta navigate a little bit over here for the shaft.” “Which way is the shaft going?” the EWO asked. “The shaft will go to the left,” the pilot answered. “It’s gonna be a wide shaft,” the EWO noted. “I don’t wanna make it just like 3 balls,” the pilot said. “Let’s do it,” the EWO said. “Oh, the head of that penis is going to be thick.” “Some like Chinese weather satellite right now that’s like, ‘what the (expletive)?’” the pilot surmised. The jet streaked across the sky, and the duo’s magnum opus continued to take shape, showcasing the pilot’s prowess in the process. “To get out of this, I’m gonna go like down and to the right,” the pilot said. “And we’ll come back up over the top and try to take a look at it.” “I have a feeling the balls will have dissipated by then,” his partner answered. “It’s possible,” the pilot said. They flew away to a distance where they could take in their work. They cracked up in the cockpit as their sky penis came into full view, snapping pics they would later delete once they realized their command would likely go apoplectic. “Oh yes, that was (expletive)ing amazing,” the pilot said. “This is so obvious.” “That’s a (expletive),” the EWO said. “Dude, I’m amazed that this stayed.” “Mishap pilot alpha said, ‘Dude, I’m gonna draw a (expletive),’” the EWO said. “EWO alpha said, ‘Yup, that’s a great idea.’” They waited to see if their partner jet would notice their work. “Your artwork is amazing,” the lieutenant commander EWO in the other jet radioed to them. “Glad you guys noticed,” the pilot replied. “Soon after, I realized the extent of our actions,” the pilot wrote. “That the contrails were remaining longer than predicted.” Evasive maneuvers became necessary. “I remarked that we needed to take steps to try to obfuscate it,” he wrote. “I flew one pass over it essentially trying to scribble it out with my contrails. That pass was ineffective.” And so, the legend was born. What came next for the artistic aviators wasn’t pretty. Make sure to read the entire account of the investigation by clicking here .

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 28, 2021",Air Force Tests Tiny Personnel Footprint For Operating Fighters In Austere Combat Zones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Air Force continues to come to terms with the fact that their sprawling air bases with long runways and extensive support infrastructure located near potential international hotspots are likely doomed in a major conflict, there is real progress being made to distill down its fighting doctrine into the smallest possible pieces. This will theoretically allow for dispersed operations over a huge geographical expanse, at bases that could be built up in a number of days and may only support transient or small detachments of combat aircraft. You can read much more about the Air Force’s emerging strategy to quickly activate remote operating locations for expeditionary operations in this past article of ours. Now, the flying force is experimenting with absolute minimal manning for austere operations, where a military policeman may end up refueling tactical fighters while another airman quickly goes from hanging ordnance on the aircraft to manning a defensive position with a light machinegun. Half a decade ago, the Air Force began experimenting with rapidly deploying small numbers of its most capable fighter aircraft on short notice as a way to adapt to the changing nature of warfare and the threat picture the U.S. could face abroad in the coming years—one that would morph from a localized counter-insurgency focus to one on peer state conflicts that occur over massive geographical areas. At the time, the F-22 community led with this concept, known as Rapid Raptor , but it has since matured , expanded , trickled down to other communities in the USAF, and is now at the precipice of being woven into a far grander strategy. The idea is that during a peer state conflict, like one against China that predominately takes place in the Pacific, regional bases would be destroyed very early on by ballistic and cruise missile strikes. This would push out American air power many hundreds or even thousands of miles away from enemy territory. As such, being able to rapidly deploy small groups of tactical aircraft to austere locales, even just temporarily, will not only allow for missions that can reach near or inside of the enemy’s anti-access bubble, but doing so will also drastically complicate the enemy’s ability to defend itself by creating a massive number of potential vectors of attack. Even with aerial refueling, America’s thirsty fighter fleet have combat ranges measured in hundreds, not thousands of miles. This could put the tankers themselves in danger, something we have discussed in-depth many times in the past . In addition, even aircraft that can successfully get close enough to the enemy to strike need places they can divert to due to mechanical, battle damage, or operational issues, including the potential loss of tanking assets to enemy action. Beyond that, there just aren’t enough tankers to refuel throngs of allied aircraft over thousands of miles. So basing small contingents of tactical aircraft closer to the fight itself, or at least being able to refuel and rearm them , may not only be a prudent and more survivable strategy, it may also be a necessity. The USAF is not alone when it comes to focusing on bringing high-end air combat power to austere locations. The USMC, which has a more colorful history in these types of operations, is also stepping up its own experimentation and training in this regard. Seen here an F-35B gets refueled from a CH-53E. , DoD So, with all this in mind, the USAF is pushing ahead to experimenting with how to rapidly build up austere bases and how to operate from them once they are operational and the other services are also following suit to different degrees . Part of this initiative has been realized via a set of experimental exercises, the latest taking place at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base and two other operating locations, that really took the idea of a small operational footprint for austere fighter operations to the next level. In an official release , the USAF described the experiment in-depth as such: The Combat Support Wing proof-of-concept capstone exercise developed by the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center and hosted by Air Combat Command’s 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, tested the ability of three teams of about 30 Airmen each to establish and operate an airfield in an austere environment. They had to defend the base and refuel and rearm F-15E Strike Eagles using multifunctional skills they learned during training events over the past month. “We’ve seen monumental improvements in the ability of our Airmen to do things outside of their normal career fields and the speed at which they’re able to refuel and rearm jets,” said Brig. Gen. Brian Bruckbauer, AFIMSC director of expeditionary support and innovation. Bruckbauer’s directorate led the planning and execution of the exercise. The concept supports National Defense Strategy priorities to evolve innovative operational concepts and enhance lethality in contested environments. If fielded, the CSW concept could give the Air Force the ability to rapidly deploy in smaller, more efficient and agile teams to austere and potentially contested areas. Under the multifunctional construct, weapons loaders could drive a refueling truck, security forces defenders could refuel a jet and avionics specialists could provide airfield security while also performing their primary duties. CSW is an outcome of the 2017 AFIMSC Installation and Mission Support Weapons and Tactics Conference. The capstone was the final event in a phased rollout of the concept over the past year. It tested the hub-and-spoke operations of a single forward operating base at Seymour Johnson AFB and three forward operating locations at Kinston Regional Jetport, Moody AFB, Georgia, and MacDill AFB, Florida. “We had at least 15 different Air Force specialty codes come in to attack the problem of how to conduct integrated combat turns with as few people and the smallest logistics footprint as possible,” said Col. Erik Rundquist, AFIMSC Detachment 8 commander, at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, who was one of the primary architects responsible for turning the concept into practicable exercise scenarios. Master Sgt. Jason Knepper, an Air Force Security Forces Center flight chief, joined the CSW cadre in January as a security forces functional lead. He’s said he’s seen “tons” of progress since capstone participants began training in mid-April. “We went from individual troops who had their skillset and a vague understanding about what everyone else was doing to now where you’ve got maintainers manning defensive fighting positions and cops helping refuel jets,” Knepper said. “The construct for the multifunction approach is working really well. The people who built those pieces did a phenomenal job and now we’re seeing it work.” He said Airmen can execute the concept very well when given the opportunity, training and motivation to see why it’s important. One of those Airmen was Senior Airman Darian Betancourt, an aircraft armament systems specialist at the 4th FW. He learned how to drive R-11 fuel trucks, palletize cargo, conduct tactical combat casualty care and defend the base. “It’s been different. It’s been fun too,” Betancourt said. “You gain appreciation for your job and other people’s jobs and you learn what they do.” He said the experience was eye-opening. “There’s so much to the Air Force that people don’t get to see and doing something like this really shows that,” Betancourt said. “If everybody could do this (multifunctional learning), that would be something special.” Airman Betancourt is absolutely right, moving to a multi-functional capability for at least some of the USAF’s airman could prove to be a huge boon during a major conflict and could squeeze so much more out of the existing rigid Air Force personnel structure. A major issue here is training. For an Air Force that is already undermanned and overtaxed, placing more training requirements on personnel could be problematic and logistically challenging. Then again, giving airmen a greater swathe of responsibility and added potential roles during combat operations is exciting and engaging. It could potentially even help with retainment and even recruiting, at least for some individuals. The Combat Support Wing capstone experiment at Seymour Johnson AFB saw airman that usually don’t even touch jets refueling them and helping with all facets of sortie generation and force protection., USAF It’s not as if similar schemes haven’t worked for other air arms. Sweden, in particular, has built its tactical air force around an austere operations model that uses small and agile support units, that in some cases accomplish more with far less than more traditional arrangements. Infusing some of that mindset into the USAF’s combat doctrine and culture seems like a totally relevant and positive move. Setting up a mini base with as little as 30 personnel, while still being able to turn fighter jet sorties and defend the outpost from attack, is an amazing capability. Above all else, it shows that the USAF, which is often far too set in its ways to even experiment with major changes in how it operates like this, really sees austere basing as a necessity for future operations. It also points to the idea that resiliency and redundancy in terms of personnel can be had through training and personal empowerment, not just adding more heads to a roster. Airman that took part in the experiment trained at Fort Bliss in Texas to hone their ground-combat skills and learn how to defend their positions from enemy attack. , USAF The Air Force says that it is now ready to report its findings from the experiment to higher command and another implementation of the concept is already planned this summer: The AFIMSC Expeditionary Support Directorate is now expected to produce a report for Air Force leaders that includes data on more than 100 measures of effectiveness. “We’ll be able to provide our senior leaders with a very thorough analysis and some very good recommendations going forward on force structure, force presentation and multi-functional training with the goal of using this concept in our operational plans,” Bruckbauer said. The CSW concept will be included in the Rapid Forge exercise scheduled for July 10-26 in Europe With any luck, this concept will be pushed forward on an operational level to see how airmen react to it and its effectiveness beyond just a limited experiment. Considering that it devolves responsibility down to small agile units and unlocks the individual airman’s adaptability and creativity, it probably will be an amazing addition to a force structure that could really use it.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In the midst of a future conflict, an American fighter jet is shot down while operating over hostile territory. The terrain is too complicated and risks are too great to send in a traditional combat search and rescue team, so U.S. commanders turn to a novel option: air-drop a small, ultra-quiet autonomous air vehicle with short or vertical take-off and landing capabilities near the crash site so the downed aviator can fly to safety. Though it may sound like a scene straight out of a sci-fi war movie set in the near future, this is a concept the U.S. Air Force wants to actively explore . The Air Force Research Laboratory first posted the request for proposals for what they blandly described as a “Personnel Recovery / Transport Vehicle” on the U.S. military’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program website on May 2, 2019 . “In supporting the 2018 National Defense Strategy there is a need to deploy, survive, operate, maneuver, and regenerate in all domains while under attack in theaters throughout the globe,” the notice says. “Diverse environments will require operations from new isolated locations , at greater distances, requiring low cost solutions for increasing our options for providing transport of small teams of personnel into and out of harm’s way without increasing the number of personnel at risk (the aircrew) needed to move these teams.” AFRL didn’t specify what type of configuration this new unmanned aircraft should have, such as a traditional helicopter or tilt-rotor design, but there is “significant private sector investment that could be leveraged for this military mission is the personal air vehicle (PAV) and urban air mobility (UAM) efforts,” the contracting notice notes. “These efforts have been focused on urban operations for on-demand civilian transport and have many parallel design requirements to that desired under this SBIR but with some modifications to meet the military mission.” Bell’s Nexus, a commercial air taxi rotorcraft the company has said will initially be manned, but will eventually be capable of autonomous operation. The Air Force says these sorts of developments in Urban Air Mobility sector could help support its work on an autonomous rescue aircraft., Bell The urban air mobility sector, focused heavily on air taxi and bus concepts , as well as work on the development of practical personal air vehicles , or “ flying cars ,” has exploded in recent years in the United States and elsewhere around the world . These include, but are hardly limited to, Bell’s Nexus and Boeing’s NeXt concepts. Bell is already working in cooperation with rideshare firm Uber on potential air taxi services, while Boeing’s Aurora Flight Sciences subsidiary has been supporting NeXt’s initial phases with the development of a Passenger Air Vehicle . These are the sorts of developments that AFRL says it hoping to leverage in the design of a future autonomous rescue platform. The actual stated requirements for the Air Force’s notional air-droppable rescue transport are relatively spartan. The objective goal is for an aircraft that can accommodate four full-equipped personnel for a combined payload weight of 1,400 pounds, but the minimum requirement is two people, including one potentially on a stretcher. The aircraft needs to have a 100-nautical mile combat radius while cruising at speeds of no less than 100 knots, or more than 115 miles per hour, while carrying that full payload. AFRL wants it to have a 30-minute fuel reserve, too, in case of a need to divert to a different location or otherwise respond to new objectives. It also needs to be able to operate in hot-and-high conditions, defined as an altitude of at least 4,000 feet and a temperature of at least 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Beyond that, the aircraft has to operate from a landing zone as small as 2,500 square feet, which could be in “desert, jungle, mountainous, and maritime (ship to shore transport)” environments. “Water recovery of personnel is a desired capability but not a requirement,” AFRL’s notice adds. The video below shows Aurora Flight Sciences Passenger Air Vehicle, an autonomous platform that the company says could be suitable for use as an air taxi or as a personal air vehicle, and that could potentially serve as a starting place for the AFRL’s requirements. The aircraft also has to be quiet, specifically to reduce the probability of detection. This is another place where commercial developments could play a role, since companies working on urban air mobility concepts are well aware that the prospect of greatly increased noise from more routine air traffic in cities could lead to public opposition to their plans. The Air Force has no other stated requirements for features that could reduce the small transport’s radar or infrared signatures . There is no specific provision for a pilot since “the personnel recovery / transport vehicle envisioned is highly autonomous,” according to the contracting notice. The plan is for it to fly “either remotely through secure datalink similar to unmanned aircraft systems/remotely piloted aircraft in use by Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD), or through minimal control inputs by the person onboard and not requiring significant training.” The U.S. military as a whole is also investing significant resources into the development of autonomous aircraft and many of these efforts could be applicable to this kind of small personnel transport. The U.S. Army, in particular, is working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on an artificial intelligence-enabled system to serve as a virtual co-pilot for helicopter crews, which could also be a stepping stone to pilot-optional operation. You can read more about the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program here . The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have been working in a similar direction with their Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System ( AACUS ) effort. But there could also be drawbacks to the Air Force’s plans. During combat search and rescue operations, as well as other casualty evacuation and personnel recovery missions, the individuals in need of extraction are often injured, potentially too seriously to make their way to a rescue aircraft, autonomous or not. With the aircraft handling the flying, any additional personnel on board could conceivably focus more on tending to any seriously wounded individuals. There is no guarantee that they will be in a place where the unmanned aircraft can set down or where an airdrop would be practical, or that they would be able to readily get to an appropriate location due to injuries or hostile activity in the area. The Air Force does note that the autonomous feature also means that personnel could conceivably bring the vehicle to a forward staging site and then launch it to the desired location, rather than having to airdrop it directly individuals in need. The Air Force is interested in a design small enough to fit inside a C-130 Hercules transport plane or for a CH-47 Chinook helicopter to carry slung underneath. If a CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor can carry it in some fashion, that would be great, too, according to the notice. But depending on the operational environment, deploying the unmanned aircraft from a forward location could carry many of the same risks and limitations as employing a manned platform, though it would reduce the danger to aircraft. This isn’t the first time the U.S. military has looked into ways for downed pilots, or other individuals on the round needing immediate extraction, a means to fly themselves to safety rather, either. In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Marines looked into both small single-person helicopters and ultra-light fixed-wing planes you could inflate like a balloon as potential alternatives to traditional helicopters. None of these proved to be practical. But more recently, the U.S. Army experimented with a small tandem-rotor drone helicopter , resembling a miniature CH-47, as an alternative to using real Chinooks or UH-60 Black Hawks for casualty evacuation in certain circumstances. There are a number of projects in the works for small autonomous unmanned aircraft to deliver supplies to the front lines that might also be adaptable to casualty evacuation and personnel recovery missions. DARPA and the Marines had been working with Lockheed Martin and Piasecki Aircraft on one such effort, known as the Aerial Reconfigurable Embedded System (ARES), but they canceled that project just days ago due to rising costs. AFRL’s newly proposed concept could potentially be adaptable in the other direction to take on logistics missions or other roles. Perhaps the biggest question that remains about the Air Force’s proposed autonomous rescue platform, especially the final design is derived commercial air taxi concepts, will be how is it supposed to survive in an environment already threatening enough to bring down a military aircraft? There are already serious concerns about how the U.S. plans to respond in the future if a fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , gets shot down, in general. These stealthy planes will be regularly operating in areas that are, by definition, too dangerous for non-stealthy aircraft to go. A stealth transport of some kind might be necessary to safely air-drop this new system in a high-risk scenario. But, regardless, as AFRL noted in its announcement, future conflicts will increasingly demand additional tools to conduct combat search and rescue, casualty evacuation, and personnel recovery missions. This will be especially true of high-end conflicts where personnel in need of rescue may find themselves inside the umbrella of a hostile integrated air defense network that all but precludes the employment of traditional rescue platforms. So, depending on the circumstances, American pilots unlucky enough to get shot down in the future may find themselves calling for friendly forces to just drop them another small aircraft so they can fly back to safety.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 8, 2019","U.S. Government Claims Iran Is Behind Attacks On Oil Tankers, But Has Yet To Show Evidence","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. military team in the United Arab Emirates has reportedly come to the initial assessment that Iran or one of its proxies was responsible for attacks on four oil tankers near that country’s port city of Fujairah yesterday , though there are no details yet about how they arrived at this conclusion. This comes amid a separate report that the Pentagon revised at least one of its contingency plans to deploy as many as 120,000 personnel to the Middle East in the event that Iranian forces or proxies launch attacks on Americans or begin apparent work toward building a nuclear weapon. Multiple outlets have reported late on May 13, 2019, that the Pentagon has pointed the finger at Iran, all citing unnamed U.S. government sources. The details they received, that all four ships suffered five-to-10 foot wide holes in the hulls at or near the waterline, are the same, though. Authorities in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore have now identified all four ships, as well. Two of the tankers, Amjad and Al Marzoqah , are flagged in Saudi Arabia, while a third unnamed ship is registered in Sharjah, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE. The last vessel, the Andrea Victory , is a Norwegian-flagged tanker that belongs to a shipping group, Thome Ship Management, headquartered in Singapore. Video of the Andrea Victory has emerged showing the hole in its rear hull and remains the only publicly available imagery of the damage to any of the ships. Thome has only said that the ship hit an “ unknown object ,” though it certainly looks to be the result of a mine or other weapon. However, neither the Saudis, the Emiratis, nor the United States has offered any specific details on the weapon or weapons employed or any other specifics about the apparent attacks. It is also unclear how the U.S. military team, which the Pentagon said it had just dispatched today , was able to arrive at its initial assessment so quickly. “We discussed … what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah,” U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told reporters earlier on May 13, 2019 . “We have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.” Hook held the press conference around Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s short-notice visit to Brussels to meet with representatives from multiple European allies, the European Union, and NATO. Pompeo postponed his arrival in Sochi, where he is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in order to stop in Belgium. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, second from the right, and U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, second from the left, meet with European Union representatives on May 13, 2019., Department of State “Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Hook said. “The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly.” The U.S. government has said relatively little publicly about the nature of the intelligence it received last week that purportedly indicated that Iran or its proxies were potentially planning to launch attacks on American interests, and those of its allies, across the Middle East. The initial reports caused Pompeo to abruptly skip meetings in Germany and instead make an unscheduled visit to Iraq to meet with officials in that country, the government of which has strong relations with Iran. The New York Times has also reported that Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan presented an updated contingency plan to President Donald Trump and other senior administration officials on May 9, 2019, regarding how the U.S. military could respond if Iran or its proxies were to follow through with any attacks, or if that country were to begin work toward building a nuclear weapon. Iran has repeatedly said that it has no interest in nuclear weapons and there is no evidence that it is actively pursuing them. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan speaks to reporters outside of the Pentagon on May 9, 2019., Kyodo via AP Images But Iranian officials did recently threaten to increase enrichment of uranium, ostensibly for nuclear energy purposes, if the remaining parties to the controversial deal over the country’s nuclear program did not meet its various demands for a new arrangement. The Trump Administration pulled out of the Iran Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018. If Iran were to begin enriching uranium to 20 percent purity or above, it would position itself much closer to a nuclear weapons breakout capability should it decide. The plan Shanahan presented to Trump involved the deployment of air, land, and sea forces to the Middle East. This would be a major contingency operation involving a force package that would consist of some 120,000 personnel and is unrelated to the recent expedited deployment of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its associated strike group to the Persian Gulf or the relatively small deployments of U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers and F-15C fighter jets , an additional U.S. Navy amphibious ship , and a U.S. Army Patriot surface-to-air missile battery elsewhere in the region. One of four B-52 bombers the U.S. Air Force recently deployed to the Middle East in response to reported potential threats from Iran conducts its first deterrence mission in the region on May 12, 2019., USAF The revised plan does not reportedly call for a ground invasion of Iran, according to The New York Times , which did not say what it did include. This would effectively leave only “bloody nose” stand-off strikes against critical targets in Iran, such as those linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs . Those same strikes could seek to neuter Iran’s more threatening standing military capabilities, such as its ballistic missiles , shore-based anti-ship missiles , naval mining assets , submarines , small manned and unmanned boats capable of swarming attacks, and unmanned aerial vehicles . All of these systems could potentially help Iran follow through on its oft-repeated threat to blockade the Strait of Hormuz , which is vital to the transshipment of a significant portion of the world’s oil and gas supplies. Additional forces would be necessary to guard American and allies interests against counterattacks, including potential ballistic missile strikes and terrorist attacks . It is not clear whether the present iteration of this contingency plan includes the Obama-era provision for a massive cyberattack, known as Nitro Zeus , to cripple the country’s military command and control networks, air defenses, and communications and power infrastructure, among other things . In meeting with Pompeo, despite whatever evidence America’s top diplomat presented, the United States’ European allies primarily expressed concern that the United States was at risk of stumbling into a conflict through miscalculations or misinterpretations of the available information. “We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side,” Jeremy Hunt, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary, said . In the meantime, questions as to the source and quality of the initial intelligence the U.S. received on potential Iranian threats, as well as the nature and justification of the initial assessment of Iranian culpability on the recent attacks on the oil tankers off Fujairah, remain almost entirely unanswered publicly. All of this only adds to what has already been a largely unexplained series of events coupled with an equally spotty narrative. “We’ll see what happens with Iran,” President Trump also told reporters on May 13, 2019 . “If they do anything, it would be a very bad mistake.” But with the U.S. government already taking the position that Iran or its proxies were behind the recent attacks on the tankers near Fujairah, the situation in the Middle East only continues to escalate.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 15, 2019",F-35A Pictured On “Deterrence Mission” Over Middle East With Peculiar Single Missile Loadout,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon is pumping out high-profile imagery depicting its aerial capabilities that are now in the Persian Gulf area of operations, some of which was deployed there on short notice due to the still not fully explained threat supposedly posed by Iran and its proxy forces against U.S. interest and its allies in the region. U.S. Air Force F-35As from Hill AFB in Utah deployed to Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE weeks before the specter of a possible military engagement with Iran was raised. The historic deployment has already seen the jets execute their first combat missions, but now the USAF says they are flying ‘deterrence missions’ over and around the Persian Gulf along with F-15s and B-52s that are also forward deployed as well. But the configuration of the F-35 shown in one of the images—seen at the top of this article—is a bit puzzling for such a mission. During their recent combat operations over Iraq, the F-35As flew with their radar reflectors attached, as well as their outer-wing missile rails with AIM-9X Sidewinders installed. You can read more about the U.S. Air Force F-35A’s first combat mission and this configuration in this past article of ours , but to put it directly, flying in non-stealthy configuration keeps the F-35’s radar signature secretive in a region with real foes that have access to powerful sensor systems. It also allows the jets to be more easily tracked and offers the ability to carry AIM-9Xs on missions, which are useful for engaging targets within visual range—something that may not be avoidable depending on the rules of engagement in the tense and dense Middle East area of operations. Yet the photo shows the F-35A armed with a single AIM-9X, with the other rail empty. This seems quite odd for a combat air patrol over an area that is getting tenser by the moment . If the pylons and radar reflectors are fitted, why not take advantage of the jet’s external stores capability and fly with a pair of Sidewinders? It seems like a strange decision considering the circumstances. USAF Maybe there is a shortage of air-to-air missiles at Al Dhafra. This seems like a very strange thing to posit, but the F-15Cs that deployed last week to the region from England flew in fully loaded with live missiles. This is not a common practice in our experience. Otherwise, it seems as if the threat can’t be that pressing if the F-35s are sortied on non-training flights with one of two external missile rails left empty and in unstealthy configuration. With that in mind, maybe just being able to signal to an aircraft that may get intercepted by an F-35 that the stealthy fighter is indeed armed is what is most important. The F-35A can carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs concealed in its weapons bays at any given time, as well. On the other hand, the F-15C that is also shown in the released images is bristling with a full counter-air loadout. USAF At first glance, another explanation could be that this was a training flight and the USAF just presented the image as something otherwise for information warfare purposes. Flying with a single AIM-9X captive training round makes perfect sense for training sorties. But we were able to brighten the image and zoom in on the missile enough to just make out its orange bands that signify it is a live round. So the idea that it is a mislabeled training flight is out. It is possible that the powers that be deemed the mission as not risky enough to put the hours on the live missile airframes, which can cost many hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Still, this seems like an odd move in a region that supposedly could erupt in conflict at any given moment. Three separate people have mentioned to us that the F-35, in particular, puts heavy stress on the AIM-9X when flying it on its underwing hardpoints. We have no information at this time that corroborates these claims. If the F-35’s had F-15s covering them, there really wasn’t a need to carry any missiles at all. The F-35 is an incredibly powerful electronic intelligence collection platform that can suck-up real-time data of the enemy’s electronic order of battle that would be sorely needed if a conflict were to suddenly occur. But once again, this doesn’t explain the single AIM-9X on the jet pictured. If you are going to mount the pylons, why not make the best of the limited capability offered? In the end, this is just another tiny piece of an increasingly confusing narrative—or lack thereof—as to why exactly military tensions with Iran are rapidly building and what the Pentagon is doing about it. Still at the heart of this matter is the question of what intelligence—and of what quality—did the Trump Administration actually receive concerning looming aggressive acts ordered by Tehran. Beyond that, the question remains how much of this projection of military might is for show, or is part of a separate contrived narrative, and how much of it is a tangible requirement based on reliable intelligence and on further information that has come via investigation after the fact. At this point in time, we have no way of accurately answering that question.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2019",Video Showing Damaged Norwegian Tanker Emerges After Reported Gulf “Sabotage” Attacks (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Video has emerged showing damage to the Norwegian-flagged oil tanker Andrea Victory following a purported “sabotage” attack on multiple oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. The ship’s owner, Singapore-headquartered Thome Ship Management, has confirmed the damage, but said the ship was never in danger of sinking and the exact circumstances of the incident remain murky. All of this comes amid continues U.S. government claims that it has intelligence that Iran or its proxies could strike out at its interests in the region, or those at its allies, including targeting commercial shipping. The clip, seen in the Tweet below, appeared online on May 13, 2019, but its origin is unclear and it is undated. The video shows a hole torn in the rear of Andrea Victory ‘s hull along the waterline. The tanker is one of four ships that UAE authorities claim suffered attacks near the Port of Fujairah, situated some 85 miles south of the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the day before. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, so far, and the UAE and Saudi Arabia have not accused any particular entity of having carried them out or otherwise supported the saboteurs. “The master of MT Andrea Victory reported the crew were unharmed but there was a hole in the hull area of the aft peak tank,” Thome said in its statement. “The ship is not in any danger of sinking.” There was no reportedly leak of any oil and most modern tankers have double-walled hulls specifically to help prevent this after suffering any significant damage. The aft peak tank itself is a ballast tank rather than an oil storage tank. There is still no information, or even claims, as to how the damage to Andrea Victory occurred specifically. From the video, it certainly looks as if a mine or improvised explosive device of some kind could have been responsible, though Thome’s statement simply described whatever hit the ship as an “ unknown object .” Some have suggested that divers could have placed a limpet mine on the ship’s hull. There have also been anti-ship missile attacks on military ships in the Red Sea on the other side the Arabian Peninsula and other attacks on commercial tankers in that region may have involved rocket-propelled grenades. Saudi Arabia has also identified its tankers Amjad and Al Marzoqah as being involved in the incident near Fujairah, while the identity of the fourth ship remains unknown. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih said the damage to his country’s two ships was “significant,” but there are no pictures or video to independently verify this claim. Though none of the affected parties has pointed the finger at any particular actor, the incident comes amid a spike in tension between Iran and both the United States and its regional competitors, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which The War Zone has been following very closely and that you can read about more here and here . On May 9, 2019, the U.S. Maritime Administration had issued an alert specifically warning about the increased potential that Iran or its proxies could launch attacks of military or commercial ships in the Persian Gulf, as well as the Red Sea and the Mandeb Strait . It is important to note that similar warnings about potential threats to commercial shipping from Iranian proxies in the region have come from U.S. and other international shipping authorities with some regularity since at least 2016 . Still, this latest combination of reported threats and warnings has fueled new speculation that Iran, or one of its many regional partners, may have been responsible for this latest incident off the coast of the UAE, though there is no hard evidence yet to support those claims. There are some parallels to a series of attacks on Saudi oil tankers in the Red Sea in 2018, which Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for. A picture of the Saudi tanker Arsan after one reported attack in July 2018 showed damage to the rear hull, but above the waterline. After those attacks, reports emerged that an Iranian cargo ship, M/V Saviz , linked to the country’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, might have been actively supporting those raids and perhaps even acting as a mother ship for manned speed boats or unmmanned explosive-laden watercraft . The Saviz was already tied to weapons smuggling into Yemen to support the Houthis and the Trump Administration sanctioned it by name in November 2018 .  As of January 2019, this ship was still operating in the Red Sea. An image Saudi Arabian authorities released in 2018 showing speed boats on the upper deck of  the Iranian cargo ship M/V Saviz that could be used for smuggling or attacks on ships., Government of Saudi Arabia For its part, Iranian authorities have decried the Fujairah attacks as “worrisome and dreadful” and called for an investigation into the incident, which a spokesman for the country’s Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, said could “have [a] negative impact on maritime transportation security.” At the same time, it’s important to note that some of the first reports about this new incident came from Lebanon-based Al Mayadeen television, an outlet reportedly funded by Iran and a cousin of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, a major Iranian ally in the region. The outlet is known for taking stances supportive of Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , which receives funding and other support from Iran, and the Assad regime. Al Mayadeen initially reported that the attacks had set between seven and 10 oil tankers on fire and that explosions had damaged port facilities ashore, as well. Iranian media widely amplified this report , before the UAE denied these claims, countering with the statement that only four ships had suffered any damage. Of course, this is hardly the first time there have been confusing and conflicting reports about attacks on ships in the region in which there are at least circumstantial ties to Iran. Details surrounding a Houthi attack on a UAE ship off the coast of Yemen in 2017 remain virtually non-existent and information about the exact scale of the attacks on tankers in the Red Sea last year is extremely limited . The obvious concern now is, with tensions already rising in the region by the day, that some sort of misstep or miscalculation could lead to outright conflict between Iran and the United States, along with its allies. The attacks near Fujairah notably come as the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and the rest of her Carrier Strike Group (CSG) are heading toward the Persian Gulf. The USS Arlington , a San Antonio -class landing platform dock amphibious ship is also heading toward the region to join the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and other elements of her Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), including portions of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. All of these ships are likely to be on particularly high alert following these attacks on commercial oil tankers. A Marine from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Group mans a .50 caliber M2 machine gun on a Humvee on the deck of the USS Kearsarge as a force protection measure as the ship heads through the Strait of Hormuz on May 7, 2019., USN The War Zone will certainly continue to keep a close eye on the situation and update our coverage as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 2:00pm EST— The UAE has asked the U.S. government for assistance in investigating the attacks near Fujairah and the Pentagon has said the United States agreed to send a team, although it is unclear if this means these individuals will be members of the U.S. military. “Experts will look at damage patterns, try to recover any material from the site, and calculate any launch point locations if they determine some kind of missile or weapon hit the ships,” according to CNN’s Barbara Starr. UPDATE: 4:50pm EST— Spain has announced that it’s Álvaro de Bazán -class frigate ESPS Méndez Núñez , which is sailing as part of the USS Abraham Lincoln ‘s Carrier Strike Group, will not join the rest of those ships in entering the Persian Gulf. It is unclear whether or not this is a product of a risk assessment by Spanish authorities, a desire on Madrid’s part to avoid the potential of being caught in the midst of rising U.S.-Iran tensions, or some combination of both. The Méndez Núñez will remain in the region in order to rejoin the Lincoln if and when the carrier exits the Persian Gulf to continue the rest of its scheduled cruise. The Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is supposed to conduct operations in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific before returning home.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 13, 2019",Oil Tankers Supposedly Attacked In Persian Gulf As U.S. Carrier Group Approaches (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. War drums are sounding a bit louder this morning as news comes that supposedly a pair of oil tankers was ‘sabotaged’ in the Persian Gulf according to Saudi Arabia. No specifics about the actions or who is responsible for them have been given, but the announcement comes as the U.S. claims it has intelligence that Iran could lash out at U.S. interests in the region and its allies. To get caught up and to understand the potential catalysts for all this, make sure to read this piece first and our latest piece on the subject second , but suffice to say that the U.S. has made cryptic claims regarding nefarious Iranian intentions as extra American military hardware moves into the region. This includes the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group—which supposedly passed through the volatile Mandeb Strait yesterday without incident—as well as a quartet of B-52 bombers. USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on its way into the Red Sea on May 9th, 2019., USN The landing platform dock amphibious ship USS Arlington has also been dispatched to the region along with at least one Patriot missile battery. F-15Cs from RAF Lakenheath also showed up in the area late last week, although we still don’t know if their arrival was long-planned. Then again, it seems most of this was already scheduled to some degree, but portions of it were pushed forward due to the intelligence about potential pending Iranian aggression which remains nebulous at best, at least in terms of what the public has been told. As for the attacks on the tankers, the New York Times states that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the two tankers suffered “significant damage” from the incidents, but they did not result in a major release of oil into the sea. One of the ships was supposedly on its way to pick up oil from Saudi Arabia and deliver it to the United States. The attacks occurred off of UAE’s Fujairah Emirate, one of the biggest bunkering locales for ships in the entire region. Before the announcement from Saudi Arabia hit, the UAE claimed that four vessels were attacked off its eastern shore over the weekend. It remains unknown if that number is still accurate or if it even includes the two ships Saudi Arabia have mentioned, although it likely does. We still don’t have any visual proof or third-party confirmation that these attacks took place or as to the nature of their severity. The U.S. Maritime Administration had put out a warning last Thursday regarding elevated threats from Iran on potential targets in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Mandeb Strait, including the possibility that Iran or its proxies could target commercial vessels, including tankers, as well as military ships. Still, we can’t stress enough that there is a glaring lack of detail about the attacks on the tanker ships. In particular, how the attack was executed—via frogmen, mine, torpedo, RPG, missile, etc.—not to mention who is supposedly behind them. Hopefully, we will get verification and new details regarding the incidents before the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group pushes through the same volatile area. The location where these tankers were supposedly hit is just roughly 85 miles south of the Strait Of Hormuz. If indeed this was an attack by Iranian forces, Lincoln’s transit has already become even tenser than it was going to be a day prior and the carrier’s mission once it arrives in the area may have also changed. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a sudden detour to Iraq last week to discuss the potential Iranian threat with parts of the Iraqi Government, has nixed a controversial trip to Sochi, Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin and will head to Brussels to talk to NATO allies about Iran instead. Regardless of what actually happened to those two ships off UAE’s eastern shore, the geopolitical and military temperature is clearly climbing in the Persian Gulf.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Will Someone Please Buy This Biggest And Baddest Of Gee Bee Air Racers?!,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When I hear the words ‘Gee Bee’ it warps me back to the roots of my fascination with flight. I was obsessed with the Granville Brothers’ air racing creations as a little kid. The whole period of aviation is as romantic as it gets, but the air racing circuit was a huge deal back then and men with nerves of steel climbed into aircraft that pushed the very edge of aerospace technology for the name of speed and glory. Now, nearly a century later, a recreation of the beast of all Gee Bees is for sale. It’s gorgeous. It’s flyable. It’s remarkably cheap. And most importantly, it needs a home. When you mention Gee Bee to anyone with a love of aviation, they probably think of the Z or R models. The Gee Bee Z was made famous all over again in 1991 via the film adaptation of the Rocketeer comic books. I absolutely loved this movie and still think it is sorely undervalued. It had so many things that stuck with me, from the fascination with the period and its Art Deco motif, to the legend of Howard Hughes, to some really great shooting locales, including Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Like a few other television shows and films of the era, the Rocketeer had a huge impact on what would become my interests as an adult and my eventual career path, but in a way that reinforced my passions more than anything else. I saw that movie on its premiere night in the incredible, but long-gone Fox Theater in Portland, Oregon with my dad. You couldn’t ask for a better setting for that film. Not too long after the Rocketeer made the Gee Bee famous again, Delmar Benjamin began flying his Gee Bee R2 recreation on the air show circuit. The R model Gee Bees were arguably the most famous, with Jimmy Doolittle winning the Thompson Trophy in Cleveland in 1932 while setting a new speed record in the Gee Bee R1. This was just one of the model’s many feats. National Archives Keep in mind that Gee Bees were awesomely powerful and aesthetically pleasing machines, but they were known as very tricky to fly at best and straight-up widow makers at worst. The fact that Benjamin and his R2 dispelled so much of that dark history by pulling off a remarkably intense air show routine and some outright thrilling air racing was also a game changer of sorts. Growing up being fascinated with the Gee Bee family and its lore was one thing, seeing it fly through the air first-hand was another. The fact that it really could do so much aerobatic work safely sort of opened up my curiosity when it came to investigating aerospace legend versus reality. The R2 has an approach speed of 145mph and a touchdown speed of 120mph! Delmar Benjamin’s R2 is seen here at Fantasy of Flight. , Greg Goebel/wikicommons For well over a decade, the R2 flew all over the United States and abroad with Benjamin at its controls and was an absolute star of the air show circuit. Eventually, it was retired and put on display at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida. Also housed there are a number of Gee Bees, including a flyable Z model . It was put back into the air after investigating the wing flutter issue that caused the original to crash, with Delmar Benjamin at the controls of course. So, suffice it to say, the Gee Bee family of planes is near and dear to my heart. That’s why it’s so exciting that there is another rare Gee Bee recreation that has had many of the design’s original issues solved and is fully flyable. Oh, and it can also carry a passenger! This aircraft is a modification of the biggest and last Gee Bee of them all, the R-6H model, also known as the Gee Bee Q.E.D., that traces its roots back to the Gee Bee R model. Only one Q.E.D. was ever built and it had a less than a spectacular racing career. The Granville Brothers built it for captain of industry Floyd Odlum who intended for his future wife, famed aviatrix Jacqueline Cochran , to fly it in the London-to-Sydney McRobertson Air Race. She didn’t get any farther than Romania when mechanical issues kept her on the ground. Beyond that, the R-6H never even completed any of the four Bendix and Thompson air races it was entered into. The R6H/Q.E.D. getting gassed prior to a race in the mid 1930s. , San Diego Air And Space Museum By the late 1930s, famed Mexican aviator Francisco Sarabia owned the aircraft, which he named “Conquistador del Cielo” (Conqueror of Heaven). He set out to set a number of speed-over-distance records with it. The big Q.E.D. was as much a touring machine as it was a pylon racer. On June 7th, 1939, while leaving to set a Washington, D.C. to Mexico City record from Bolling Field, the Q.E.D.’s engine quit when a rag left in the aircraft’s engine bay was sucked into its carburetor. The aircraft crashed into the Potomac River shortly after takeoff, killing Francisco Sarabia, but leaving the aircraft largely intact. It was later restored for display in Lerdo, Mexico as a memorial attraction to the famed flyer. Restored Q.E.D., Delosrjs/wikicommons Famed vintage aircraft recreator and restorer Jim Moss decided that the largest and last of the Granville Brothers racers could and should be brought back to life and improved upon. The result was Moss’s gorgeous Q.E.D. II that featured well over double the horsepower (675hp Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet vs 1,425hp Wright R-1820 Cyclone), 10 percent larger wing area, and a bigger vertical stabilizer and rudder, among other changes that made the aircraft far more stable and enjoyable to fly. So, calling it a ‘Super Q.E.D.’ also makes a lot of sense. After 50,000 man-hours of work, Moss’s creation took to the skies for the first time in 2013. Sadly, he was never able to see it fly. He died just weeks before it took to the air. Still, as the aircraft made its rounds, including to Oshkosh in 2014, where people were stunned with the quality of work that went into the aircraft. It was truly a work of flying art. Like the Q.E.D. of the past, two people can fly in this big-ass Gee Bee, meaning the joy of ripping through the heavens one of these historic flying hotrods can be shared with others. And the big race plane can travel over long distances, like its predecessor, so touring in the Q.E.D. II is very much a real possibility. This would make it uniquely well suited for hitting the air show circuit and letting as many people as possible enjoy it. Currently, the king of the Gee Bees is for sale for $899,000. This has to be a small fraction of what it cost to develop and build it and the aircraft is essentially brand new.

We also had an out of the blue follow-up to a story we broke years ago about a bizarre strike on an Al Qaeda terror boss in Syria. It turns out that just as we suspected it was done with an exotic low collateral damage weapon—a AGM-114 Hellfire with sword-like blades that pop out from its sides! We also posted the second part of our series with Paco, which took us from bombing in A-6s to dogfighting in F-14s and F-5s, and so much more. We also got news that the USAF is standing up a much needed F-35 aggressor squadron to keep pace with emerging threats. In addition, there were posts about shadowy submarine wake detection systems , new long-range missiles for the F-35 , our first look at one of the top contenders for the Navy’s future frigate tender, and so much more . Still, there was a ton of stuff we just couldn’t get to, but it’s not too late! Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to. In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk about this MH-60S all geared up to blast small boats in the Persian Gulf: Or what about this rarity?: There’s also the reality that the F-15X is already hard at work and it hasn’t even been ordered yet: Then there’s this Skycrane douching the hell out of a fire.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 14, 2020",USAF Fighter Pilots Are Now Flying With These Converted M4 Rifles In Their Survival Kits,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is now issuing new survival rifles, also known as the GAU-5/A Aircrew Self Defense Weapon , to at least some units. So we’re now beginning to get a better look at the gun, a variant of the AR-15/M16 pattern design , which has specialized features so it can break apart and fit compactly into the standard survival kit in an aviator’s ejection seat. On May 9, 2019 , the public affairs office for the 366th Fighter Wing, which flies F-15E Strike Eagles from Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, published a news item showing that the GAU-5/As are in service with its aircraft. In April 2019, a Facebook post showed that F-22 Raptor pilots with the 3rd Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska had also begun to fly with the Aircrew Self Defense Weapons (ASDW). In June 2018, the Air Force had revealed it was converting standard 5.56x45mm M4 carbines in-house to the new configuration at a rate of 100 per week, with a goal of producing 2,100 guns for distribution to combat-coded squadrons flying both fighter jets and bombers. “Thank you 673 SFS [Security Forces Squadron] for showing our F-22 leaders the new GAU-5,” U.S. Air Force Colonel Robert Davis, head of 3rd Wing, wrote in a post on the unit’s official Facebook page on Apr. 23, 2019 . “That will increase the firepower of our pilots if they ever have to eject over enemy territory!” The main difference between the ASDW and its M4 cousin is the redesign of the upper receiver to include a specialized locking system from Cry Havoc Tactical . With this lock in place, a user can attach or detach the barrel assembly from the rest of the gun without special tools. The North Carolina-headquartered firm says that, with proper training, a shooter can put the weapon together and be ready to fire within 60 seconds. A standard M4, above, and the GAU-5/A in its assembled configuration, below., USAF The GAU-5/A broken down and ready for stowage in the aircrew survival kit., USAF Pictures the Air Force has now released of the final ASDW configuration show that it also has a pistol grip that folds to the rear to make the lower receiver slimmer in order to fit better inside the survival kit. The gun also has folding iron sights to reduce its overall height. This all helps the gun fit snugly into the rest of the aircrew survival kit that goes under an Air Force pilot’s ejection seat. The complete kit weighs less than 40 pounds and also includes signal flares, a flashlight, a medical kit, survival tools, and a life raft. An airmen from the 366th Fighter Wing assembles a GAU-5/A., USAF A member of the 366th Fighter wing packs an aircrew survival kit. To the right, with the red protective cover, is the barrel assembly for the GAU-5/A., USAF Otherwise, the Air Force designed the ASDW so that it would be functionally identical to the M4 in its assembled form and use the same magazines. It has the same 14.5-inch overall barrel length, the same retractable buttstock, and the same general controls, such as the safety selector, magazine release, and charging handle. It also uses the same “ direct impingement ” operating system as the M4, which uses siphoned off propelling gas from firing the weapon to directly cycle the action. Sharing features and components with the existing M4 will certainly help with ease training and logistical requirements. Converting them from existing carbines could have offered a cost-saving alternative to buying entirely new guns, too. These factors seem to have influenced the development of the gun from start, which apparently began with a requirement from F-15E pilots out of Mountain Home. An F-15E Strike Eagle from the 366th Fighter Wing., USAF Heavily engaged in Iraq and Syria, the Strike Eagle pilots had demanded some sort of additional firepower over their 9mm M9 Beretta pistols in the event they had to bail out after witnessing what happened to Jordanian Air Force pilot Moaz Al Kasasbeh in December 2014. ISIS terrorists had quickly captured Al Kasasbeh after he crashed and they subsequently burned him alive in January 2015. Notably, after this incident, the Dutch Air Force began issuing its fighter pilots flying the Middle East a 9mm machine pistol to improve their ability to defend themselves. After Al Kasasbeh’s murder, the U.S. Air Force initially began inserting modified Vietnam War-era AR-15/M16 variants into survival kits. These guns are also confusingly known as the GAU-5/A , but have shorter barrels than the M4. “The weapon we ended up using was a GAU-5 because we already had it in the Air Force armory. We took what we had in the inventory, cut the barrel off at the iron sights and disassembled the upper and lower and put it in the seat kit, and it barely fit,” U.S. Air Force Technical Sergeant Paul Daggett, a Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialist at Mountain Home, said in an official interview in 2017. “Now you have a weapon with a better range that can keep him alive 3-4 hours for any kind of recovery to get in. So all the F-15s are flying with those in theatre and we’ve had contact from Germans, Australians, the Brits and they’re trying to copy our program that we initially started right here, so that’s pretty cool.” Airmen during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, including the two individuals at left with Vietnam War-era GAU-5/As., USAF The final decision to use a modified M4 design still seems curious in many ways, especially for such a relatively limited issue weapon. As noted, the Dutch settled on a very compact 9mm machine pistol for this role . If there were concerns about armor penetration, there are a number of purpose-built compact personal defense weapons on the market, such as the FN P90 or Heckler and Koch MP7 , which are already in service with the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Navy SEALs , respectively. The guns also use smaller, lighter ammunition than the 5.56x45mm cartridge, which would be a valuable feature when working within space and weight restrictions. Another alternative might have been to go with a compact version of the AR-15/M16 family, or a derivative thereof , using a specialized cartridge, such as .300 Blackout , to maximize performance with a shorter barrel. But the final GAU-5/A configuration does offer certain benefits over those weapons, including the already noted training and logistical commonality with the M4. That it retains the same 14.5-inch barrel length means that it has better range than a personal defense weapon and offers better armor penetration at appreciable distances compared to a compact pistol-caliber submachine gun . Whatever the exact reasoning behind the GAU-5/A’s selection was, increasingly more Air Force combat jet pilots are definitely now flying knowing that they’re sitting on additional firepower over their sidearms should they need it in a worst-case scenario.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 8, 2019",Fully Armed F-15Cs Have Arrived In The Middle East Amid Accusations Of Iranian Threats (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has deployed a contingent of F-15C Eagle fighter jets to the Middle East, sending them on their way carrying live missiles. This follows the arrival of four B-52H Stratofortress bombers and the early appearance in the Persian Gulf of the Nimitz -class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and her strike group, all ostensibly in response to still largely unclarified threats to American forces in the region from Iran and its proxies. On May 9, 2018 , Air Forces Central Command announced the arrival of the F-15Cs, which had occurred the day before, but offered few details, simply releasing photos showing two Eagles from the 48th Fighter Wing based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom taxing at an “undisclosed location” in Southwest Asia. One of the planes in the carried the name Deadpool, a reference to the Marvel Comics anti-hero , while the other had the nickname “Starscream” and the logo of the Decepticons , the villains of Transformers franchise, which involves sentient robots that can transform into various vehicles and aircraft. Starscream originally had the ability to transform into the likeness of an F-15. It is unclear how many Eagles the Air Force has deployed to the Middle East or may be planning to send in the near future. An F-15C Eagle nicknamed Starscream after arriving in the Middle East., USAF The released pictures also showed that the planes were carrying live weapon loads consisting of 6 AIM-120C Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and a pair of AIM-9X Sidewinder close-in dogfighting missiles. They also each carried an AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP) on the centerline, which offers a long-range visual identification capability for the F-15C, which you can read about more here . “U.S. Air Force fighter squadrons enhance regional partnerships and demonstrate a continued commitment to regional security and stability,” a caption to one of the photographs read. “These aircraft were moved within the theater to be best positioned to defend U.S. forces and interests in the region.” The pictures the Air Force released show the two jets carrying live AIM-120C and AIM-9X missiles., USAF It is worth noting that in February 2019 , the Air Force withdrew a contingent of F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and replaced them with F-15Cs. Two months later , the Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighters arrived at that same base marking the first time the service had operationally deployed these stealthy jets to the Middle East, but not as a replacement for the Eagles. As with other recent force deployments to the region, it is unclear as yet as to whether the deployment of the additional Eagles had already been scheduled to make a trip to the Middle East well in advance. Also on May 9, 2019 , two additional B-52Hs from the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisana arrived at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, bringing the total number of the bombers there to four. The first pair had begun their deployment two days earlier . The first two B-52Hs from the 2nd Bomb Wing sit on the ramp at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on May 8, 2019., USAF The USS Abraham Lincoln , and her associated strike group, is still sailing toward the Persian Gulf, transiting through the Red Sea on May 9, 2019. The carrier strike group was scheduled to deploy to the region, but after first conducting various activities in the Mediterranean Sea. On May 6, 2019, a statement from National Security Advisor John Bolton had announced that the ships would instead go directly to the Middle East. Separately, online plane spotters have noticed a recent flow of C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft from Europe heading toward the Persian Gulf, but it is unclear whether or not this is related to the recent deployments of aircraft and ships. The Air Force had only recently withdrawn B-1 Bone bombers from Al Udied and did so without any immediate plans for any new bombers to arrive to take their place. It could be that the service now needs to bring back a variety of personnel and supporting equipment again to sustain the new bomber operations. They could also be supporting the arrival of the F-15s from the United Kingdom or some entirely separate mission. The buildup is officially in response to intelligence that showed unspecified threats from Iran and its various regional proxies against American forces throughout the Middle East. Since Bolton’s initial announcement, media reports, citing unnamed sources have suggested that the intelligence came by way of Israel and that it involved details about the movement of ballistic missiles in the region by sea. It remains unclear who actually has been responding to who and whether or not Iran only began making its moves in the first place in response to U.S. actions. Tensions between the United States and Iran have already been steadily building in recent months. Notably, in April 2019 , the U.S. government designated all of Iran’s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organization, heaping even more sanctions on top of the group, which has ties to Iran’s controversial nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as international militant and terrorist networks. In response, Iran designated all U.S. military forces in the Middle East as terrorists , a largely symbolic gesture. Members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps., Sipa via AP Official statements from the Trump Administration, including Trump himself, have offered little additional clarity on the situation and the scope of the potential threats and just how imminent, or not, they actually are or might be. Iran, has, unsurprisingly, categorically denied the accusations, but its hostile position to the United States and its regional allies is no secret, nor is the fact that it supports a variety of terrorist and militant groups throughout the Middle East and elsewhere, who have targeted Americans and their allies over the years. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in an escalating series of threatening actions and statements in recent weeks. The response of the United States and our partners and allies has been clear: We do not seek war,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a statement on May 9, 2019 . “The regime in Tehran should understand that any attacks by them or their proxies of any identity against U.S. interests or citizens will be answered with a swift and decisive U.S. response.” At the same time, there is also no evidence, so far, that it, or its proxies, have made any new or particularly provocative moves as the U.S. government asserts. Some reports have suggested that American officials may be misinterpreting the intelligence and making whatever Iran is or isn’t doing out to be more an imminent concern than it actually is. In a May 9, 2019 interview with MSNBC , Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi specifically drew comparisons to the deliberate manipulation of intelligence in the run-up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations Majid Takht Ravanchi, then-Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for European and American Affairs, in 2016., Arnulf Stoffel/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images The mixed messaging goes beyond the military domain, as well. On May 8, 2019 , the Trump Administration his Iran’s metal industries with all new sanctions. This goes beyond the oil and other sanctions that had come back into force after Trump pulled out of the controversial Iran Deal over that country’s nuclear program in 2018. But the next day, the President took a more diplomatic tone, noting that he was often the one to “ temper ” National Security Advisor Bolton’s hawkish impulses. “What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump told reporters on May 9, 2019 . “We just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons – not too much to ask. And we would help put them back to great shape.” It should be noted that the Iran Deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), did put in place provisions that had prevented Iran from building nuclear weapons. All of the parties, including the United States, agreed that Iran was complying with this deal. The Trump Administration pulled out of the agreement based largely on the argument that it did not cover other worrisome activities, such as ballistic missile development , support for international terrorism , and domestic human rights in Iran. “No talks will be held with the Americans, and the Americans will not dare take military action against us,”  Yadollah Javani, the IRGC’s deputy head for political affairs, told the semi-official Tasnim news outlet in Iran on May 10, 2019 .  “Our nation… sees America as unreliable.” The growing concern now is that miscalculations and miscommunication from both the United States and Iran could lead them to stumble into a larger conflagration, one that could also potentially set off proxy conflicts in other countries where Iran has significant influence. Hardline elements in the country have now called for attacks on the Abraham Lincoln . There are been renewed threats to blockade the immensely important Strait of Hormuz, as well, which would have worldwide repercussions . But these rhetorical threats are well in line with years of Iranian posturing and bluster , which, so far, has yet to lead to actual major actions on their part, despite flamboyant military displays, including the destruction of a mock aircraft carrier during an exercise in 2015. Any conflict between the United States and Iran would be protracted and brutal, but it seems hard to see how the Iranian military could actually win a stand-up fight against its American counterparts and, by and large, they seem to know it . Going as far as to close off the Strait of Hormuz could easily do as much, if not more damage, to Iran’s economy as anyone else. https://youtube.com/watch?v=CkbS4BQxTgg Iran’s very real capabilities, including shore-launched anti-ship cruise missiles, ballistic missiles that may have anti-ship capabilities , naval mines , submarines , small manned and unmanned boats able to conduct swarming attacks , and more, are more intended to make the price the United States would have to pay in any conflict too unbearable to contemplate. This is all bolstered by the added threat of cyber attacks or the use of proxies to conduct terrorist attacks far from any battlefield. All told, the entire situation seems as nebulous as ever. Trump’s comments regarding Bolton only seem to fuel the previous speculation that the National Security Advisor might be trying to goad Iran into responding and providing a pretext for a more forceful American response. “[Bolton] has strong views on things, but that’s O.K,” Trump said on May 9, 2019 . “I have John Bolton and I have other people who are a little more dovish and ultimately I make the decision.” So far, this exchange of ideas in the White House has led to a surge of U.S. forces into the Middle East, but with little apparent explanation as to their ultimate purpose. Update: 5:55pm EST— Voice Of America has reported a new set of force changes and deployments to the Middle East. This includes the arrival of the San Antonio-class landing platform dock amphibious ship USS Arlington in the Persian Gulf and the U.S. Army sending a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery to an undisclosed location. “USS Arlington will be replacing the USS Fort McHenry already in the region,” VOA Carla Babb Tweeted out. “It will be providing additional command and control capability in the region, says sr. military official. Would not say where Patriot is being deployed.” USS Arlington and USS Fort McHenry are both part of the Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group , which also includes the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. That Arlington was not already in the Persian Gulf with Kearsarge actually points to that ship potentially having been operating off the coast of Libya, where U.S. Marines landed in early April 2019 to help other American personnel evacuate in the face of heavy fighting in and around the country’s capital Tripoli. If Fort McHenry is now leaving, that ship may be moving back into the Mediterranean to take up station off Libya, where things also remain very much in flux. The U.S. military had Patriot missile units deployed in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Jordan until withdrawing them in late 2018 to meet order to reposition them to be better aligned with the Pentagon’s renewed focus on a potential large-scale conflict with a major opponent, such as Russia or China. The redeployment of a single battery would not return the United States to the posture it had had last year, though the U.S. military could decide to deploy additional systems in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 23, 2021",U.S. Navy Has Stopped Looking For Japan’s Crashed F-35 That Remains Largely Unrecovered,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy says it has concluded its support of search and recovery efforts related to a Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter that crashed off the coast of that country last month . The Japanese are continuing to look for parts of the plane, including its flight data recorder, as well as the pilot, who remains missing. The Navy’s 7th Fleet made the announcement on May 8, 2019 . At that time, the service’s only assets aid in the search and recovery operation were a salvage team on board a chartered deep sea construction vessel, Ultra Deep Solutions’ Van Gogh . Between Apr. 9, 2019, when the F-35A first went missing, and Apr. 17, 2019, the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Stethem and a pair of P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft had also contributed to the search efforts, collectively covering a total area of more than 5,000 square nautical miles. A U.S. Air Force U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane had also conducted at least one sortie over the area and it is not clear if that service is still assisting with the search and recovery missions. The salvage team on Van Gogh had deployed the Cable-controlled Undersea Recovery Vehicle 21, or CURV-21 , a remotely operated vehicle, to survey the seabed near where searchers had already found debris. This is a 6,400-pound system that can operate at depths up to 20,000 deep. It has its own sonar to help detect objects of interest and still and full motion video cameras to gather imagery. Operators can equip it with various tool and grabbing arms as required to actually manipulate or recover objects it finds. The Navy had also deployed the CURV-21 in 2017 to help search for the submarine ARA San Juan after its tragic accident . The naval salvage unit had also brought a Towed Pinger Locator 25, or TPL-25 . Dragged behind a ship, this system can reportedly detect pings from certain emergency systems on aircraft at depths of up to 25,000 feet. The CURV-21 would have been able to further investigate any signals the TPL-25 picked up. On Apr. 8, 2019, Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told the Diplomatic and Defense Affairs Committee of Japan’s parliament, or Diet, that the U.S. Navy had been responsible for recovering at least a portion of the F-35A’s flight data recorder. “The Defense Ministry is studying [the parts], but at this point, the all-important memory [of the flight data recorder] has not been recovered,” he said, according to The Diplomat . It’s entirely unclear whether Iwaya meant that technicians had not yet been able to access the data or if it was somehow physically missing. It seems hard to understand how the data within the flight recorder could otherwise be missing. It is possible that the “black box” suffered severe damage during the crash, but it seems curious that the Defense Minister would not have simply said so if that were the case. One of Japan’s F-35As., JASDF “We will continue our search and recovery for the pilot and the aircraft that are still missing, while doing our utmost to determine the cause,” Iwaya added . He added that the Japan Air Self-Defense Force was continuing to use its own small search and rescue boats, as well as a private salvage ship, to continue looking for the rest of the F-35A and its pilot, Major Akinori Hosomi. Iwaya said that the Kaimei , a Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology deep-sea research vessel, had also stopped supporting the operation, but not before helping locate the F-35A’s canopy and other debris. The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force’s (JMSDF) JS Chiyoda , a submarine rescue ship, had also been part of the initial search and recovery effort, but appears to have left the area, as well. Though Japanese and American officials have downplayed the concerns , the downed F-35A remains a potential security risk. Joint Strike Fighters are made with classified materials and sensitive manufacturing science. Even small parts could just offer valuable industrial intelligence. There is a possibility that other foreign actors, such as Russia or China, could seek to locate the crash site or related debris fields and retrieve portions of the stealth fighter, which could offer valuable intelligence. Russia just recently added to its already particularly extensive fleet of special projects submarines capable of deep-sea work, including the possible ability to deploy their own manned and unmanned deeper-diving submersibles. Debris has already come to the surface, including the aircraft’s tail, too. As time goes on, currents could take that very far from the initial crash site. This could all complicate any decision to declare an end to the search and recovery efforts without securing the majority of the plane. Japanese authorities have not yet given any firm date for when the mission will end. The U.S. Navy, however, has clearly decided that its services are no longer required.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 10, 2019",F-35 Aggressor Squadron To Be Activated At Nellis Air Force Base (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force is reactivating the 65th Aggressor Squadron (65th AGRS) at Nellis Air Force Base and it is getting a game-changing and badly needed new aggressor capability in the form of the F-35A Panther . The news was confirmed to us after we reached out to Nellis Air Force Base’s public affairs. Here is there official statement to from Maj. Chris Sukach, Nellis Air Force Base spokesperson: “Nellis Air Force Base looks forward to reactivating the 65th Aggressor Squadron with the F-35A. This added capability will enhance the already robust adversary replication provided to U.S. and partner nation Air Forces through multiple training and exercise scenarios.” F-35s line the ramp at Nellis AFB., Nellis AFB Public Affairs Reactivating the 65th Aggressor Squadron is a huge coup for Nellis and Air Combat Command as a whole. The 65th AGRS has a rich history and was stood up with F-15C/Ds in 2005 to augment the still very active 64th Aggressor Squadron and their Block 32 F-16C/D Vipers by adding a higher performance threat representation capability with a more powerful radar system. By all accounts, the 65th AGRS more than accomplished this task and were notorious for giving Blue Force aircrews a run for their money during exercises like Red Flag and Weapon School evolutions . They also worked with other units at Nellis AFB and at other bases to help develop new tactics and procedures for overcoming ever-evolving enemy capabilities abroad. The squadron was first truncated in size from its height of 19 aircraft as a result of sequestration in the early part of this decade. Then it was announced that the unit would be shuttered in 2014 as part of a sweeping plan to cut operational costs across the USAF due to tightening budgets. You can read my editorial on the loss of this squadron from 2014 by clicking here . Since then, the USAF’s 64th Aggressor Squadron at Nellis AFB and the 18th Aggressor Squadron in Alaska, which also flies F-16s, have been the entire service’s only dedicated aggressor units. 65th Aggressor Squadron F-15D high over the northern reaches of the Nellis Range complex. , Tyler Rogoway/Author Much has changed since the 65th flew its last Red Air mission. The rapid rise of peer state threats from China and Russia, not to mention the proliferation of stealth technology, have largely changed the Pentagon’s calculus when it comes to being ready for ‘the next war.’ As a result, there have been rumors that a new aggressor squadron could be in the works, in particular, one equipped with stealthy F-35s—possibly early block aircraft that will be too costly to upgrade into fully combat coded jets. After posting my interview with Nellis Air Force Base commander General Robert Novotny, I followed up with a question about bringing the F-35A online as an aggressor asset. At the time, he said that such an idea was a work in progress and nothing had been decided. Well, now it looks like Novotny and his comrades in the aggressor community have succeeded in making this a reality. And thank goodness they did. An interesting look at an F-35A in a dark charcoal Chinese aggressor scheme. , 57th Wing Commander’s Facebook Page The inconvenient and unpopular truth is that the Air Force, and the Navy too for that matter, have atrophied when it comes to keeping up with successfully presenting the latest aerial threats in air combat training. The people who do this mission are incredibly talented and dedicated, and folding in cyber and electronic warfare into the overall aggressor mission space has been very effective and important. But these people can only do so much with dated airframes that benefit from the infrequent insertion of unique technologies , at best. China’s stealth fighter is operational —or semi-operational depending on who you ask—and they have another in flight testing , as well as two stealth bombers deep in development , and are working on a number of stealth drones . Russia’s less stealthy, but still advanced Su-57 fighter is now being pitched to anyone with the hard cash to participate in the program and Moscow is also looking to stealthy drones when it comes to future air combat capabilities. This is nothing to be said of stealthy cruise missiles, which are easier to develop or procure and employ. So yes, the USAF needs a new aggressor platform to help replicate these emerging threats and possibly using a handful of old stealth aircraft and newer stealthy target drones will not do the trick alone. The F-35, on the other hand, will, and much, much more. J-20, China’s heavy stealth fighter, bristling with missiles. , Chinese Internet The F-35’s ability to play the bad guy will surpass that of any aircraft ever tasked with the mission before. The aircraft is uniquely suited to replicate a wide range of threats with unprecedented high fidelity. I have talked with sources about this in the past and they have noted that the F-35’s software alone should be able to be manipulated to replicate the sensor, sensor fusion, electronic warfare, and communications capabilities of adversary threats. In other words, applications could be designed to limit various aspects of the F-35’s capabilities—and enhance others synthetically via data-link—to better mirror that of the aircraft it is masquerading as. In addition, it can be equipped with bolt-on radar reflectors that may be able to be manipulated to better replicate certain radar signatures of enemy aircraft, including those that aren’t even stealthy at all. So, we are talking about an aggressor iPhone here compared to the flip phones of the past. One day it can be a Su-35, the next a J-20, and the next it can replicate an enemy stealth bomber on a nuclear strike mission, and do so potentially with unprecedented fidelity. The Panther’s integrated electronic warfare system could also allow the F-35 to mimic the bad guy in various ways and provide the ability to fool allied sensor systems. In particular, the F-35’s little known, but hugely important advanced towed decoy system could give the aircraft the ability to appear as something, or some things, it is not one moment and disappears entirely the next. An F-35 landing at Nellis AFB under some ominous clouds. , Nellis AFB Public Affairs All told, the F-35’s ability to manipulate its own signature should prove to be a major advantage when it comes to giving fleet pilots a real look at what the bad guy may show up like during actual combat. The USAF really did the right thing here in pushing the F-35 into the aggressor role and bringing back the squadron that has the perfect pedigree for making it happen. It shows that they are coming to terms with the real threat posed by America’s adversaries in the decade to come and that the aggressor mission is absolutely key to confronting it. Also, this decision highlights how the Air Force is truly creating a robust high-medium-low capability aggressor mix with the help of throngs of contractor adversary support jets . We still don’t know the timeline for standing up this unit, but it will surely take time to realize. We will keep you up to date as more information about this exciting development comes available. UPDATE: 6:45pm PDT— The USAF has now put out a release on the news. We were correct, they will be repurposing early-build jets for this role. Nine of them to start, all of which will come from Eglin AFB in Florida. Eglin is the schoolhouse for USAF F-35 training. This is probably a good thing because they can get creative and modify these jets specifically for the mission as they will never see combat. Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson states: “This move will allow us to repurpose early production F-35s to help train Airmen for the high end fight.” The release is not precise in its wording, but the aircraft may not be transferred until 2022, when new planes will replace them at Eglin. You can see the confusing statement below: Aircraft transferring from Eglin AFB to Nellis AFB will not occur until newly produced aircraft arrive at Eglin AFB to replace them. New aircraft are planned to arrive at Nellis AFB beginning in early 2022. This is in line with our thinking that standing up a unit like this as the force is trying to expand its front-line F-35 force will be more protracted than doing so with 4th generation fighters. It will also allow time for industry and the USAF to figure out the unique aggressor configuration for these jets.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 10, 2019",Secret Hellfire Missile With Sword-Like Blades Made Mysterious Strike On Terror Leader In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency, are reportedly using a specialized version of the ubiquitous Hellfire missile that swaps out the explosive warhead for inert ballast and an array of sword-like blades that pop out right before it impacts its target. The weapon is designed to give the U.S. government a way to target individual terrorists and militants with an extremely low chance of collateral damage, even to individuals very close by. It was reportedly the weapon responsible for killing Al Qaeda’s then-number two leader, Abu Khayr Al Masri, as he drove in Syria in 2017, a strike that clearly involved some sort of mysterious munition, something that The War Zone was the first to call attention to. The Wall Street Journal published its scoop of the weapon, reportedly designated the AGM-114R9X, on May 9, 2019. Anonymous U.S. government sources told the newspaper that the U.S. military had only fired them operationally “about a half-dozen times,” but had done so against targets in Libya , Syria , Iraq, Yemen , and Somalia. It is unclear whether this includes CIA-directed strikes that have utilized the missile. The exact configuration of the R9X variant is unclear and the Journal was not able to obtain any pictures of it with its blades either stowed or deployed as they would be before impact. A diagram the newspaper put together from descriptions it received, which you can see below, shows the blades extending out laterally from the warhead section of the missile. The six-bladed configuration has reportedly earned the nicknames “ninja bomb” and “the flying Ginsu,” the latter being a reference to a brand of knives sold through television infomercials starting in the 1970s. The advertisements featured energetic pitchmen slicing through everything from fruits and vegetables to wood blocks and commercial plastic piping. The standard AGM-114R, which has been in production since 2010, features an armor-penetrating warhead wrapped in a fragmentation sleeve that gives it a multi-purpose capability against both armored vehicles and soft targets. Since its introduction, a number of subvariants have also become available. This includes the R2 version that adds in a “height of burst” capability that detonates the warhead approximately three feet from the impact point, creating an airburst effect. There is also an R1, R3, R8, and R13 variants, details of which do not appear to be readily available, and an R5 type specifically for export to U.S. allies and partners. A chart showing details of various common AGM-114 variants, including the AGM-114R., US Army There are at least four other versions of the R9 subvariant, as well. “Their [Air Force Special Operations Command’s] Hellfire variant, AGM-114R9, has an extremely low collateral damage warhead,” according to the October 2018 edition of The Precision Strike Digest , the official publication of the Precision Strike Association. U.S. Special Operations Command introduced the R9E in 2014 and the R9H in 2016, and there is also reportedly an R9G variant, but there is no additional information on the differences between them. A slide regarding U.S. Special Operations Command’s Hellfire inventory as of 2016., SOCOM Some sources have indicated that the R9E has a “Low Collateral Damage” warhead, while the R9H is an improved “Very Low Collateral Damage” type. However, General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems builds the warhead for the R9E and describes it as an “advanced blast fragmentation warhead [that] penetrates and defeats a suite of diverse targets,” which would seem to contradict this. At the same time, the U.S. Air Force has applied the “low collateral damage” description to blast-fragmentation munitions that simply have a reduced explosive filler. A screengrab from General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems’ website’s entry on the R9E warhead., GD-OTS It is possible that the entire R9 sub-series is focused on ways to reduce the risk of collateral damage. Another R9 variant may even have an entirely inert warhead, which would already reduce the risk of collateral damage substantially, while the R9X adds in the blades to help increase kill probability. At the time of the Al Masri strike, without knowing the exact weapon involved, The War Zone noted that using a small munition with an inert warhead would increase the risk of failure, especially against a moving target, given that it would need to be very precisely hit the individual in question. The move to add sharp protrusions to the inert Hellfire design would seem to confirm these limitations. There are also no details on the launch platforms involved, but The War Zone previously laid out a detailed case for CIA involvement in the Al Masri strike using a shadowy fleet of General Atomics Avenger drones, which you can read here . There are some indications as to who may be flying the drones , whether they are Avengers or Reapers, as well. But manned coalition aircraft do not operate in that area of Western Syria and the Journal says it confirmed the CIA at least directed that mission. It is worth noting that the basic concept of using precision-guided munitions with inert warheads, often referred to as “ concrete bombs ,” to help mitigate the chances of collateral damage for targeted strikes is hardly new. The U.K. Royal Air Force used inert precision-guided bombs in the opening phases of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the French Air Force did the same in Libya in 2011 . The U.S. Air Force has also since developed a number of other specialized low-collateral damage bombs . The particular impetus for the development of the R9X was as an alternative option to a ground assault to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, according to the Journal . The Al Qaeda founder was regularly surrounded by family members, including women and children, presenting a need for extreme precision in any possible air strike. The specialized Hellfire could have made it easier to confirm Bin Laden’s death, including through subsequent DNA collection, something that U.S. personnel reportedly did following the 2011 raid. Though special operators ultimately conducted that raid and killed Bin Laden, development of the ninja bomb Hellfire continued, spurred on additionally by President Barack Obama’s new rules in 2013 for mitigating collateral damage in strikes outside officially declared war zones. One of the Journal ‘s sources said that the missile remained an important tool for addressing what they described as a “right seat, left seat” issue. The story suggested this could imply the ultimate goal is for an air-launched weapon that can kill a specific individual in car or truck without injuring anyone else, but it seems more likely that it was a figurative expression. The video below shows just how much potential risk there is for collateral damage when using a standard Hellfire missile against an individual target. https://youtube.com/watch?v=rB1LzNUO1FU The Journal says the strike that killed Al Masri in Syria in 2017 was one of the two it was able to confirm that involved one of these bladed missiles. But in this case, the weapon killed Al Masri and the individual seated next to him in his Kia sedan. The only other example of an R9X use that the Journal could verify was the January 1, 2019 strike that killed Jamal Al Badawi , the alleged mastermind of the bombing of the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. Badawi was driving alone at the time, making it impossible to assess whether the weapon could have killed him while leaving other occupants unscathed. It is also worth noting that there were have previously been reports that President Donald Trump received a briefing prior to the strike against Al Masri on a highly specialized air-dropped munition intended to avoid civilian casualties, which would match the general description of the R9X, and that he was reportedly unimpressed. It is unclear if this has had any impact at all on the weapon’s apparently highly limited use. But the R9X’s highly classified nature might just mean that its production remains extremely limited, leading to limited use and only by select crews familiar with its design and how to employ it properly. The aforementioned inherent limitations of these kinds of weapons with inert warheads, in general, might also reduce the instances where it is a practical option. A satellite image of a testing site near Yucca Flat in the Nevada Test Site’s Area 6. Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor behind the Hellfire, tests exotic weapons payloads for drones here., Google Earth But if the United States continues to prosecute targeted strikes against terrorists and militants, there will continue to be at least some demand for munitions such as the AGM-114R9X to mitigate the risks of collateral damage as much as possible. Having such a weapon can only expand the engagement windows for those strikes given the reduced hazard to other individuals, even those relatively close by to the target. The emergence of the R9X certainly answers the questions The War Zone had posed after the Al Masri strike. That it has been in development for nearly a decade and is just becoming public knowledge now points to the high likelihood that there are other exotic munitions still in the classified realm that have yet to come out into the light.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2019",News Of Sanction Busting North Korean Cargo Ship Seized As Kim Fires More Missiles (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After a year and a half without any major North Korean missile launches, Kim Jong Un’s regime has now fired three missiles with over-the-horizon range in the space of a week . These newest tests came right before the U.S. government’s disclosure that it has taken the unprecedented step of seizing a North Korean ship over sanctions violations for the first time ever, and has been holding the ship for more than a month now, something that is almost certain to prompt a response from North Korea, if Pyongyang hasn’t started to do so already . The latest launches occurred at 4:29 PM and 4:39 PM local time on the Korean Peninsula on May 9, 2019. The two missiles flew from Kusong, situated north of the Sino-Ri missile base on North Korea’s west coast and impacted into the East Sea. The first missile flew approximately 260 miles, while the second traveled almost 168 miles, according to South Korean officials. “Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance in case of a further launch from North Korea, and has maintained a full-fledged posture in close coordination with the United States,” a statement from South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. South Korean officials have no said what type of missiles were involved in this latest test. The different flight distances could mean that North Korea fired two different types in this latest test. However, experts have said that reports that the weapons only flew to a maximum altitude of just over 30 miles, which strongly suggests that at least one of these missiles was the same as the one North Korea tested on May 3, 2019. That test also involved long-range rocket artillery. The North Koreans have since released pictures and video of the short-range missile, which is visually similar to Russia’s Iskander quasi-ballistic missile , as well as South Korea’s Hyunmoo-2 . North Korea first paraded what appears to have been a mockup of these weapons in February 2018. The imagery from the earlier test shows various key differences and slightly different transporter-erector-launcher, the latter of which is similar in general appearance to the one Russia employs with the Iskander . A photograph from the May 3, 2019 missile test., KCNA Mockups of the missile on parade in 2018., KCNA Questions remain as to whether or not North Korea’s new missile has any of the same advanced features as Iskander. The Russian weapon has a satellite navigation-assisted guidance package that helps it course correct after launch for greater precision. Its maneuverability, together with its relatively low quasi-ballistic flight envelope, is also intended to make it more difficult to intercept. If North Korea’s weapon has any sort of similar capabilities, it could be a particularly important development for the country in the face of growing U.S. and South Korean missile defenses. North Korea described the May 3 event as a “routine and self-defensive military drill,” adding that “the recent drill conducted by our army is nothing more than part of the regular military training, and it has neither targeted anyone nor led to an aggravation.” However, it’s hard not to see these latest missile tests as anything but an expression of Kim Jong Un’s frustration at continued U.S. sanctions in the wake of the collapse of his summit with U.S. President Trump last year and a noticeable slowdown in progress on diplomatic and economic endeavors with South Korea. Separately, on May 9, 2019 , the U.S. Department of Justice made a huge announcement that it had seized a North Korean ship over sanctions violations for the very first time, as well. For more than a year now, the regime in Pyongyang has been actively conducting at-sea transfers of sanctioned goods, such as coal, from its ships to neutral vessels in order to skirt the prohibitions. American authorities had taken control of the M/V Wise Honest , one of North Korea’s largest bulk cargo ships, on or about Apr. 2, 2019, but had not previously disclosed it had done so. There is no indication that North Korea had publicly acknowledged the seizure, either, but it is not hard to see how it could have contributed to Kim’s already increasingly belligerent posture as of late. The formal announcement seems almost certain to prompt at least fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un observes the drills on May 3, 2019, which included a launch of a short-range ballistic missile., KCNA South Korean President Moon Jae In, who has spent a significant amount of resources and political capital in trying to usher in a new era of peace and engagement with North Korea, has sought to downplay the latest missile tests at least. “I want to tell North Korea once again that it’s not ideal to repeat actions that … risk throwing cold water on the atmosphere of dialogue and negotiations,” he said in an interview with South Korea’s KBS television. But, especially with U.S. Special Representative Stephen Biegun in South Korea right now for talks with Moon’s government, it’s hard not to see the new launches as anything but another indicator that North Korea may be heading into a new period of “missile diplomacy.” The May 3 test had also followed a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had recently met with North Korea’s Kim. Trump and Putin reportedly discussed humanitarian aid for the North and other issues related to Pyongyang. On May 4, 2019, Trump Tweeted out a message that had also seemed to downplay the earlier missile test. This was a significant statement given the U.S. president’s repeated comments about how the U.S. government might respond forcefully if North Korea were to abandon its self-imposed moratorium on the testing of long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons . “Anything in this very interesting world is possible, but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea, & will do nothing to interfere or end it,” Trump said in his social media post. “He [Kim] also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!” Trump made similar comments to reporters after the latest missile tests. He also did not mention the U.S. government’s seize of the Wise Honest . “Well, we’re looking at it very seriously right now. They were smaller missiles, short-range missiles,” Trump said outside the White House on May 9, 2019. “Nobody’s happy about it, but we’re taking a good look, and we’ll see, we’ll see.” “The relationship continues, but we’ll see what happens,” Trump continued. “I know they want to negotiate, they’re talking about negotiating. But I don’t think they’re ready to negotiate.” But, by all indications, Kim, who has been adamant about securing the removal of all sanctions against his country before moving on any other issues, looks less and less content for negotiations to muddle along at their current speed. The firing of short-range missiles is clearly intended to avoid breaking Pyongyang’s stated testing moratorium, and seems to offer useful room to the country’s opponents to avoid dangerous escalation, but if the launches do not achieve the desired effect, Kim may feel the need to step things up. All told, it seems increasingly likely, at least in the near term, that if Kim doesn’t see the kind of progress he wants in sanctions relief or other negotiations with the United States and South Korea that missile launches could once again become a more routine occurrence. This could include the launching of larger, more threatening missiles and other provocative actions that would be too much for the U.S. and South Korean government’s to ignore. Update: 5:30pm EST— North Korea has released imagery of the latest missile test, confirming that it did involve the same short-range missile as the May 3, 2019 launch. However, what is interesting is that this new launch involved the use of a tracked transport-erector-launcher, or TEL, rather than a wheeled one in either of the two previous configurations. This new transporter erector launch otherwise looks very similar to the improved wheeled one that emerged on May 3, with a similar cab design, but it is visibly distinct. Tracked TELs are less common than wheeled ones for ballistic missiles, but are hardly unheard of. North Korea also has a tracked TEL for the Pukguksong-2 , or KN-15, ballistic missile, which is a derivative of the solid-fuel Pukguksong-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile, also known as the KN-11.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 2, 2021",Royal Navy Sub Appears In Gibraltar Equipped With A Wake Detection System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.K. Royal Navy’s Trafalgar -class attack submarine HMS Talent has emerged in the British territory of Gibraltar equipped with what appears to be a specialized system to detect hostile subs without using sonar. The concept of using various sensors to pick up the non-acoustic signatures of other submarines is hardly new , but Talent ’s added equipment follows years of reports of increasing underwater activity from potential opponents, such as Russia and China , in both the Atlantic and the Pacific , among other bodies of water . It also comes as both of those countries continue to develop and deploy quieter nuclear-powered and advanced diesel-electric subs . Photographer David Parody grabbed some great pictures of Talent as she entered the Bay of Gibraltar on May 8, 2019. Observers were quick to spot the never before seen piece of equipment on top of the forward hull. Parody subsequently found another picture of the same boat from April 2019, showing the system installed. However, he said she had lacked the apparent sensor arrangement during another visit in 2018, which followed an extensive refit, suggesting the addition was relatively recent. HMS Talent in the Bay of Gibraltar on May 8, 2019. The apparent non-acoustic sensor system is visible on top of the front of the hull., DM Parody ( https://www.dotcom.gi/photos ) A view of the other side of Talent ., DM Parody ( https://www.dotcom.gi/photos ) Talent in Gibraltar in 2018 without the apparent sensor system., DM Parody ( https://www.dotcom.gi/photos ) It’s not clear whether the new addition is permanent, either. Talent is the second to last of the Trafalgar -class submarines, having gotten commissioned in 1990, and one of only three of them left in service. The Royal Navy plans to decommission her in 2021 as it phases out the entire class in favor of the newer Astute -class . The system has four individual probes in front and is visually reminiscent of features most commonly seen on multiple types of Soviet and now Russian submarines . Though there are various different configurations with their own specific nomenclature, these are commonly referred to collectively as System Obnarujenia Kilvaternovo Sleda (SOKS), which translates Wake Object Detection System. SOKS allows these submarines to detect underwater opponents without using sonar, but more on that later. A close-up of the new addition to HMS Talent ., DM Parody (https://www.dotcom.gi/photos) An even closer view., DM Parody ( https://www.dotcom.gi/photos ) Long the default for submarine warfare, sonar still has certain limitations. Modern sonar systems typically have both active and passive functionality. In their active mode, they operate similarly to radar above the waves, but use acoustic energy instead of RF energy, sending out “pings” that then bounce off objects undersea and on the surface. The passive functionality gives operators the option to just listen for certain noises in relation to their surroundings using the system’s highly sensitive and largely omnidirectional receivers. However, active sonar can quickly give away a submarine’s position, while the passive mode may pick up all manner of background sounds and is impacted by the constantly changing ocean environment around the submarine. The two videos below give a good sense of the factors involved. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_S9wRl9zpw0 https://youtube.com/watch?v=44N5Z2e_M4Y The thing is, staying silent is essential to a submarine’s survival. Over the years, major navies around the world have invested significant time and resources into the development of quieter types, using either nuclear powerplants or diesel-electric systems with advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems, among a host of other sound-dampening features . Trying to “hear” the most advanced designs using passive sonar could be especially difficult and “pinging” with active sonar might often be too risky an option. This is where systems such as SOKS come in. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7L8pKSfJc88 There is very little hard detail on exactly how these systems work, but the name seems to make clear that they at least have the ability to sense changes in water density that submarines make as they sail underwater. A number of modern torpedoes use guidance systems with similar “ wake-homing ” technology to find their targets without relying on their own sonars, which can get jammed or confused by decoys. A screengrab showing SOKS equipment on the Russian Akula II -class submarine Vepr , also known as K-157., RT screengrab But reports say that components of SOKS may also be able to pick up various chemicals that submarines leave in their wakes, including temporary anti-corrosive coatings and byproducts from oxygen generation systems. They may also be able to pick up minute amounts of radiation from nuclear-powered submarines or detect the slight warming of patches of water from being in contact with a warmer submarine. The United States first became aware of SOKS in 1969, when it spotted K-14, a November -class nuclear-attack submarine, equipped with an early version of the system. Still, by the 1970s , American intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency , were dismissive about its potential capabilities, suggesting it had extremely limited range and sensitivity. As late as the 1990s , at least some members of the U.S. military were still of the opinion that “whether or not hydrodynamic phenomena [wakes] are exploitable is open to question.” SOKS equipment seen on an early Akula -class submarine., via Popular Mechanics The U.S. Navy had itself explored many of these techniques around the same time to Soviets did, but abandoned them in favor of advances in sonar. The Soviet Union was not making the same kind of progress in sonar, forcing them to explore alternatives. But the persistence of SOKS in Russian Navy service suggests there have been meaningful advances in this technology. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), as well as Chinese research institutions, have also been re-evaluating sonar alternatives more recently , which only further supports this conclusion. Improvements in sensor technology, real-time processing, and raw computing power could certainly have helped make these sorts of non-acoustic systems more practical. Just like sonar systems, SOKS and similar equipment would still need very specific processing systems to be able to help separate the signature of an enemy submarine from any naturally occurring chemical concentrations and hydrodynamic phenomena and provide operators with reliable information. One can imagine that by sampling the water for a number of submarine-related anomalies, a system could give crews a better idea of the likelihood that a real submarine has been detected and it could possibly help classify the target based on a library of sample data. Once detection occurs, tracking is also a real possibility. The system could also be used for tracking alone, once a target is detected by other means. The Royal Navy’s outfitting of Talent with what appears to be non-acoustic sensors isn’t even the first time a Trafalgar -class submarine has emerged with such a system, either. Another Trafalgar -class boat had appeared in the past with a similar set of equipment mounted on the front and sides of her sail. This is not necessarily surprising. Since at least 2017, there has been a steady flow of reports from the U.S. military and NATO members highlighting increased Russian Chinese submarine activity in both the Atlantic and Pacific . The Russians have also notably increased their underwater operations in the Arctic region, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and Baltic Sea . At the same time, both countries have been working hard to expand the size, scope , and capabilities of their submarine fleets . None of this is to say that sonar is in danger of going away, but it may be increasingly the case that submarines will have to rely on a broader array of sensors to find their targets or avoid enemy threats. The non-acoustic component could serve as a short-range tool for silently keeping tabs on a target submarine and potentially allow operators to identify and log specific signatures in the process. All told, Talent ’s new equipment may stand out now as unusual, but there could be a growing demand for non-acoustic sensors as time goes on, especially if the technology has truly proven itself to be mature and reliable. Correction: The original version of this story said that there were four Trafalgar -class submarines still in service, when there are only three at present. It also said that HMS Trafalgar had appeared with a different apparent wake-homing system in 2018, when that submarine was out of service in 2009.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2019",Canada’s CF-18 Replacement Competition Structure Seems To Have Already Disqualified The F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada is hoping to finally issue its new request for bids on a contract to supply the Royal Canadian Air Force with 88 new fighter jets to replace that service’s aging CF-18A/B Hornets later this month. The county’s fighter jet replacement plans turned into a saga long ago that has now lasted more than a decade , but the new plan looks set to create even more problems and controversy. A specific requirement regarding industrial offsets in the request could force Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter out of the running from the start for the somewhat obtuse reason that Canada is already, technically, a member of that program. The Canadian government issued a draft request for proposals in October 2018 . The country subsequently “pre-qualified” four planes as potential competitors for the deal, worth approximately $14 billion . These were the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , the Eurofighter Typhoon , Lockheed Martin’s F-35, and the Saab Gripen . As part of this pre-qualification process, Canadian authorities had reached out to the U.S. military’s F-35 Joint Program Office, which manages international cooperation on the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) with Lockheed Martin, to clarify various points ahead of the competition. The main issue centers on the extent of Canada’s continued obligations under what is known as the JSF Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding. To rewind quickly, Canada has been a member of the F-35 program from the very beginning, but initially only as a so-called “ Level 3 ” industrial partner without a firm commitment to buy any actual aircraft. This helped Canadian firms secure dozens of contracts related to the Joint Strike Fighter’s development and production, which, to date, have been worth a combined total of more than $1.3 billion. It also means that Canadian companies remain eligible to bid on F-35-related contracts throughout the service life of the aircraft. US Air Force F-35As during a recent training exercise., USAF In 2010, Canada’s Conservative Party government announced plans to purchase 65 F-35s. The process moved slowly and was the subject of much criticism from opposition parties. When the Liberal Party won elections in 2015, incoming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to scrap the deal and recompete the contract. Plans to purchase a smaller number of “interim” fighter jets have come up against a trade dispute and other issues, turning into a saga of their own, which you can read about more here . But documents that various Canadian media outlets and think tanks have now obtained, show that the country’s membership in the F-35 program could actually upend any possibility of purchasing those aircraft. The U.S. military has apparently been adamant that it can’t allow the JSF to take part in Canada’s latest fighter jet tender, at least in its present form, which lays out a specific requirement for the winner to pledge to arrange a certain amount of industrial cooperation with Canadian firms. “Fundamentally, the F-35 program is different from Foreign Military Sales or Direct Commercial Sales procurements,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the head of the F-35 JPO, wrote to the head of Canada’s Future Fighter Capability Project (FFCP) in December 2018. “The F-35 Partnership includes Canada as an integral member of a global enterprise containing multiple Partners, with both shared and unique strategic, operational, and tactical requirements and investment opportunities.” “This [partnership agreement] includes that Partners are prohibited from imposing requirements for work share or other industrial or commercial compensation,” Winter continued. “Instead, IP [industrial participation] is determined on a competitive, best value basis to maximize affordability across the F-35 enterprise.” You can read the full letter below: DOD via the Macdonald-Laurier Institute Ellen Lord, the U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, echoed the same sentiments in her own letter in August 2018. You can read that below, as well: DOD via the Macdonald-Laurier Institute In short, Lockheed Martin can’t meet the Canadian requirement for a certain level of industrial cooperation because the way the F-35 program is already structured, something that Canada is already benefiting from, that prohibits these kinds of firm allocations in favor of open competition. Giving Canada any leeway in this regard is a non-starter since it would open the door to other JSF partners demanding specific industrial offsets , rather than bidding among each other for them as they do now. “The current FFCP procurement process does not allow for the F-35 to participate in a fair and open competition that recognizes the special nature and distinct advantages of the Partnership,” Winter wrote. Lord described Canada’s current plan as “fundamentally and structurally prejudicial to any F-35 bid.” This can only put Canada in a particularly convoluted position. Authorities could certainly choose to disqualify any F-35 bid immediately for not meeting the industrial cooperation requirements, but this could potentially prompt a legal challenge from Lockheed Martin or an outcry from the U.S. government. In 2017, a trade dispute between Boeing and Canadian aircraft firm Bombardier, which eventually led to various economic threats from both U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, already killed a planned deal to purchase a number of new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets as an interim fighter jet. There have been reports since then that Boeing has faced its own specific challenges in entering the Super Hornet into the Canadian fighter jet competition. US Navy F/A-18E Super Hornets. , USN At the same time, loosening or removing the industrial participation requirements might leave Canadian authorities considering offers from the other three competitors without any firm guarantees in this regard. Those companies could certainly choose to include domestic cooperation as part of their proposals regardless, but would be up against an existing deal between Canada and the F-35 JPO. This, in turn, could lead to accusations that Lockheed Martin’s bid has an unfair advantage. It’s unclear where things stand now. In his December 2018 letter, Vice Admiral Winter asked Canadian authorities to let him know before the end of January 2019 about how they intended to proceed. Public reports as recently as April 2019 make no mention of any potential issues with the F-35’s participation in the competition. The country’s Department of National Defense says the goal is still to begin delivering new fighter jets of some kind to the Royal Canadian Air Force starting in 2022, though it has admitted the potential for delays in that aggressive schedule. Any difficulties in the contracting process would certainly push that date back. But after more than a decade of waiting for new fighter jets, the Royal Canadian Air Force has already gotten steadily stretched toward a breaking point and is now also suffering from a critical shortage of fighter pilots. The service can ill afford to wait much longer for Canada’s fighter jet replacement saga to finally reach its conclusion. It remains to be seen now whether Canada’s years of involvement in the F-35 program will actually prevent the Joint Strike Fighter from being one of the final contenders to replace the country’s increasingly dated CF-18s.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 12, 2019",USMC’s CH-53K King Stallion’s Woes Have Put It In A Duel With The CH-47 Chinook,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Congress has demanded that the Pentagon conduct a detailed assessment of the U.S. Marine Corps’ troubled CH-53K King Stallion program and examine potential alternatives, such as the CH-47 Chinook . Any decision to cut back CH-53K purchases, or abandon them altogether, would be a major blow to the manufacturer Sikorsky, now a part of Lockheed Martin, as well as a boon to Boeing, which makes the Chinook. Changes in the King Stallion program could also further delay Marines from getting a critically needed replacement for their aging CH-53E Super Stallions . Bloomberg was first to report the existence of the Congressionally mandated assessment of alternatives on May 6, 2019. Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who presently chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, requested the review on Apr. 4, 2019. It’s not clear when the review formally began. But at the time of Inhofe’s request, legislators were considering whether to approve a request from the Navy, which manages the CH-53K program on the Marine Corps’ behalf, to shift additional funds into that program to support continued work on fixing various technical problems that have emerged during the King Stallion’s flight testing. On Apr. 19, 2019, Congress approved the request to move an additional $79 million from other accounts into the CH-53K program, around half of what the Navy requested. It is unclear whether or not this was tied to the Pentagon acquiescing to Inhofe’s request for a review. The Pentagon’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) is leading the process, which will examine the “cost, schedule, and performance” of the CH-53K program, as well as provide “an assessment of alternatives for other platforms that might meet the mission,” CAPE director Robert Daigle told Bloomberg in an interview. Daigle is set to step down from his post this month and plans to return to the private sector. A CH-53K King Stallion., USMC “We have a limited amount of time to try and inform that decision as much as possible – so we have a very short window in which to do the best job we can on this analysis,” Daigle said to Bloomberg , though it was unclear if this was driven by his own limited time remaining on the job. At the time of the interview, the CAPE director hoped to have the assessment complete in “a handful of weeks.” Whatever CAPE’s findings are, they will have a major impact on the CH-53K, which has been in protracted development since 2006. By 2014, the date the Marines expected to reach initial operational capability with their new King Stallions had slipped from 2015 to 2019. An annual report that the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation released in February 2019 showed this had slipped again, but did not offer an updated timeline. “The Program Office is working a major schedule revision,” that report explained . There is a “need to correct multiple design deficiencies discovered during early testing. These include:  airspeed indication anomalies, low reliability of main rotor gearbox, hot gas impingement on aircraft structures, tail boom and tail rotor structural problems, overheating of main rotor dampers, fuel system anomalies, high temperatures in the #2 engine bay, and hot gas ingestion by the #2 engine, which could reduce available power.” Reports of these problems, which you can read about in more detail here, had first emerged publicly in January 2019. Continued gearbox trouble has proven to be especially vexing, being a major factor in earlier delays. In 2016 , the Navy insisted the issues had gotten resolved, only to see subsequent flight testing contradict that assessment. The Pentagon’s latest Selected Acquisition report to Congress, which Bloomberg had also obtained earlier in 2019, said the CH-53K still had a total of 126 technical deficiencies that needed correcting. The Marine Corps’ 2019 Aviation Plan now says the CH-53K IOC date is the beginning of the 2022 Fiscal Year, which starts on Oct. 1, 2021. A chart showing the US Marine Corp’s plan for the CH-53E and CH-53K, through Fiscal Year 2029, as of 2019., USMC All of this has driven up the estimated unit costs of the King Stallions, which stood at around a whopping $122 million, roughly the same as an F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, as of 2018. The Marines and Sikorsky have said that this could drop to an average of around $80 million if the Corps purchases its planned full fleet of 200 of the helicopters. The first production contract is under negotiation right now, despite the parallel Pentagon review. The Marines already have seven pre-production examples, having taken delivery of the first one in May 2018 . “I would expect that [deal] in the next coming weeks,” James Geurts, the Navy’s top acquisition officer, told the Senate Armed Services seapower subcommittee on Apr. 10, 2019 , making no mention of any CAPE assessment. “There are some things need to be fixed and I want them fixed in the production aircraft when they roll off.” A CH-53K gets airborne during a test., Lockheed Martin But there is some indication that the review might have factored into the hearing. Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, raised the possibility of the Marines buying an alternative helicopter instead, adding that he had spoken to Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller about the King Stallion and that the top Marine officer was less than pleased about the situation. “To be honest with you, I was disturbed by General Neller’s comments. He expressed pretty significant frustration to me about the status of this program,” Hawley said. “Do its [the CH-53K’s] capabilities justify its premium price over, say, the CH-47?” US Army CH-47 Chinooks., US Army CAPE’s Robert Daigle only mentioned the Chinook by name as being among the alternatives to the King Stallion that his office was considering. It is the only other American-made heavy lift helicopter currently in production. At least publicly, it is the position of the Marines, and not surprisingly Sikorsky, that only the CH-53K can meet the service’s requirements. These include the need for the helicopter to be able to carry a total payload of up to 36,000 pounds, including items carried slung below, and be able to carry 27,000 pounds out to an operational radius of 100 miles specifically for ship-to-shore missions during amphibious operations. The latest CH-47F model can carry around 21,000 pounds of cargo. There are also concerns about the extent of the modifications the Chinooks would need to operate in a maritime role on a protracted basis. While U.S. Army Chinooks, as well as special operations MH-47s from the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , do occasionally operate from ships, and examples around the world do so as well, it is typically for relatively short duration missions. An MH-47G Chinook from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment prepared to take off from the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge during a training exercise., USN These changes, among other things, would include features to help mitigate the impact of saltwater corrosion that shipboard aircraft encounter. In an example of how serious the issue would be, Army CH-47s conducting land-based relief efforts in the United States along the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in October 2018 needed regular washdowns to prevent dangerous salt buildup just from flying along the coastline. A fire engine at Tallahassee Regional Airport in Tallahassee, Florida rinses off an Ohio Army National Guard CH-47F Chinook during relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in October 2018., Ohio ARNG There’s also just the question about whether the facilities on board existing Navy amphibious ships would have the necessary space and features to support the CH-47 and its maintenance needs or if those vessels hangars and aircraft elevators would even be able to physically accommodate the Chinooks. Those same physical constraints could be a factor in what parts of an amphibious ship’s deck the helicopters can use for takeoffs, landings, and the loading and unloading of cargo, all of which could have an impact on sortie generation during actual operations. The CH-53K’s maximum height is close to 28 feet, but that’s predominantly due to the tail and tail rotor, which can fold down and to the side. This significantly reduces the overall height, as well as overall length, for parking the helicopters on an amphibious ship’s flight deck or hangar down below. Three Marine CH-53Es parked very close together in their folded configuration on the flight deck of a Navy amphibious ship. , USN The view inside the main hangar of the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, underscoring the physical constraints that Marine helicopters have to contend with., USN So, while the Chinook’s maximum height of 18 feet and length of 98 feet make it dimensionally smaller than the “unfolded” CH-53K, it has no way to readily make itself more compact for shipboard operations like the King Stallion. The CH-47’s dual rotors also present different safety requirements for how far away it needs to be during operation from other aircraft and potential hazards, which could be an issue for routine operations from an amphibious ship. By CAPE’s Daigle’s own assessment, the Chinook would not be able to offer a one-for-one replacement for the CH-53K just in terms of performance. “The analysis we’ve have done so far doesn’t suggest that the ’47 is actually going to meet the lift that the ’53K will provide so if you were going to go down the ’47 route, our current estimate says there will be an operational impact,” he told Bloomberg . This initial assessment was based, at least in part on information that Boeing submitted on a marinized CH-47 concept to CAPE and a meeting between the two parties at plane maker’s helicopter plant in Philadelphia on Apr. 25, 2019, according to Bloomberg . Still, Boeing would have to be eager to at least present as viable an alternative as possible. The Army, its largest single CH-47 customer, has proposed abandoning a purchase order of 28 additional F models in favor of reallocating those funds, approximately $962 million, elsewhere. This proposal has left the future of the Army’s CH-47F program in limbo, though there is growing Congressional pushback to the plan. Even just securing a portion of the orders that might otherwise go to Sikorsky for CH-53Ks could help ensure the stability of the Chinook line. US Air Force Pararescuemen look up at a US Army CH-47F., USAF Unfortunately, whatever option Congress, the Pentagon, the Navy, and Marines agree to in the end is still likely to involve some sort of additional delay. This is something the Corps can ill afford given its now long-standing need for a replacement for the aging CH-53E fleet, which has suffered a number of high-profile crashes in recent years. The Marine Corps says that the readiness rates of the CH-53E fleet have improved significantly in recent months, but has declined to disclose an actual mission capable rate. Instead, the service chose to highlight the Ready Basic Aircraft (RBA) rate, which is reportedly in the high 90-percent range. The Navy has officially described RBA as a “ lowered bar ” that simply refers to fixed and rotary wing aircraft that are flightworthy, but not even necessarily mission capable, let alone full mission capable, or “Code One,” meaning they can meet any assigned mission requirement. “As the Echo [CH-53E] guy, I’m not worried at all,” U.S. Marine Corps Captain Christopher Harrison, a spokesperson for the service told USNI News in March 2019, insisting that the CH-53K was still on schedule for its first operational deployment between 2023 and 2024. “We’re healthier now than we’ve been in the last 35 years as a community, which is pretty significant.” But while the Super Stallions may be in the best shape in recent memory, it would not necessarily take much for that community to note a dramatic improvement over how things have been since 2017, when mission capable rates slipped to less than 25 percent. Regardless, at a point, the helicopters will simply age out and the Marines won’t be able to wait forever for a replacement. The heavy lift support the CH-53Es provide right now is essential to the Corps’ operational doctrine and ensuring that there is no capability gap is critical. The service looks to be staring down delays, and the hard decisions that come with them, whichever helicopter it ends up flying in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 23, 2018","Canadian Auditors Slam Surplus Aussie Hornet Buy, Describe Fighter Force In Collapse","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Canada’s top parliamentary watchdog has released a scathing report regarding the purchase of second-hand F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets from Australia and broader plans to modernize the country’s air combat capabilities. The core complaints are that the new aircraft will still be obsolete after costly upgrades and that the service doesn’t have the manpower to fly and maintain the CF-18 Hornets it already has in service anyway. This, in turn, means that the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) will still almost certainly lack the necessary resources to adequately meet its North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) commitments simultaneously for years to come. The Office of the Auditor General of Canada, which reports directly to the country’s House of Commons and is analogous to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), released its report on Oct. 20, 2018. This comes less than three months after the U.S. government signed off on Australia’s sale of 25 F/A-18A/B aircraft to the Canadians. Of these, the RCAF will induct 18 aircraft into its fighter force and use the remaining seven as non-flying sources of spare parts. “We found that Canada’s [existing] fighter force could not meet the government’s new operational requirement, which is to have enough aircraft ready each day to meet the highest NORAD alert level and Canada’s NATO commitment at the same time,” the Auditor General report bluntly states in its introduction. “The fighter force could not meet the requirement because National Defense was already experiencing a shortage in personnel, and the CF-18 was old and increasingly hard to maintain.” The Canadian Department of National Defense has argued that this is why the additional fighters from Australia are critical to avoiding a capability gap within the RCAF, which has a fleet of around 75 CF-18A+ fighters. Canada hopes to retire all of these jets by 2032, replacing them with a total of 88 new aircraft . An RCAF CF-18A+ in Norway during Exercise Trident Juncture 2018 ., RCAF “I am pleased to announce that Canada has now signed the agreement to acquire 18 [F/A-18] aircraft to bridge the gap until we acquire our full fleet,” Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said on Oct. 20, 2018, in a televised response to the report. “This prudent measure will help mitigate the situation as we transition into our future fighters.” The Auditor General did not look into the broader replacement plans, which is a saga unto itself that you can read about in more detail here . Most importantly, in 2015, incoming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged to revisit Canada’s plan to purchase of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, in place for more than a decade, and reboot the fighter replacement competition. This sent the Canadians scurrying to find interim alternatives. A trade dispute with U.S. planemaker Boeing scuttled a proposed purchase of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and led to the present deal with Australia. But the parliamentary watchdog’s report vehemently disagreed with Sajjan’s arguments. “We concluded that National Defense has not done enough to manage risks related to Canada’s fighter aircraft fleet so that it can meet commitments to NORAD and NATO until a replacement fleet is in place.” One immediate problem is the age of the CF-18A+s and the incoming F/A-18A/Bs. Both Canada and Australia originally purchased these aircraft in the 1980s and they are among the oldest Hornets flying anywhere in the world. Canada has upgraded its jets over the years, but the last major update to the fleet occurred a decade ago. By 2032, when the RCAF hopes to have retired the last examples, any remaining jets will have been flying for more than two decades beyond their original planned out of service date. A Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18A., Australian DND The Australia fighters have received fewer improvements and the Canadians will have to spend some amount of money just to put them on par with their CF-18A+ configuration. All told, the Canadian Department of National Defense told the Auditor General that it expects to spend more than $2.2 billion in U.S. dollars on top of existing budgets to upgrade their second-hand jets and further extend the life of the existing fleet. This figure could easily grow. In his remarks on Nov. 20, 2018, Defense Minister Sajjan said he had ordered his department to prepare “options” for “improving the combat capability” of the country’s fighter jets, but did not say when he expected to get that information or make a decision. Roughly a quarter of that amount is already set aside for the purchase of the F/A-18A/Bs and to upgrade them to a standard similar to the CF-18A+. That leaves around $1.5 billion for additional upgrades and service life extensions , a complete package that could cost tens of millions per aircraft depending on the extent of the work. Canada’s Department of National Defense has estimated it will need close to a billion dollars just “for spare parts and upgrades to the structure and avionics and electrical systems, but not any combat capability upgrades,” according to the Auditor General. If these estimates are accurate, this would leave limited funds left over for even relatively simple combat upgrades, such as giving even a significant portion of the Hornets new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. These would help boost the jets spot and engage enemies at extended ranges. There are cost-effective options, such as Raytheon’s Advanced Combat Radar (RACR) or Northrop Grumman’s Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), but the total amount to upgrade more than 90 jets could quickly add up, So, the question quickly becomes whether Canada will have the resources to truly keep its Hornets combat relevant, especially in a high-end conflict against a major opponent, such as Russia, through to 2032. In addition to its NORAD commitments, the RCAF is a regular contributor to NATO air policing missions , which monitor for airspace violations and other potential threats along the alliance’s eastern flank with Russia. It is important for the aircraft to present a credible deterrent. Sajjan and his office are already under fire for how they have described the capability gap . There are now growing criticisms about whether the purchase of the Australian Hornets has prevented the RCAF from upgrading the aircraft it has already or working to mitigate other tangential issues. Access to Information requests have not turned up any official Department of National Defense documentation defining the “capability gap” that Sajjan first identified in November 2016, according to a report from the Ottawa Citizen on Nov. 19, 2018. Conservative Party lawmakers have long accused Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party Government, of which Sajjan is a member, of artificially creating the problem as a way of defending the effective cancellation of the F-35 purchases. Being able to simultaneously provide aircraft for NORAD and NATO missions “demands a certain number of aircraft that our present CF-18 fleet is unable to meet on its day-to-day serviceability rate,” now-retired Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General Mike Hood, who was head of the service at the time, told the Canadian Senate later in 2016. “They’ve [the Liberals] changed the policy of the number of aircraft I have to have.” Now-retired Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General Mike Hood., RCAF Trudeau’s administration has, in turn, accused Conservatives of leaving the country with dated aircraft that are increasingly difficult to maintain by refusing to proceed with any major upgrades or interim improvements to the Hornet fleet even as the F-35 program suffered setbacks and delays . Sajjan reiterated those complaints in public response to the Auditor General’s review. Still, the exact number and capabilities of the actual fighters the RCAF needs may not be the most important issue at the end of the day. “We also found that the government’s proposed solution of buying interim aircraft will not help solve either the personnel shortage or the aging fleet,” the Auditor General review notes. The report says that the RCAF has less than 70 percent of the pilots it needs to fulfill its NORAD and NATO commitments right now. Of that force, around 28 percent have not even met their annual flying hour requirements due to the lack of available airframes. On average, the CF-18A+s require 24 hours of maintenance for every one hour they fly, up from 21 hours in 2014. On top of that, a significant loss of maintainers has exacerbated that issue, contributing to the cascading issues that have limited the service’s ability to generate sorties for any mission. RCAF maintainers replace an engine on a CF-18A+., RCAF “If CF-18 pilots continue to leave at the current rate, there will not be enough experienced pilots to train the next generation of fighter pilots,” according to the Auditor General. “National Defense will not have enough pilots to be able to meet the government’s requirement to meet the highest NORAD alert level and the commitment to NATO at the same time.” In 2017, the Canadians did approve a plan, with a price tag of more than $470 million, to hire contractors and train more maintainers. “At the time of our audit, the plan was in the early stages of implementation, and it was too soon to assess whether it would work,” the review says. There is no similar plan for increasing the number of pilots or using private companies to help train them. This all brings into question whether the RCAF will be able to absorb the new aircraft at all, let alone make good use of them to bolster its capabilities. “The Department [of National Defense] stated that it needed more qualified technicians and pilots, not more fighter aircraft,” the audit notes itself, raising doubts about the core goals of the F/A-18 purchases. Canada’s Department of National Defense says it is working on an all-new recruitment and retention policy, but that it won’t be ready for implementation until sometime in 2019. There’s no assurance it will work quickly, if at all, to address the pilot and maintainer shortfalls in the near term. Without adequate personnel, Canada may find itself with a fighter jet gap regardless of how many planes it actually has and of what type.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To call the events of the last 48 hours peculiar would be an understatement. After the White House released a statement, from National Security Advisor John Bolton of all people, about repositioning a carrier strike group and redeploying strategic bombers to the Middle East in response to some nebulous threat from Iran, additional statements from other officials trying to clarify the original one have offered no additional clarity. In addition, rumors regarding what the supposed threat was from Iran have proliferated without any confirmation of what is actually real. Then, just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was already in Europe on a diplomatic mission, was supposed to head to Germany, that trip was abruptly canceled without formal explanation and Pompeo’s C-32A aircraft immediately headed south, ending up in Baghdad, Iraq. Why all the secrecy and unexplained actions? If Iran was planning something or doing something provocative, why not just put them on notice and give the American people the basic details surrounding the issue? The answer to those questions could end up being far more troubling than the reasons for asking them. We discussed the peculiar nature of the original announcement and the issues surrounding the person who made it on Sunday in a piece you should read here . Since writing that article, the shadows of possible facts have grown longer, but none of them have actually come into the light. There have been claims by a limited number of outlets that Israel provided intelligence—very possibly nebulous in nature—to the U.S. of the possibility of an attack by Iranian forces on U.S. interests in the Middle East. There’s far too little even in terms of conjecture in these reports to score such a possibility as the motive for the U.S. military’s movements and the high-profile nature of the orders that spurred them. Also, it cannot be denied that Israel has its own very serious set of issues with Iran and their motives for conveying such information have to be examined. As the media questioned the actual reasoning behind Bolton’s fiery deployment announcement, still acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan waded shallowly into the ongoing story by giving up very little in terms of specifics. He stated in a Tweet: “Last night’s announced deployment of the @CVN_72 and a @USAirForce bomber task force to the @CENTCOM area of responsibility, which I approved yesterday, represents a prudent repositioning of assets in response to indications of a credible threat by Iranian regime forces. We call on the Iranian regime to cease all provocation. We will hold the Iranian regime accountable for any attack on US forces or our interests.” Once again, we have zero specifics on what Iran is doing to provoke the United States or what their plans are to attack such a superiorly armed foe. As for the U.S. bomber deployment originally mentioned in Bolton’s statement, we now know the force will be made up of four B-52H Stratofortresses. What was one of the more bizarre pieces of this half-finished puzzle was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s sudden mission to Baghdad, Iraq. Pompeo’s next stop on his trip to Europe was Berlin to meet with high-ranking German officials. This was abruptly canceled with only a cryptic statement that Pompeo had to divert to another location “due to pressing issues.” Plane trackers followed his C-32A as it seemed to be heading toward Baghdad, where he materialized hours later. A press pool blackout went along with the change in plans. Pompeo said that the motive behind his trip was due to the same intelligence that the administration has been vaguely referencing since Sunday, and that the reasoning for going to Baghdad was as follows : “To speak with the leadership there, to assure them that we stood ready to continue to ensure that Iraq is a sovereign, independent nation… Certainly, it’s the case that if American interests in Iraq are threatened, it would impact Iraq as well… This would be an effort to take American forces out that continue our campaign against ISIS. It’s incredibly important to the Iraqi government. That campaign to continue to prevent ISIS terror inside of Iraq itself is something that’s very central, central to the Iraqi government… The central messages are this: We want to make sure that Iraq is positioned so that the relationship that we’ve built with them and that our allies in the region have built with them—allies that range all across the Gulf, who understand that the primary threat in the Middle East is Iran—remains strong, that those relationships remain strong.” This is an interesting set of statements from a guy who just a couple of days earlier said the redeployment of the carrier strike group was in the works for some time . Iran threatening U.S. forces in Iraq seems like a very strange act as Iran enjoys a very good relationship with much of the Iraqi government. Also, the U.S. has repeatedly made similar assertions in years past , but they have never materialized. Simply put, Iran launching unapproved attacks on U.S. installations in the country, with American troops deployed there at the request of the Iraqi government, and fighting an enemy common among the U.S., Iraq, and Iran, seems very unlikely. Unless, of course, Pompeo was there to reassure that the relationship between the U.S. and Iraq wasn’t about to crumble in favor of a better one between Iraq and Iran. Certainly, this has been a haunting possibility for some time, especially as economic ties between the two neighbors grow deeper. The U.S. depends more on its bases in Iraq now than it did a handful of months ago, before President Trump ordered the drawdown of U.S. forces in Syria. Trump visited a base in Western Iraq over Christmas that would become far more imperative in handling the situation in Syria after U.S. forces largely vacate the country. Trump also said he wanted U.S. forces there to keep an eye on Iranian activities . Those words angered top officials within the Iraqi government who see Iran as a key ally, not a foe. But it’s glaringly clear that Iran has long pined for a ‘land bridge’ between its own borders and Lebanon, where its Hezbollah proxies’ power continues to grow. Ejecting the U.S. from both Iraq and Syria would go a long way to making this possible. So whatever Iran is supposedly planning, if they are indeed planning anything at all, maybe it has a larger political influence component than a military one. On the other hand, if the U.S. was planning on some sort of military action against Iran, trying to see that Iraq wouldn’t immediately side with Tehran and kick every American out of the country would also be an important diplomatic objective, indeed. Now there are growing rumors that Iran has been spotted moving ballistic missiles by ship to various launch positions around the Persian Gulf and especially near the volatile chokepoint that is the Strait of Hormuz . Even firing the missiles on the boats themselves has been mentioned by “undisclosed sources,” albeit without any credible evidence that this is planned or even possible. Beyond having a capable , robust, and in many cases highly protected land attack ballistic missile force, Iran has been developing short-range anti-ship ballistic missiles for some time and says it has a real operational capability in this regard. Ballistic missiles that are able to target moving vessels at sea are in many ways harder to defend against than anti-ship cruise missiles, especially due to their high-altitude mid-course stage of flight and high-speed during their terminal phase of flight. Fateh Mobin short-range ballistic missile is said to be anti-ship capable and indigenously produced. The missile seems ideally suited for engaging ships within the confines of the Persian Gulf., Iranian State Media These missiles pose a serious threat to American warships in the confined space of the Persian Gulf, especially when combined with a layered attack that also includes air-breathing anti-ship cruise missiles launched from shore, ships, aircraft, and submarines, as well as swarming small boat attacks , remote-controlled drone boats , and more. The stark truth is that Iran has been training to take out a U.S. aircraft carrier for decades. But actually using these weapons in an attempt to do so is straight-up an act of war—one that Iran is sure to lose against the might of American forces, not to mention their ever more powerful allies that line the western banks of the Persian Gulf. Iranians are all about signaling and threats—nothing new there at all. But they aren’t suicidal. One of the biggest issues here with these reports is that if they are true, it is a chicken or the egg situation. In other words, is Iran preparing to defend itself from an incoming carrier strike group that has the mandate of threats made by the highest ranking members of the Trump Administration, or was it moving the missiles around before any of this happened? Undisclosed sources from various reports say no it was happening before, but we don’t know that answer for sure, and it is a crucial one to get right. Even if Iran was moving around ballistic missiles prelude to Bolton’s announcement, how is this really a sign of impending attack? Iran constantly runs elaborate military drills that include deploying various weapon systems to new locations, and often right in the middle of the volatile Strait of Hormuz. They have also been shuttling around ballistic missiles, including to their proxies in Yemen , for years now. More so, tensions are rising with the U.S. over Trump pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-leveraging old sanctions on Tehran that are crushing its economy. Just as recently as today, there have been mixed indications that Iran may pull out of the Iran nuclear deal as the benefits of sticking to it are now questionable at best and place its own ‘reciprocal measures’ on the United States. The outright fiery disdain for the Iranian regime among key officials the Trump Administration is also no secret. So, seeing Iran fortify its defenses and deterrent capabilities in what has always been a major world hotspot and strategic economic corridor isn’t really all that surprising. Part of the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group underway., USN So that’s where it stands at this moment. Two days after Bolton’s statement we have more questions and even fewer answers. Within a matter of says, the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group will likely plow its way through the Strait of Hormuz, which will probably the tensest and most heavily surveilled such transit in a long time. But it’s also worth noting that the Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group is already in the Persian Gulf, so it’s not like the Iranians don’t have a capital ship to harass already if they wanted to. And by all accounts, including the Navy’s own metrics, they have not wanted to at all. The number of times Iran harassed American vessels in 2018 and so far in 2019 stands at zero . All this has left many wondering if Bolton and Co. may be goading Iran into firing first in order to provide a pretext to give the Iranian regime a ‘bloody nose.’ Bolton has wanted to bomb Iran for various reasons in the past, so this is hardly an absurd proposition. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail as the last thing the U.S. or the world needs right now is the Persian Gulf turning into a shooting gallery.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 3, 2020",USAF F-35As Will Get Navy’s New Air Defense Busting Missile Amid Talk Of Anti-Ship Variants,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman are making good progress on the development of a new high-speed missile to suppress and destroy enemy radars and other air defense emitters, and the Air Force has now also joined the program. In addition, recent changes to the weapon’s design include a new, compact warhead seated inside a modular payload space, a concept that could open up new roles for the missile in the future, including maritime strike. The Air Force itself is already looking to turn the weapon into a precision strike tool for knocking out various time-sensitive targets on land. U.S. Navy Captain Matthew Commerford, the Program Manager for Direct and Time Sensitive Strike weapons at Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), and Gordon Turner, the Vice President for Programs and Business Development at Northrop Grumman’s Innovation Systems Division gave reporters the update at the Navy League’s annual Sea, Air, Space convention on May 6, 2019. The Navy began development of the missile, known as the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) and now designated the AGM-88G, in 2018. The program entered its engineering and manufacturing development phase in March 2019. The AGM-88G is a major rework of the AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM), which Northrop Grumman also produces and that you can read about in more detail here . The AARGM-ER uses the same guidance and control systems as the AARGM and retains the primary mission of homing in on and destroying hostile radars and other emitters. A mockup of the AARGM-ER., Joseph Trevithick But the AGM-88G puts those electronics into an entirely new airframe optimized for high speed that is wider and dispenses with the fins in the mid-section in favor of stabilizing strakes that extend along the length of the body. The missile’s control surfaces are all at the rear and the weapon has a new, significantly more powerful rocket motor to give the added boosts in speed and range. USN A more recent development is the addition of a new, smaller warhead that uses Northrop Grumman’s Lethality Enhanced Ordnance (LEO) technology, which you can read more about in detail here . LEO warheads combine a PBXN-110 explosive filler and specially designed fragmentation layer that the company says it can scale and configure to be optimally suited to taking out a wide variety of soft targets. This offers the “same lethality, [but] less volume,” according to Captain Commerford. “That’s going to give us more volume in the airframe to do future upgrades.” USN The missile’s payload bay is modular, to begin with. The Navy and Northrop Grumman pointed out that this will already help support the missile’s flight test program, which is set to begin in 2021, since engineers will be able to quickly swap in specialized testing equipment in lieu of a live warhead for initial captive carries and launches. Neither the Navy nor Northrop Grumman has given any details about the exact performance specifications for the AAGM-ER, but the older AARGM can reportedly hit targets more than 80 miles away and hit a top speed of around Mach 2 in a final sprint. While we don’t know the specifics, the new missile needs additional thermal protection and insulation for the radome to shield the control and guidance systems against the added strain from how much faster it will be flying. The added speed and range over the AARGM “makes the missions and the targets more achievable,” Captain Commerford explained. The Navy is looking to reach initial operational capability with the AARGM-ER on both the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler in 2023, which will give these aircraft important additional stand-off capabilities against steadily improving enemy air defenses. A US Navy EA-18G Growler carrying an AGM-88E AARGM., USN The Air Force is now formally part of the AARGM-ER program, as well. “We signed that agreement late in 2018,” Commerford said. The Air Force will lead work to integrate the AGM-88G into the internal bays on the F-35A and C Joint Strike Fighters and plans to have the weapon ready for service on its F-35As starting in 2025. The missile is too large to fit inside the truncated internal weapons bays of the Marine Corps F-35Bs. But all of these features, combined with the modular payload bay, open up the possibility the AARGM-ER will be much more than just a weapon for suppressing and destroying enemy air defenses. The existing AARGM already has multi-mode guidance capability that includes a GPS-assisted inertial navigation system and a millimeter wave radar seeker. This gives it the ability to hunt down targets that may have stopped emitting radio signals to home in on, if they were ever doing so at all, as well as just strike a particular set of map coordinates. This more general strike capability already works against targets on land and at sea, including those in motion or that might try to flee after the missile’s launch. With all this in mind, the Air Force is already investigating turning the AARGM-ER into a precision strike weapon, called the Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW), which you can read about more here . Suffice to say, leveraging the AGM-88G’s performance will ensure SiAW can fill a growing demand for a weapon that has sufficient range and speed to quickly engage and destroy a variety of land-based threats, including pop-up targets, right as they emerge. It’s unclear when the Air Force plans to field this follow-on missile. As the lead for AARGM-ER, the Navy is supporting the SiAW program, but Captain Commerford could only say that the Air Force had recently completed an analysis of alternatives on the general missile design and that “they’re still resolving what their long-term plan is.” But time-sensitive strike is only one of the potential roles that AARGM-ER, or a derivative thereof, might fill in the future. “Some nations don’t have the resources to pursue specific weapons” for maritime strike, Northrop Grumman’s Turner said. The existing AARGM is already an international partnership both between the U.S. and Italian governments and Northrop Grumman and European missile conglomerate MBDA. There has been significant international interest in the AGM-88E and this could easily feed into international sales for the AGM-88G in any number of configurations. Turner added that unspecified potential international customers had already approached the company specifically about a potential variant optimized. The bigger question for a maritime strike variant might be what sized ships that customers see as the primary threats and whether the modular payload bay is sufficiently large to accommodate a warhead capable of doing major damage to those targets. While we don’t know the size of the AGM-88G’s warhead, the one in the AGM-88E is around 150 pounds. The warhead in a Harpoon anti-ship missile is in the 500-pound class, while the one in the Naval Strike Missile , which the Navy is now buying, is closer to the 250-pound class. Regardless, even a small anti-ship missile with a time-sensitive strike capability could be valuable for rapidly engaging smaller ships . It could also be valuable as a means of striking specific systems, such as radars or other emitters, to disable key capabilities on larger ships and achieve a “mission kill.” If the AARGM-ER’s multi-mission capabilities really take off, it might migrate to other platforms, as well, beyond even just aircraft. In 2018, Northrop Grumman revealed a surface-launched concept for both the AGM-88E and AGM-88G, which The War Zone was first to report on . A model of a containerized launch system for the AARGM or AARGM-ER. The missile depicted here is an AARGM-ER., Joseph Trevithick “It’s an industry initiative,” Northrop Grumman’s turner explained. The goal is to “show how we can take that developed weapon capability in AARGM or AARGM-ER and deploy that off of other launch platforms.” Precision land-attack and maritime strike variants could certainly add additional flexibility to this containerized system. The weapon might also be adaptable to existing ground-based launchers or vertical launch systems on ships. All told, the AARGM-ER’s future looks very bright as an extremely capable means of suppressing and destroying enemy air defenses in the near term and much, much more down the road.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 8, 2019",Behold Italy’s FREMM Frigate In U.S. Navy FFG(X) Future Frigate Configuration,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Italy’s Fincantieri Marine Group’s entrant into the FFG(X) is one of the most promising in the field of five contenders as it is based on the successful and modern Fregata Europea Multi-Missione (FREMM) —or European Multi-Mission Frigate in English—that will serve a number of multi-national users, already including NATO allies France and Italy. While we know what the existing ships look like in their various configurations, which includes anti-submarine, general purpose, and air defense variants with various other customizations based on the user’s demands, we haven’t really seen what a U.S. version would look like in tangible form, that is until now. Fincantieri is the largest shipbuilder in Europe and brings a strong pedigree to the table and a design that is known to be flexible and effective. If they were to win the FFG(X) tender, the ships would be built by Marinette Marine in Wisconsin —a wholly owned subsidiary of Fincantieri and the same shipbuilder that currently produces Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ships. While the FREMM design is considered off the shelf, it will need to be equipped with loads of U.S.-specific hardware. These demands, which you can read all about here and here , will drastically change the look of the ship, and especially its superstructure as it will have to house three Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) arrays, each containing nine AESA modules. Italy’s General Purpose configuration of the FREMM-based Bergamini class., Fabius1975/wikicommons Aquitaine class anti-submarine focused variant of FREMM. , French Navy A model of the FREMM FFG(X) variant was displayed at this year’s Air-Sea-Space symposium right outside of Washington, D.C. As you can see, beyond sporting the EASR arrays, the ship has a similar raked mast as what’s found on the Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Also visible is a 32 cell vertical launch system (VLS) magazine ahead of the superstructure, a 57mm deck gun, eight canister-launched Naval Strike Missile s, and a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher above the hangar deck. #Fincantieri unveiled their #FFGX proposal for the US Navy today at #SAS Sea Air Space outside Washington.

The FREMM’s Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion concept would also bring a new level of efficiency to the Navy’s surface combatant fleet. Also at Air-Sea-Space was some updated renderings of General Dynamics and Bath Iron Works’ FFG(X) variant of the Spanish F100 Álvaro de Bazán class , which looks a lot like mini Arleigh Burke class destroyer: #GD #BIW General Dynamics #Bath Iron Works also unveiled their #FFGX proposal for the US #Navy today at #SAS ,  based on partner #Navantia 's F100 design. Good looking ship! pic.twitter.com/kW6DPBXPqr — Chris Cavas (@CavasShips) May 6, 2019 The F100 has always been a leading contender for FFG(X), but some have noted that the loss of the Norwegian guided missile frigate Helge Ingstad , which is based on the F100 design, last November, may have adversely impacted its chances. This comes from a preliminary Norwegian investigation into that accident that suggested design flaws may have exacerbated the damage, a claim that Spain’s Navantia—the shipbuilder—disputes. Austal USA’s model of their supersized Independence class Littoral Combat Ship-turned FFG(X) was also on display. It is pretty interesting as it shows the VLS mounted behind the flight deck along with a large open space that one could imagine would be used for future expansion, such as the addition of laser systems—the FFG(X) will have power on hand for at least a 150-kilowatt laser system —or modular weapons and sensor weapons payloads: Austal’s FFG(X) entrant. , Joseph Trevithick Lockheed didn’t have a model displayed of their Freedom class LCS derivative being proposed for FFG(X), but it should look similar to when we saw it last year, although they may have lengthened it to add space for more VLS cells and a tweaked propulsion system . Lockheed evolved LCS design for FFG(X) seen in 2018. , Joseph Trevithick As for Huntington Ingalls FFG(X) design, we still have yet to see a mature configuration in model or rendering form. When asked about their FFG(X) entrant at this year’s Sea-Air-Space symposium by our own Joseph Trevithick, “we are participating” is all a representative from Huntington Ingalls Industries would say. “No comment,” they added when asked to confirm that the proposed design would still be derived from the Legend class National Security Cutter. As it sits now, the Navy has gone from targeting a unit price of nearly $1B per FFG(X) hull to $800M, so cost should be a major factor in who wins the contract for 20 ships. Finalized proposals from all five competitors will be submitted by late summer/early fall and a winner will be announced in 2020. The first ships will be bought in 2020 and 2021—one each year—with the first coming online around 2025. The remaining 18 ships would be bought at a rate of two per year through 2030, but it is very possible that construction could be extended and even ramped-up if the Navy likes what it receives and money is available to do so. FFG(X) is truly the most exciting program the Navy has running right now because it stands to realign what missions are assigned to what ships in a very positive way. In addition, FFG(X) will be able to leverage many technologies that have been proven on larger U.S. surface combatants and miniaturized over time or directly migrated to the smaller and more efficient hullforms. In other words, the age of the frigate has arrived as these ships will be able to do many missions that the Navy’s destroyers, and cruisers to a lesser degree, are currently tasked with, freeing up those multi-billion dollar ships for higher-end missions that are in extreme demand. USN Growth in capability is also part of the FFG(X) initiative. These ships will likely end up hosting more advanced capabilities than they have initially, giving them even more high-end combat punch. But above all else, FFG(X) will help mitigate the ramifications of the dismal Littoral Combat Ship debacle that has plagued the Navy for over a decade and a half and will put the seagoing force back on course when it comes to fielding a reliable and affordable, yet still potent surface combat capability for decades to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 12, 2018",New Lockheed Concept Shows Navy F-35C Armed With Hypersonic Cruise Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has revealed a concept for a variant of its air-launched Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept hypersonic missile, or HAWC, as an armament option for U.S. Navy’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighter , and potentially other aircraft, possibly in a maritime strike role. HAWC, which has so far been under development as a land attack weapon, is set to fly for the first time before the end of the year. The artist’s conception of an F-35C firing a HAWC derivative first appeared at the Navy League’s annual Sea, Air, Space convention just outside of Washington, D.C., on May 6, 2019. The rendering shows the stealth aircraft configured to carry two of these weapons externally, one under each wing. In April 2018 , the U.S. Air Force, working together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth approximately $928 million for the development of HAWC. As its name suggests, HAWC is an air-breathing weapon that flies at hypersonic speed, which is typically defined as anything above Mach 5. The Air Force and DARPA have said that missile will use a rocket booster to accelerate to at least that speed, after which a high-speed scramjet engine will kick in and ensure it maintains a speed between Mach 5 and 10. An artist’s conception of a HAWC follow-on variant for the US Navy., Joseph Trevithick HAWC, as well as other hypersonic weapons, open up the ability to conduct game-changing short- or no-notice strikes against time-sensitive and other critical targets, and do so at long ranges, something The War Zone has examined in depth in the past. Hypersonics can also maneuver within the atmosphere, following a more unpredictable flight path compared to other traditional long-range weapons, such as ballistic missiles, making it harder for an opponent to defend against them. These same benefits apply regardless of whether the target is on land or at sea. An artist’s rendition of a US Navy F-35C Joint Strike Fighter carrying a future HAWC variant under its wing while firing another. , Joseph Trevithick DARPA and the Air Force have already billed HAWC as something of a stepping stone to more refined air-launched, air-breathing hypersonic weapon developments in the future. The program “will develop and demonstrate technologies for an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile,” according to the description in DARPA’s most recent budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year. “These technologies include advanced air vehicle configurations capable of efficient hypersonic flight, hydrocarbon scramjet-powered propulsion to enable sustained hypersonic cruise, thermal management approaches designed for high-temperature cruise, and affordable system designs and manufacturing approaches.” Details on the HAWC program from DARPA’s latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year., DOD So, with all this in mind, it’s not surprising that the U.S. Navy would be interested in HAWC and in the potential for an anti-ship version in the future. The weapon’s speed and inherent maneuverability would certainly help in the development of a variant for rapidly prosecuting strikes against moving maritime targets. Lockheed Martin’s artwork depicts an F-35C carrying the weapon externally, which would effectively eliminate its stealth qualities. However, the speed and range of hypersonic weapons give them an intrinsic stand-off capability, making this a less pressing issue. At the same time, those same characteristics make hypersonic weapons ideally suited to non-stealthy launch platforms, as well. HAWC, or a maritime strike variant thereof, could just as easily be an option for other Navy fighter jets, such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet , underscoring the reality that fighters will increasingly be carrying outsized stand-off weapons as time goes on. Larger platforms, such as the Navy’s P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, might find themselves carrying HAWC follow-on variants, too. An anti-ship variant could also find a home in the Air Force on that service’s B-1 or B-52 bombers , the former of which are already able to carry Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), giving them a significant new maritime strike role. It might be an option for smaller Air Force But, at the moment, any actual follow-on variants of HAWC still seem to be a ways off. At present, HAWC is in a “ race ” with another U.S. military hypersonic weapon program, Tactical Boost Glide (TBG), to see which will fly first. DARPA is developing TBG, which is an unpowered boost-glide vehicle , together with the Air Force and the U.S. Navy for air- and ship-launched applications, respectively. A 2017 US Air Force briefing slide offering information on both TBG and HAWC, collectively known together as the High Speed Strike Weapon (HSSW) effort., USAF “We’re on track for both to have flights … before the calendar year ends,” Dr. Steven Walker, head of DARPA, told reporters on May 1, 2019 . Even so, when “you actually get into the building of these things and qualifying the hardware, … things tend to slip,” he cautioned. DARPA’s latest budget request says the current plan is for the first flight of HAWC to occur sometime in Fiscal Year 2020, which begins on Oct. 1, 2019. There are multiple flight tests scheduled for that fiscal cycle, which runs through Sept. 30, 2020. If Lockheed Martin’s art is anything to go by, interest is already growing outside of the Air Force in both HAWC and whatever variants or follow-on hypersonic missiles might come next.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2019",Carrier And Bombers Ordered To Middle East Without Any Details On Supposed Iranian Threat,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Conflicting messaging is coming out of the Trump Administration as to why the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a contingent of strategic bombers are being deployed to the Persian Gulf area of operations. The initial news of the deployments came in a peculiar form, emanating from controversial National Security Advisor John Bolton, not the Pentagon, the President, or a White House spokesperson. The official statement from Bolton reads: “In response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings, the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force. The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.” At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the deployment was “something we’ve been working on for a little while,” indicating that it wasn’t really a result of new intelligence or a set of evolving circumstances, while also adding that there have been “escalatory actions from the Iranians,” but giving no examples of such acts. This begs the question, is this just a planned deployment that is being repackaged to put Iran further on notice? Bolton’s statement doesn’t even mention the current spate of rocket attacks in Israel, nor does it make those actions part of the case for the seemingly abrupt movement of American forces. Hamas, which enjoys support from Iran, has fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days and Israel has launched a large number of retaliatory strikes on Hamas locations in the Gaza Strip, including killing Hamas’ liaison with Iran , the first targeting killing by Israeli forces in years. מבט מהאוויר. סיכול אחמד חודרי ע""י צה""ל והשב""כ pic.twitter.com/sfzAt6MlkL — דובר צה״ל דניאל הגרי – Daniel Hagari (@IDFSpokesperson) May 5, 2019 Up until recently, USS Abraham Lincoln and her escorts were churning through the waters in Eastern Mediterranean, putting them in a prime position for pushing south, through the Suez Canal and eventually into the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. The two maritime hotspots in that region would be the Mandeb Strait and the Strait Of Hormuz , both of which are major chokepoints that Iran and its proxies could attempt to shut off at any given time. Such a move could have a dire economic impact across global markets and more. The Mandeb Strait has already become a low-intensity missile shooting gallery in recent years, while the U.S. is fully aware of Iran’s ability to cut off the Strait of Hormuz, which could severely impact even the U.S. military’s own logistics. It’s also worth noting that the Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group’s (ARG) last known position was the Persian Gulf and the first Middle East detachment of the USAF F-35As is also in the region at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE. Flight operations aboard USS Abraham Lincoln in the Mediterranian. , USN The order to move bombers back into the Middle East is a bit more intriguing as America’s B-52 and B-1B fleets have just gotten their first reprieve from constant forward deployments to the Middle East, and the combat operations that came with those deployments, in years. With B-1Bs leaving Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar last March, it was thought that an extensive break from the rotational bomber deployments there would allow the bombers to receive much-needed maintenance and upgrades and allow for their crew to take part training for other mission sets. The tired B-1B force was grounded for weeks not long after its last aircraft returned from the Middle East due to issues with the type’s troubled ejection system. The swing-wing bombers began returning to the air just last week. It’s important to note that we don’t know what bomber type is being sent back to the Arabian Peninsula to fulfill the recently announced orders. It is possible that this movement, and the high-end messaging that has come with it, was planned to follow the Trump Administration’s somewhat sudden announcement that it would not grant eight countries continuing waivers to import crude oil from Iran. The White House provided the waivers following its reinstatement of sanctions on Iran after tearing up the Iran nuclear deal that was executed by the Obama Administration. Clearly, cutting off Iran from the remaining eight oil importing countries as approved by the U.S. would put an even tighter squeeze on Iran’s faltering economy and could heighten the risk of Iran lashing out as a result. With this in mind, this all could have been planned in anticipation of Iranian threats. All this is part of maximum pressure policy against Iran that is largely seen as the brainchild of National Security Advisor John Bolton, a longtime hawk when it comes to Iran ( and much more ), its missile and nuclear programs , and the country’s military excursions abroad , who has continuously pushed for regime change over the years. Although Iran stands no chance of winning a protracted military conflict with the United States and its allies in the region, such an action could come at an incredibly high price. Iran has the ability to rain ballistic missiles down throughout the region, including on installations where American units are based. The Persian Gulf would likely instantly turn into a super-anti-ship missile engagement zone, which would result in major losses, both intended and unintended, and could possibly cause an environmental disaster. Mining of the Strait of Hormuz would result in a long de-mining effort that may not even be possible to begin until hostilities cease. This would cut the world off from a massive amount of its daily oil supply and would likely crush the world economy and have a terrible impact on the world’s population, and especially on those living in poorer countries. National Security Advisor John Bolton., AP Iran could also activate its proxies for a full-on assault on U.S. interests and that of its allies. Hezbollah, which has tens of thousands of powerful rockets in Lebanon, and other advanced weapons, would surely open a second front on Israel’s northern border. That conflict has alone has become particularly dreaded as Hezbollah’s weapons capabilities and fighting experience in Syria have mounted. Keep in mind that this doesn’t even start to go into the idea of regime change, which would include stabilizing the Iranian population after the initial fighting and making sure what comes next in terms of leadership in that country isn’t worse than what came before. The American people have no appetite for more wars of choice in the Middle East and especially long-term occupations. But if things dramatically escalate, even from a very limited conflict, to begin with, there may be few alternatives. The bottom line here is that a war with Iran would make the invasion of Iraq look like a relatively tame, highly localized conflict and full-on regime change operation would likely be a generational project of incredible cost, both in terms of blood and treasure. John Bolton’s particular brand of hawkish foreign policy was key in getting us into the Iraq War catastrophe and what came after and he seems to want something similar in Iran. The warning alarms have been ringing on this for some time now from a wide variety of sources . They should be heeded. Clearly, if there is real intel that points to potential Iranian actions that would heavily impact American interests in the region, pouring in military assets to deter such acts makes sense. But if the Administration is looking to give Iran a “bloody nose” in order to put them in their place, which Bolton, in particular, has wanted in the past , doing so doesn’t come without risk of starting something much more consequential that can’t be stopped.

I was running a fever through most of it and pitching stuff to Joe to knock out of the park. He did an awesome job keeping the gears turning, kudos to him. We definitely had some weird news. The defecting Beluga whale was my favorite, but quite honestly we had been keeping a very close eye on Venezuela as some sort of military action by the U.S. seems increasingly possible. We also got word that the USAF’s F-35As have waded into combat for the first time. Yet the biggest rush of news came on Friday, started with exciting info that the Air Force’s laser intended to one day equip its fighter aircraft is making real progress. And just as we predicted, Russia is circling Turkey with offers to sell their Su-57 fighter jets in place of embargoed F-35As. Then just before the day ended, news broke that North Korea had launched a number of short-range missiles, the first time in a year and a half, and an ominous sign of what may be to come. There was still a ton of stuff we just couldn’t get to, but it’s not too late! Welcome to Bunker Talk. This is a weekend open discussion post for the best commenting crew on the net, in which we can chat about all the stuff that went on this week that we didn’t get to.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 9, 2019",North Korea Appears To Be Officially Back In The Missile Test Firing Business,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It seemed sadly inevitable, but today it appears to have come to pass—North Korea has fired a number of short-range missiles from the resort city of Wonson along the country’s eastern shore. The test comes just two weeks after Kim Jong Un resumed high-profile inspections of military units and oversaw the test of a small tactical guided munition. It’s also the first firing of a missile with over-the-horizon range since November 28th, 2017, when Kim Jong Un personally oversaw the test of the Hwasong-15 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. What happened after the incredibly provocative act was a year and a half of detente driven by North Korea. It began with a sudden outreach from Pyongyang to Seoul regarding the 2018 Olympic Games. The U.S. followed suit and Kim declared his nuclear and missile goals accomplished for the time being and announced a new era where his focus would be on economic expansion. After a series of diplomatic exchanges and two faltered engagements at the highest level between Trump and Kim , nothing came in terms of tangible denuclearization. In fact, North Korea never even changed its long-standing language regarding denuclearization that isn’t even remotely similar to the White House’s goals. Meanwhile, South Korea’s Moon Jae In, who bet heavily on a new era of peace between South Korea and its estranged neighbor to the north, has continued to try to move the diplomatic process forward with weakening results. What did change is North Korea’s status on the world stage. Kim is now a world traveler who has renewed his precarious relationship with his country’s primary benefactor, China. Kim even met just recently with Vladimir Putin who has taken a new interest in North Korea and its elevated international status. Today’s launch also came after Trump and Putin talked on the phone about North Korea and as the Hermit Kingdom drastically cut back on food rations to its citizens. Kim had demanded that sanctions installed due to his nuclear and missile programs be lifted to improve the lives of his citizens even though he has been seen driving around his palaces in Pyongyang and abroad in a fleet of new armored limos, including Rolls Royces , Mercedes Maybachs . We cannot underestimate how big a message this is from North Korea. Trump had said Kim promised he wouldn’t start with the test firings again if the U.S. didn’t execute big military exercises with South Korea and continued with negotiations. Well, North Korea has since said it meant ICBMs only, while the U.S. meant all major missiles. In addition, even relatively small restructurings of South Korean-U.S. exercises has drawn extreme ire from the regime . But regardless, by breaking the moratorium now, it seems clear that Kim is ready to return to his old ways of getting attention. Today’s firing of short-range missiles, said to have flown between 70km and 200km, would be just about as predictable of an opening shot in renewed missile diplomacy as one can imagine from the rogue regime. As for the types of missiles tested, we just don’t know for certain at this time, but short-range ballistic missiles are possible, as are coastal-defense cruise missiles or even very long-range rocket artillery. The type does matter to some degree, as long as it wasn’t short range artillery or small tactical missiles, but the basic message is still the same—the short status quo is no longer going to be upheld unless Kim gets something in return. If he doesn’t, be prepared for more. As always, details could change in an instant. We will update this post when more information comes available.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 2, 2019","Right On Cue, Russia Says It’s Ready To Offer Turkey Su-57 Fighters In Place Of F-35s","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as The War Zone predicted a month ago , Russia has waded deeper into the rift between the U.S. and Turkey over the sale of Moscow’s S-400 air defense system to Ankara and the resulting U.S. embargo on F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to Turkey. The head of Russia’s top state-run industrial conglomerate Rostec has now stated it is ready to cooperate with Turkey on the export and production of their Su-57 advanced fighter jet to fill the hole left by the F-35. “These fifth-generation Russian fighter jets [the Su-57] have outstanding qualities, and show promise for export,” Rostec chief Sergey Chemezov said in an interview with Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency media outlet on May 2. He said that Russia was “ready to cooperate” on possible sales to Turkey of the jets if the country’s planned F-35 purchase order collapsed and added that the Kremlin would “gladly evaluate” the possibility of local production or transfer of certain technology to “support Turkey’s desire to develop its own defense industry.” As it sits now, if Turkey continues with its purchase of Russia’s S-400 system, instead of buying a Western alternative, such as the Patriot system from the United States, the country will not only be kept from receiving the 100 F-35As it has had on order for many years, but it could also lose its industrial participation in the program that is worth billions of dollars. With the S-400 delivery appearing imminent , this looks more likely to occur than not. JUST IN: Sergey Chemezov, Head of Rostec, company that expedited S400 deal, says #Russia ""ready to cooperate"" with #Turkey over production of Su57 fighters should #Ankara 's participation in the production of F-35 is suspended. pic.twitter.com/2BkaXsAGKX — Maxim A. Suchkov (@m_suchkov) May 3, 2019 President Recep Erdogan recently lambasted Washington’s decision to withhold Turkey’s F-35s over the S-400 deal, with Reuters quoting him as such: Speaking at a defense industry fair, Erdogan said those trying to exclude Turkey from the F-35 project had not thought the process through, and were ignoring its interests. “We were surely not going to remain silent against our right to self-defense being disregarded and attempts to hit us where it hurts,” Erdogan said. “This is the kind of process that is behind the S-400 agreement we reached with Russia.” “Nowadays, we are being subject to a similar injustice – or rather an imposition – on the F-35s … Let me be frank: An F-35 project from which Turkey is excluded is bound to collapse completely,” Erdogan said, adding that Turkey was also rapidly working to develop its own air defense systems. Turkey has at least eight major contractors involved in producing portions of the F-35, as well as associated systems, according to the prime contractor Lockheed Martin . These companies have been set to make billions from this work, significant industrial offsets for Turkey, who was one of the first foreign partners to join the Joint Strike Fighter program. Turkey’s Undersecretariat for Defense Industries says the country has supplied more than $700 million in parts and services so far. F-35 components that are produced by Turkey.

On top of that, the U.S. government has increasingly found itself in a broader dispute with its long-time NATO ally over a variety of issues. These including the detention of American citizens in the aftermath of a failed coup against Erdogan in 2016 and Turkey’s spurious allegations that members of the U.S. military personnel and other American officials were involved in that abortive attempt to overthrow the government. F-35A., Raytheron Members of Congress are already looking to make the embargo on selling the F-35 to Turkey over the S-400 permanent. Just on May 3, 2019 , members of the House of Representatives announced the proposed “Protecting NATO Skies Act of 2019,” which would do just this. This is a companion bill to one already making its way through the Senate . The Pentagon is already engaged in discussions with Lockheed Martin and other contractors about alternatives to Turkish suppliers to ensure there are no disruptions to the Joint Strike Fighter Program if Turkey ends up kicked out. He did reveal that he met with @LockheedMartin and @UTC leadership last week to discuss options to replace the work Turkish industry currently does on the F-35. Turkish companies supply key parts such as landing gear components and blade rotors. — Lara Seligman (@laraseligman) May 3, 2019 Until a formal ban comes into force, Turkey remains set to purchase 100 F-35s. So, it’s hardly surprising that Russia is interested in offering to fill in if the deal finally falls through completely. The cash-strapped Russians have struggled to support the Su-57 program as it is, taking delivery of less than a dozen pre-production examples of the jet between January 2010 and January 2018. Last year, the Kremlin announced that it would place an order for just 12 more aircraft and defer large-scale production of the type indefinitely. This followed news that India, Russia’s only foreign partner on the program, had abandoned the project. Now, curiously, Russia is reportedly not including any of its existing Su-57s in the upcoming annual May Day parade in Moscow that commemorates the country’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II and is an opportunity for the Kremlin to show off new weapon systems. The advanced fighter jets have made regular appearances at this event in recent years. A breakdown of the ground and aviation equipment that will take part in the Victory Day Parade across Red Square. I'm wondering how long we'll have to wait until we see UAVs and UGVs take part in a significant way (i.e. not being transported by trucks). https://t.co/kCdPY0XNLs pic.twitter.com/uJvpIMjgps — Rob Lee (@RALee85) May 3, 2019 There have been reports that Russia may be courting China as a potential new foreign partner in the Su-57, as well. It’s not clear if the Chinese, who have two different stealth fighter designs already flying , including one of which that is in service , would be interested in acquiring another advanced fighter jet.  At the same time, China has bought Su-35 Flanker Es despite also building other Flanker clones domestically and a Su-57 deal involving some amount of technology transfer, such as advanced jet engine technology, an area where China continues to lag behind its competitors, could be attractive. Regardless, Turkish involvement on a scale similar to the country’s participation in the F-35 program could still provide a much-needed cash infusion into the Su-57 program and could help support other associated developments, such as specialized ordnance . As Chemezov noted to Anadolu , Russia could offer a very attractive package that also includes industrial offsets and the potential for other local cooperation, including on Turkey’s own indigenous TF-X fighter jet effort. It’s important to note that the Su-57 is not on par with the F-35, but could also still offer an important boost in capabilities for the Turkish Air Force if all of its features work as intended. You can read more about the actual abilities of this often misunderstood aircraft in this past feature . UAC Aircraft Corporation As has been the case for months now, the biggest question remains just how far Turkey is willing to distance itself from the United States, as well as NATO, many members of which have also been critical of the S-400 purchase. Buying advanced Russian fighter jets could only compound Ankara’s strained relationship with the Alliance as a whole and could drive new efforts to block the country’s participation in other weapon system programs and other military cooperation efforts. This could further prompt calls for the U.S. military to discontinue its use of Incirlik air base , which hosts American nuclear weapons , as well as other American facilities across the country. With Turkey looking set to recieve S-400s soon and American legislators pushing toward making the embargo against selling F-35s to that country a matter of law, we may not have to wait much longer to see how Turkish authorities respond and whether the Turkish Air Force might end up forgoing its planned Joint Strike Fighter squadrons for units equipped with Russian Su-57s.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 23, 2019",Historic Northrop Flying Wing Crashed After Doing A “Barrel Roll” According To NTSB (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The tragic loss of the only Northrop N-9M flying wing in existence and its pilot Dave Vopat that occurred on April 22nd in Norco, California happened after the aircraft executed a barrel roll. You can read our past coverage on the crash and the history of the ultra-rare N-9M here . The National Transportation Safety Board’s preliminary report on the incident reads as such : On April 22, 2019, about 1210 Pacific daylight time, a Northrop N9M airplane, N9MB, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Norco, California. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the Planes of Fame Air Museum under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight. The local flight originated from the Chino Airport, Chino, California, about 1202. Multiple witnesses located near the accident site reported observing the airplane flying on a northeastern heading at a low altitude when it performed a “barrel roll.” Several witnesses reported that after the maneuver, the airplane “wobbled [from] side to side” before the airplane’s canopy separated. Shortly after, the airplane entered a steep right turn, and descended into the ground in a nose low attitude. Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted the outpatient housing yard of the California Rehabilitation Center. The debris path was about 474 ft in length, 200 ft wide, and oriented on a magnetic heading of about 124°. All major structural components of the airplane were observed within the wreckage debris path. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further examination. Flying wings have notorious stability issues. It wasn’t until digital fly-by-wire flight control systems became a reality that the concept could be implemented in an operational fashion in the form of the B-2A Spirit. I have never heard of the N-9M, an antique that was built in the 1940s, doing barrel rolls at air shows, although that is based on seeing the performance myself and watching videos of it in the past. Such a maneuver in that airframe sounds excessively risky, especially if it hadn’t been a staple maneuver that had been repeated many times over at altitude and cleared for air show routines in the past. The low altitude environment that the aircraft was flying in the time of the crash would have offered nearly zero chance of a safe recovery after a departure from controlled flight. N-9M in front of the Planes Of Fame hangar., Sylvain Mielot/wikicommons What we don’t know for certain at this time is if the maneuver was intentional or if some unknown circumstance caused a maneuver similar to a barrel roll before the aircraft departed completely from controlled flight. The N-9M was scheduled to be a star attraction of the Planes Of Fame air show in Chino this weekend. We will keep you up to date as more information from the crash investigation is released. Author’s Note 5/3/19 3:40pm PDT— I have received some very interesting correspondence about this tragic crash. Some who are close to the aircraft and its operators have noted that they have never heard of aerobatics of this kind being done in the aircraft and especially not at low-level. That is similar to my observations and knowledge about the aircraft and its operations as noted in the article. In addition, some believe that a catastrophic issue, like an engine failure while at a high power setting or a flight control issue, may have caused a maneuver that looked like a barrel roll, but was totally unintentional. Under such circumstances, it is possible the pilot partially recovered the aircraft before it flew into the ground. In other words, the pilot did everything they could to stabilize the situation, but it just wasn’t enough and the aircraft crashed. Any of these possibilities could very well be true, but all we have to go off of at this time is the preliminary NTSB report. The final report may take months or even longer to materialize and may not be fully conclusive in nature. Regardless, I think it is worth stressing these possibilities along with what the report directly states.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",This Ghost Of A Helicopter Likely Had A Secret Role In Reagan’s ‘Tear Down This Wall’ Speech,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days after then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan made his famous “ Tear down this wall! ” speech in West Berlin in June of 1987, German photographer Manfred Faber took a picture of a uniquely modified helicopter wearing an unassuming civilian paint job and carrying a U.S. civil registration code at Frankfurt Airport. Documents we have obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, along with information from other sources, point to this particular Hughes Little Bird being a part of one of the U.S. military’s most top-secret aviation units ever, formally called the 1st Rotary Wing Test Activity, but better known as Seaspray . We reached out to Mr. Faber, who was gracious enough to let us use his photograph for this story. You can find more of his work here . Unfortunately, he had no additional information on the helicopter, which had the registration N1111U at the time, or why it might have been in Frankfurt. Per information we obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the aircraft started life as a Hughes Model 369D, the manufacturer’s name for the OH-6D helicopter. This was an improved version of the Vietnam War-era OH-6A Cayuse light scout helicopter. The most obvious external improvements were the addition of a new five-blade main rotor in place of the original four-blade design and new T-shaped tail assembly. It also featured an improved Allison turboshaft engine. The resulting variant was significantly faster and more powerful than its predecessors. N1111U clearly took advantage of that additional capability to carry a variety of cutting edge equipment, turning it into something of a real-life analog to the fictional helicopter in the television show Airwolf . N1111U, a highly modified Hughes 369D., Manfred Faber A night-flying, covert transport Under the nose, N1111U has what appears to be a Hughes AN/AAQ-16 forward-looking infrared (FLIR) turret, which can capture infrared full motion video during the day and night and in most any weather conditions. After acquiring the rights to the design, Raytheon Systems Company continued producing versions of this system into the 1990s and it was a standard feature on early U.S. Army special operations MH-47 Chinooks and MH-60 Black Hawks , as well as U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters. The helicopter also has a plank on the side that special operators could ride on, which also doubles as an extended range fuel tank. A center spar running through the small rear cabin would connect this assembly to another plank on the opposite side of the aircraft. There are also three large blade antennas under the nose, which are typically associated with high-frequency radios and other communications systems. A round “cake pan” antenna on the helicopter’s boom is indicative of an early satellite communications system or satellite navigation system. There are also missile approach warning detectors on the nose. These are typically found on aircraft meant to fly into or through contested airspace. There may be additional internal components, including in the exhaust system, to dampen the aircraft’s infrared signature to help protect it from short-range heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles, but the area where a side-mounted infrared-dampening exhaust port would be is blanked off on this aircraft. There are various other less obvious specialized features on N1111U, including “slime lights” and a small infrared light on the tail for night formation flying. The helicopter also has the mounting points above the rear door for the Fast Rope Insertion Extraction System, or FRIES , which would allow individuals on the planks to quickly rappel into an area if the helicopter could not find a suitable landing spot. An MH-6 Little Bird from the US Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment carries special operators on side-mounted planks and has the FRIES equipment installed to allow them to rappel down once the helicopter reaches its objective. In 1987, N1111U was configured for similar operations., US Army We can’t say for sure whether N1111U had a night vision goggle compatible cockpit configuration or not. Given the helicopter’s other night-flying features and the experience the U.S. military had gained from its abortive attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980, it seems more than plausible that the pilots would have trained to fly it while using NVGs by 1987. Taken together, the helicopter looks state-of-the-art for its time and particularly well configured to insert small numbers of special operators discreetly, even in the dead of night, into very confined spaces. Its civilian style paint job would have helped it avoid unwanted attention and allowed it to hide in plain sight to some degree, especially at busy major airports such as the one in Frankfurt. These are all features that one might also expect to find on early MH-6 Little Birds that the U.S. Army’s elite Task Force 160 operated after its activation in 1981. That unit eventually evolved into the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment we know today. The Hughes 369D also benefited from improvements Hughes had developed for the commercial Model 500, which McDonnell Douglas produced after acquiring Hughes in 1984 as the MD 500 or Defender. Further improved variants of the Little Bird design continue to serve with the 160th . Except we know that this helicopter wasn’t part of the 160th. The video below of an MH-6 from the US Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment shows off the speed and agility of the Little Bird platform. Corporate shell-game and a top secret unit Around the same time that the Army created Task Force 160 in 1981, in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency, it formed Seaspray. This organization’s mission was specifically to carry out “black” covert and clandestine missions, often in cooperation with equally top-secret Army units such as Delta Force and the Intelligence Support Activity . An organization that officials referred to broadly as the “Special Operations Division” oversaw all of these units. Journalist Steven Emerson, in his 1988 book Secret Warriors : Inside the Covert Military Operations of the Reagan Era , describes the formation of Seaspray in this way: “The [Special Operations] Division’s final step in creating Seaspray was to establish a commercial ‘cover,’ so that it could fly classified missions without being recognized as part of the U.S. military. Seaspray became integrated into a CIA proprietary company. Aviation Tech Services, that allowed Seaspray helicopters to appear to be part of a private company. Aviation Tech Services also provided liability protection for Seaspray.” Because the military is severely restricted in setting up incorporated proprietaries, it turned to the CIA, which is not encumbered by such Congressional restrictions. Seaspray itself was headquartered at Fort Eustis, Virginia, and innocuously named the First Rotary Wing Test Activity as an internal Army cover. Another secret Seaspray headquarters was located in Tampa, in order to support Central American operations.” According to the documents we obtained from the FAA, in February 1981, none other than Aviation Technical Services purchased N1111U direct from Hughes. The registration was originally linked to an address in Miami, Florida, further south of Tampa. In September 1981, the address of the registration changed to a location in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. This city sits 80 miles west of the Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity, a collection of facilities commonly associated with the CIA and covert U.S. military operations. Before setting out on the raid that ultimately killed Osama Bin Laden in May 2011, SEAL Team Six operators trained on a full-scale mockup of the Al Qaeda leader’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan at Harvey Point. One of N1111U registration’s, showing Aviation Technical Services’ address in Rocky Mount, North Carolina., FAA via FOIA In October 1981, Aviation Technical Services changed the address on the helicopter’s registration yet again, this time to Fort Eustis proper. That was still the case when Manfred Faber caught a glimpse of N1111U in Germany on June 18, 1987. We, unfortunately, have no idea what the helicopter might have been doing in the interim. The existence of Seaspray came out in 1985 as a result of the Iran-Contra scandal and the unit reportedly had conducted missions in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua in support of various covert activities in Central America. Seaspray also reportedly used one of its Little Birds to ferry Lebanese Christian leader Bashir Gemayel from Beirut to a secondary location as part of a secret trip to Washington, D.C. in 1981. As part of their efforts to neutralize the Palestinian Liberation Organization and other terrorist groups in Lebanon, the United States and Israel supported Gamayel and his organization, known as the Phalange . This group subsequently became infamous for massacring hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese Shia Muslims in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in 1982. A copy of N1111U registration when Aviation Technical Services listed the address as being at Fort Eustis, Virginia., FAA via FOIA Why Germany? While we don’t have any specific information as to what this Seaspray helicopter was doing in Germany in 1987, it’s highly probable that it, along with other U.S. military forces and elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community, was supporting Reagan’s historic trip. Making his speech in Berlin, then a divided city deep inside East Germany, which had been a playground for espionage and other clandestine activities for decades, was a major security risk in of itself. The U.S. government would have been concerned, at least at some level, that the Soviets or the East Germans might seek to assassinate the president or otherwise violently disrupt his speech, potentially seeking out proxies to try to do so in a more deniable fashion. West German leftist groups had organized to oppose Reagan’s visit and thousands of protesters descended on West Berlin to demonstrate. Militant organizations such as the Red Army Faction remained active and there was the growing threat of international terrorism, as well. On top of that, the Reagan administration had blamed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his government directly for a bombing in West Berlin in 1986 that killed three people, including two U.S. Army soldiers. That incident led to punitive air strikes, nicknamed Operation El Dorado Canyon , against Libya later in the year. The Libyan dictator survived those strikes, but he claimed that his adoptive infant daughter Hana had died in the raid, which remains a source of controversy . Regardless, Gaddafi vowed to continue supporting terrorist groups, such as the Red Army Faction, and pursue retaliatory action against the United States himself. All told, it is not hard to imagine that U.S. officials decided to keep Seaspray helicopters and a team of Delta Force operators, in addition to various other forces, on standby in West Germany. If any crisis had erupted, Reagan could have ended up effectively stranded inside East Germany and this helicopter and other assets could have rushed in to extract him if necessary. Of course, Frankfurt is more than 250 miles southwest of Berlin, so it is possible that N1111U wasn’t staged there during the actual speech, though the extended range fuel tanks would have helped the small helicopter cover that distance if necessary. In addition, Faber did take his picture four days after the speech, so it’s also possible that the force that included elements from Seaspray was in the process of redeploying back to the United States. Where is the helicopter now? We don’t know what has happened to N1111U since it appeared in Germany. It is possible that the entire operation raised the profile of the helicopter, and others that participated in the mission, whatever it actually was, to the point of needing a new cover story. In August 1987, Aviation Technical Services sold the aircraft, along with two other Hughes Model 369Ds, to Atlantic Air Associates. The company re-registered N1111U as N9159A to an address in Arlington Virginia, within spitting distance of CIA headquarters. The other two Little Birds had the N-numbers N7299A and N9166A. The August 1987 letter from Atlantic Air Associates informing the FAA that it had purchased three Hughes 369Ds, including N9159A, the ex-N1111U., FAA via FOIA In August 1991, Atlantic Air Associates sold the helicopter again, to a company called the Franklin Air Company in Baltimore, Maryland. It changed registration numbers in the process, becoming N26RV. In January 1992, Franklin Air sent the helicopter to Summit Aviation in Delaware, another company with long-standing links to the CIA, to receive a Robertson Aviation HA-010 Range Extension Fuel Tank System, according to an airworthiness notice the company sent to the FAA. Then, in August 1992, the firm reassigned the N26RV N-number to a Hughes Model 369F, suggesting it had converted the helicopter to a more modern version entirely. In 2013, it disappears from the U.S. civil register altogether. Atlantic Air Associates and Franklin Air Company have zero formal web presence. The Atlantic Air Associates address the FAA had on file points to a nondescript office building. Franklin Air Company was supposedly running its operations out of a strip mall. A description of the work that Summit Aviation performed on N26RV in 1992., FAA via FOIA What happened to Seaspray? Seaspray no longer exists under that name, either. The unit eventually came under the direct control of the Intelligence Support Activity, becoming known as the Flight Concepts Division (FCD). In 1989, the Army officially stopped using the Intelligence Support Activity moniker for that organization, which has reportedly taken on a number of other cover designations since then. You can read more about how the FCD fits into the U.S. military’s top-secret special operations aviation communities here , but suffice to say, it remains one of the U.S. military’s most closely guarded secrets. An undated job posting for a position at Fort Eustis noted that the base fire chief couldn’t even get into the organization’s main hangar – which sits behind two layers of fencing and has its own gate to the taxiway – for emergency planning purposes. “Research activities are also conducted by the Flight Concepts Division that is highly secret and access for pre-planning purpose is non-existent” the same notice explained. “Nature of their work is known to be hazardous.” Images of flooding inside FCD’s offices at Felker Army Airfield, at left, and outside, at right, during Hurricane Isabel in 2003. These may be the only official publicly available official photographs of any of the unit’s facilities., US Army The unit has reportedly flown a wide variety of U.S.- and foreign-made aircraft over the years and has been involved in modifying those aircraft for highly specialized missions. The most notable that the FCD has reportedly had a direct hand in the development of the famous “Stealth Hawk,” a heavily updated MH-60 Black Hawk with various stealthy features, one of which crashed during the Bin Laden raid in Pakistan in 2011. The unit’s pilots may have actually flown that mission and they maintain a very close working relationship with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Publicly available satellite imagery of Fort Eustis’ Felker Army Airfield has long been devoid of Little Birds and there is evidence FCD might have traded them for Bell 407 helicopters , or another type of helicopter with only four blades on its main rotor, for unknown reasons in recent years. This might help explain the departure of N26RV from the civil register in 2013. A satellite image showing a portion of Felker Army Airfield at Fort Eustis in 2015, with a number of small helicopters with four-blade main rotors at the lower left that appear to be Bell 407 helicopters.

In his book Relentless Strike : The Secret History of Joint Special Operations Command , journalist Sean Naylor says that some or all of that entity eventually turned into E Squadron, Delta Force. The FCD remained in existence at Fort Eustis’ Felker Army Airfield publicly until at least 2016 and is in the process of getting a number of new facilities, including a new main hangar and a completely separate ramp. The Army has reportedly now renamed it the Aviation Technology Office , or ATO. An annotated satellite map showing the planned expansion of FCD’s presence at Felker Army Airfield as of 2014., US Army Depending on where the ATO is still using Little Birds at all, and what condition N26RV might be in after more than three decades of covert operations, Manfred Faber’s picture may turn out to be one of, if not the only image of this extremely rare helicopter to ever emerge into the public eye.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 1, 2020",The Air Force Just Shot Down Multiple Missiles With A Laser Destined For Fighter Aircraft,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has revealed that a ground-based surrogate for a laser weapon system that could protect American fighter jets and other aircraft from incoming threats in the future has successfully shot down multiple air-launched missiles in a test. The service’s publicly stated goal is to have a podded prototype system ready for actual flight tests by 2021 and an actual operational capability by the end of the decade. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) conducted the test on Apr. 23, 2019 , at the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, together with defense contractor Lockheed Martin, which is developing the laser. Lockheed Martin first received the contract to build the directed energy weapon in 2017 as part of AFRL’s Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program. The laser component, or Laser Advancements for Next-generation Compact Environments (LANCE), is just one part of the SHiELD effort. Work on a turreted mount and a self-contained pod to attach the complete system to a fighter jet-sized aircraft are separate as part of the SHiELD Turret Research in Aero Effects (STRAFE) and Laser Pod Research & Development (LPRD) projects, respectively. “The successful test is a big step ahead for directed energy systems and protection against adversarial threats,” U.S. Air Force Major General William Cooley, head of AFRL, said in an official statement . “The ability to shoot down missiles with speed of light technology will enable air operation in denied environments.” There’s a lot we still don’t know about this test, including any sort of details on the basic parameters, such as whether or not the operators manning the laser knew when and where the missiles above would get launched and at what altitude and under what atmospheric conditions. The Air Force also did not say what kind of missiles it had used and whether it intended them to be representative of any particular real-world threat. Still, demonstrating the ability of the laser to spot, track, engage, and destroy multiple aerial targets is still a very important step forward in SHiELD’s development. A very low-res image the Air Force released of Lockheed Martin’s surrogate laser, also known as the Demonstrator Laser Weapon System (DLWS)., USAF If the Air Force is employing a system capable of engaging multiple targets, they may be beyond the low power stage. However, at least as of 2016, the service did not expect the Phase II high power tests to involve a surrogate laser. The second phase was also supposed to mark the beginning of putting all the pieces of an actual prototype together for the first time. This schedule, of course, could have changed in the past three years. The Air Force eventually wants SHiELD to be able to shoot down incoming air-to-air missiles, as well as surface-to-air missiles, providing an active defense for fighter jets during operations in high-risk environments. The service has already suggested, not surprisingly, that the system could also find its way onto larger, slower-moving combat and combat support aircraft, such as bombers , tankers , and transport planes , to mitigate the threat from ever-improving missiles cued by steadily more advanced radars and other sensors . An artist’s conception of a future fight jet shooting down a threat with a laser., Lockheed Martin It’s not entirely clear where in the testing process the SHiELD program is based on this particular test. As of 2016, AFRL had broken the test plan into three distinct phases, according to a briefing The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. Though much of the document was redacted, it did show that Phase I was supposed to include both low-power ground testing, as well as low-power flight testing, both involving a surrogate laser, strongly suggesting that this is where the Air Force is in the process right now. You can see a partial description of the ground-based testing plan below. Air Force censors entirely redacted a detailed description of the Phase I flight tests. USAF via FOIA With ground testing apparently proceeding as planned, we may not be far from the initial flight testing of the surrogate laser. We don’t know what platform the Air Force and Lockheed Martin might use for those tests, but the defense contractor did use a modified Dassault Falcon 10 business jet to carry a turreted laser for a previous program known as Aero-Adaptive, Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC). AFRL ran the ABC project together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which you can read about more here . In 2014, this experimental system demonstrated advanced adaptive focusing and stabilization capabilities. AFRL says that previous directed energy weapon projects, such as ABC, have already helped inform work on SHiELD, which will need the ability to automatically stabilize and control the beam’s focal point. The Dassault 10 ABC turret test bed., USAF SHiELD will also need to be able to modulate its power to ensure that it has the best possible chance of neutralizing threats under any conditions. The range and power of lasers, as well as many other directed energy weapons, is highly sensitive to atmospheric conditions, including clouds and smoke, which can break up the beam. With that in mind, it’s important to note that, apart from work on the laser, SHiELD’s first phase is also supposed to include the successful demonstration of “beam control, power, cooling, and system control in flight qualified pod.” Lockheed Martin’s contract announcement seemed to be focused largely on the laser component and it is unclear who might be developing the LPRD pod or the STRAFE turret. USAF via FOIA By the service’s own admission , the main challenge now is for Lockheed Martin to miniaturize the surrogate laser it is using now so that it will fit and work properly inside a reasonably sized pod. But solid-state laser technology has been improving for years already. At the time of Lockheed Martin’s SHiELD contract award in 2017, the company had already delivered a 60-kilowatt laser to the U.S. Army for ground-based testing, as well. That same year, an Army AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter used a podded solid-state laser from Raytheon to destroy targets at White Sands. The U.S. Navy has also been actively developing laser weapons for its ships , too, and there have been numerous tests of laser weapons in the past two years across the services. In addition, the Air Force has clear incentives to ensure SHiELD is a success. It’s hard to stress just how revolutionary a podded laser defense system would be for virtually any military aircraft. Unlike expendable countermeasures such as hot-burning flares or radar-blinding chaff , or electronic warfare systems , a laser weapon actively zeroes in on an incoming missile rather than simply throwing out some form of distracting noise to try to confuse the threat. A directed energy weapon also has an effectively bottomless magazine. That’s not to say that SHiELD, at least as described presently, doesn’t have limitations. A turreted laser can only ever engage one target at a time and there is the aforementioned risk of atmospheric disruptions reducing the beam’s range and efficacy. Any future laser missile defense system is likely to just be part of a layered self-protection suite on future aircraft that could include a mix of other advanced options, including improved electronic warfare jammers , towed decoys , hard-kill interceptors , and more. There’s really no reason why SHiELD, or a derivative thereof, could not be used in an offensive role during within visual range air combat against other actual aircraft or as an air-to-ground weapon against soft targets . A defensive podded laser weapon could also serve as a starting place for a purpose-built offensive system, too. In October 2018 , AFRL announced it was looking for companies that might have proposals for a high-energy laser or high-powered microwave directed energy weapon for “precision airborne offensive strike” missions, as well as defensive roles, separate from the SHiELD effort. In addition, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) had been talking about adding an offensive laser capability on its AC-130J Ghostrider gunships by 2022, though it appears that this timeline has gotten pushed back . If everything stays on schedule, the Air Force is still around two years out from demonstrating a full prototype of the podded SHiELD system on a fighter jet-sized aircraft. But this latest test at White Sands shows the program is on track to making this game-changing capability a reality.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 20, 2018",Air Force Considering Making Its Next Tanker A Drone With A Podded Refueling Boom,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force’s top acquisition official says that the next-generation aerial refueling tanker, commonly referred to as KC-Z , will very likely be unmanned. This comes as the service’s latest budget request reveals plans to develop and test a podded refueling boom that could go on a future tanker drone. Aviation Week was first to report these developments on Mar. 21, 2019, after an interview with Will Roper, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. The details on the podded boom project were inside a line item covering “Next Generation Aerodynamic Technologies” in documentation related to the Air Force’s most recent budget request for Fiscal Year 2020, which the service made publicly available on Mar. 18, 2019. “We can see it in the tea leaves,” Roper told Aviation Week about the future tanker. “If KC-Z isn’t autonomous, I’ll be really surprised.” The Air Force has not publicly announced firm requirements for KC-Z, though it was set to complete a capabilities-based assessment of the program by the end of 2018, according to Aviation Week . This assessment would help the service determine what it is actually looking for in a future tanker. A Lockheed Martin model of a conceptual KC-Z advanced tanker aircraft., Joseph Trevithick Earlier in March 2019, U.S. Air Force General Maryanne Miller, head of Air Mobility Command, said it would take another year for the service to lay out its desired capabilities for KC-Z. She added that it was too early to say if the aircraft would be manned or unmanned and said it wouldn’t be stealthy, according to Air Force Magazine . In January 2019, Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein had also made a bizarre claim that the next tanker might operate in space. But KC-Z, which the Air Force plans to have in production by 2027, will have to incorporate design elements to protect it from the ever-increasingly capable integrated air defenses , advanced combat aircraft , and supporting sensors and networks that America’s “great power” competitors, such as Russia and China are developing for themselves and, in some cases, looking to export . Traditional airliner-derived tankers, such the Air Force’s KC-135s , KC-10s , and new KC-46A Pegasuses , will only become more vulnerable and need to operate further away from the actual fighting as time goes on. Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus., USAF In addition, modern combat aircraft have proven to be fuel hungry and stealth combat jets, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, cannot carry extra gas in drop tanks and remain in their full-stealth mode. Even that added fuel would not be able to take the place of having tankers on call, especially for missions penetrating deep into enemy territory. This makes it hard to imagine that KC-Z, which the Air Force expects to be working together with its future sixth generation Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) combat aircraft, will be able to avoid operating in higher-risk areas entirely. The War Zone has repeatedly highlighted the need for a stealth tanker to meet these threats and features that will reduce the aircraft’s radar and infrared signatures still seem like very important features to have. Other self-protection capabilities, such as advanced electronic warfare systems and hard-kill anti-missile systems, which use either physical interceptors or directed energy weapons , are also in development now, as well. These could potentially be used instead of a low-observable design, but there are still big tradeoffs in terms of survivability in certain scenarios—like penetrating into or very near contested airspace for any significant period of time—by eschewing a stealthy airframe design. A balanced approach, where some low-observability is packaged with these other capabilities may be optimal. We already know that the Air Force has been evaluating manned designs with hybrid and blended wing body planforms from Boeing and Lockheed Martin as possible starting places for KC-Z for years. According to our sources, the Air Force also once investigated turning Northrop Grumman’s B-2 stealth bomber into a tanker and that company’s forthcoming B-21 Raider could potentially serve as the basis for a “KB-21” aerial refueler. Unfortunately, the need for an aerial refueling boom, the Air Force’s primary means of mid-air refueling, also presents significant challenges for an aircraft trying to keep a stealthy profile. This is where a tanker drone might come in. Back in September 2018, a representative of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division told The War Zone that the company had proposed a fleet of smaller tanker drones as an alternative concept. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor had already developed a small unmanned aerial refueler design as part of its bid for the Navy’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone program. Boeing ultimately won that contract with a stealthy pilotless aircraft . A fleet of smaller unmanned tankers could support a more distributed aerial refueling concept that supports aircraft in higher risk areas and also makes it more difficult for an opponent to hunt down and eliminate the refuelers. These tanker drones might also work in concert with manned stealthy or non-stealthy tankers, with the larger aircraft refilling the unmanned ones in lower-risk areas forming a sort of high-tech bucket brigade to refuel jets in more densely defended areas. Operating a mixed fleet that includes larger, manned platforms would help ensure that the Air Force doesn’t lose the often overlooked, but important cargo-carrying capabilities of its present aerial refueling tankers, too. The Air Force also plans to begin work on a podded aerial refueling boom system in the 2020 Fiscal Year, according to its latest budget request. The service will “initiate the design of a small, pod-mounted tactical air refueling boom for future Mobility applications,” the budget documents explain. The Navy’s future MQ-25 Stingrays will also use a podded system, but one that supports the far less mechanically complex probe-and-drogue refueling method. Depending on the configuration of this podded boom, it might be possible for the carrying platform to keep it stowed in a less conspicuous and stealthier manner until necessary, helping to keep the aircraft concealed from enemy defenses. Existing drones with stealthy features, such as General Atomics’ Avenger , already feature retractable sensor turrets and internal payload bays to keep as low-observable as possible during transit to and from a specific location and while operating over contested territory. There have been proposals for stealthy weapons pods or conformal payload bays as means to reduce the radar signature of non-stealthy combat jets in the past, as well. Boeing’s Advanced Super Hornet demonstrator carrying a stealthy weapons pod., Boeing The boom, by itself, allows for a faster transfer rate , reducing the total time the tanker and the receiver aircraft would have to be linked together and more vulnerable. Boom-equipped tankers can also more rapidly refuel a larger number of receiver aircraft. Still, refueling a manned, or possibly unmanned aircraft, from a boom on a drone might present its own challenges, something Assistant Secretary Roper acknowledged while talking with Aviation Week . The Air Force has already successfully demonstrated that a drone can refuel via boom from a manned tanker, but conducting the procedure in reverse, as well as just building a boom that fits in a pod at all, could be a tall order. Booms have to be robust and allow for delicate, precise movement, telescoping in and out and being able to traverse over a relatively wide field of movement. A boom striking or scraping the receiving aircraft wouldn’t be great to begin with, but for stealth aircraft, which have sensitive coatings to help reduce their radar signature, it could be especially problematic. This has already been a problem with the remote-operated boom on the new KC-46A. A Learjet from Calspan Aerospace, operating in an autonomous mode as a surrogate for an unmanned aircraft, approaches a KC-135 tanker’s boom during a test in 2012., USAF An autonomous refueling procedure where both aircraft would digitally “talk” via data links and join up automatically could be essential if the podded boom is shorter and has less flexibility. But it’s a set of systems that would have to work extremely reliably to support actual combat missions where the transfer of fuel can literally mean life or death or a critical mission’s success or failure. On top of that, a single smaller drone would not come anywhere close to being able to fill the tanks of the Air Force’s largest aircraft, including heavy bombers such as the B-21 and transports like the C-17. There could also be concerns about the increased risk of dangerous physical interactions between smaller drone and a larger receiver aircraft, and the potential for major accidents as a result, during refueling. All of this could limit its utility for these larger “customers.” Roper added that the experience with the much-troubled KC-46A Pegasus tanker program , a saga you can read about in more detail here , was also laying the groundwork for drone carrying a boom that an actual person might operate remotely. This is an arrangement that would also require very robust data links to ensure its reliability. The KC-46A’s Remote Vision System (RVS) system to operate the boom has proven to be far less than reliable itself. Unlike previous Air Force tankers, where a boom operator lays in the rear and guides the boom into the receiving aircraft, the KC-46A puts this individual in the main cabin, where they use the RVS to perform this task. The RVS consists of a number of cameras positioned at the rear of the plane that produces a stereoscopic video feed that blends two-dimensional and three-dimensional imagery together. The video below shows elements of Boeing’s KC-46 simulator, which includes a simulated version of the RVS. This was supposed to give the boom operator a high-fidelity and extremely accurate understanding of the situation. In practice, this has been anything but the case and Boeing has now agreed to completely redesign the system, work that both it and the Air Force expect will take around two years to complete. But “in fixing the RVS we now have the knowledge in the Air Force to know how to go out and request an autonomous tanker,” Roper told Aviation Week . “Not just say, ‘give it to us,’ but specifically put on contract what we want to see.” Roper has been a major advocate for the increased development of unmanned capabilities across the Air Force in general, too. Less than two weeks ago he announced a new initiative to develop an advanced artificial intelligence system, called Skyborg , that could eventually support a fleet of “fighter-like” drones. Any future unmanned tanker could find itself working together with a mix of manned and unmanned platforms, as well. It’s important to note that while the Air Force is working on defining what it actually wants from KC-Z, it is also looking at outsourcing a large part of its air-to-air refueling requirements. In December 2018, Lockheed Martin and Airbus announced they would be collaborating to pitch various proposals to the service, including ones based on leased or contractor-owned and operated A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft. This raises questions about the exact tanker fleet mix the Air Force will want in the future and whether it might favor purchasing smaller systems, such as an unmanned platform, versus larger types going forward. Investing in a new tanker drone design and procuring a significant number of them could mean buying fewer additional large aerial refuelers, resulting in less capacity to support bigger bomber and cargo aircraft. A contractor-operated solution might make even more sense then to help ease the strain on the Air Force’s organic airliner-sized tankers. With the Air Force in the process of ironing out the KC-Z requirements now, we will hopefully be getting more details about the program’s objectives and the possible aircraft configurations and force mix in the near future. But the chances that it will at least include an unmanned component seem to be growing by the day.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 7, 2019",Amazing Video Of Blacked Out Night Stalker Helicopters Buzzing Low Over Downtown LA Street,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. New video has emerged from yesterday’s special operations forces realistic training exercise right in downtown Los Angeles , California. We have never seen MH-6 Little Birds from the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment fly so low during one of these urban warfare drills that occur in cities that are very much going about its usual business, a feat made all the more impressive given the rain and wind at the time. The Los Angeles Police Department issued a public statement about the exercise late on Feb. 4, 2019, as it was going on, with MH-6s, as well as MH-60 Black Hawks, carrying special operators through the skies of L.A. There may be more drills yet to come through Feb. 9, 2019, across the greater Los Angeles and Long Beach areas, according to the press release. But some residents didn’t need a press release to tell them the helicopters would be flying by, as the video below shows. If the people on the street weren’t aware of what was going on at the time, they certainly got a surprise as a pair of blacked out MH-6s went buzzing by at extremely low altitude. Separately, an MH-60 touched down in the middle of the street to pick up a number of special operators as they rushed out of a building. News crews had already spotted Black Hawks and Little Birds depositing forces on top of various structures, where they would have worked there way down to the assigned objective before exiting at street level. This is all in a days work for the 160th SOAR, which specializes in exactly these sorts of insertion and extraction missions, enabling special operators to get right on top of their targets quickly before the enemy can react and then out again safely. The MH-6’s diminutive size is ideal for getting personnel in and out of particularly hard to reach spots . Given the rain and wind, it must’ve been a particularly exciting ride for the occupants of the MH-6s, especially since the personnel were riding externally on the helicopter’s side-mounted planks. Piloting a helicopter in this kind of weather is no easy feat even without having to contend with the many potential hazards on the street in a major American metropolis, which includes unpredictable winds caused by highrises, all types of wires, tight spaces between structures and obstacles, and even circulating debris. The flying you can see in these various clips is just another testament to the skill of pilots assigned to the 160th SOAR. The videos are also good examples of why there is simply no substitute for this kind of hyper-realistic training in a real urban environment, even though it might give residents a brief scare. And let’s be honest here, if you saw blacked out helicopters with silhouettes of soldiers hanging out the side flying down a metropolis street at treetop level, you probably would be freaked out too. The U.S. military as a whole, as well as local authorities, always has to balance the clear demand for this type of realistic training with the equally obvious disruption the drills often cause to civilians. You can read about these issues in detail here and here . We’ll definitely be keeping our eyes out for more clips of Monday’s exercise, as well as others that occur as the week goes on.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 14, 2019",Family Says Land Overlooking Area 51 Is Worth $116M—USAF Says $330k,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last year I shared “ The Unlikely Story Of The Family Whose Neighbor Is Area 51 ,” an amazing saga that spanned more than 130 years. It included the pioneering American spirit, the dawn of the nuclear age and the horrific weapons tests that went along with it, a family’s love for their heritage, and most ominously, the most famous secret installation in the world—the USAF’s sprawling flight test center at Groom Lake —better known as Area 51. When we last left the Sheahan family they were at odds with the USAF, who had just made their “final offer” of $5.2 million for their very unique property. Now, a year later, the land has been seized by the Air Force and a bitter legal battle between the two parties is well underway. Both the Air Force and Sheahans have obtained appraisals for the family’s roughly 400 acres of land and mining claims situated across the Groom dry lake bed from Area 51. The results of those appraisals could not be any more disparate. The Sheahan’s estimators put the value of the property at between $44 million and $116 million. Meanwhile the USAF has come back with another value that they are now willing to pay the family, that being just $333,300, or roughly six and a half percent of their last offer. The War Zone Spoke to Joe Sheahan, one of the 22 family members leading up the effort to get compensated for their property, as well as their attorney James Leavitt of the law firm Kermitt L. Waters out of Las Vegas. Joe’s perspective on the AIr Force’s latest figure is stark: “We’ve gone from their $2.4 million offer, then their $5.2 (million) take-it-or-leave-it offer, to when they, in a rush, filed the paperwork to take the property. They deposited $1.2 million, and a federal judge signed the property over to them at that time. Now we’re down to $333,300. It’s David and Goliath, and Goliath is going to stomp you into the ground. That’s their goal.” Leavitt summed up his evaluation of the Air Force’s relatively tiny dollar figure as such: “On September 10, 2015 the federal government obtained title to the property, as of that date or shortly thereafter. Therefore, in order to gain access, we had to get permission in order to go back onto the property, because title had indeed vested in the federal government. We took all of our experts out to the property. They had the opportunity to inspect it for an entire day, and after they inspected it, that was one of the portions, an important part of their appraisal analysis was the fact that this is an incredibly unique and special purpose property, and they included that within their analysis. The federal government’s experts were also permitted in July of this year to go onto the property to inspect it also. We believe that they did not recognize the incredibly unique nature and special purpose of the property.” Leavitt added, “They’ve hired an appraiser which they consider to be independent. They’ve hired that appraiser, and he’s provided to them a report. He’s provided to them his documents and information which he believes support the $333,300 number. Again, we vehemently disagree with that amount. We vehemently oppose that it even approaches just compensation. You can see that the government has been all over the place in this case. They first offered $2.4 million. Then they offered $5.2 million. Then when the lawsuit was filed, the government offered $1.2 million, and now as we’ve progressed through this litigation, the government’s number now is down to $333,300.” The main camp area at the Sheahan’s Groom Mine property located just across the Groom dry lake bed from Area 51. , Sheahan Family Much of the disparity between what the family says the property is worth and what the Air Force says it is worth comes from how property’s past, present and its future potential are viewed. It has what many would argue is the most fascinating and exclusive view of any piece of private property in the world—a panoramic and remarkably close-up vista of what is nearly the unseeable, Area 51. At the same time, that view, and its location inside the most restricted territory on planet, also limits not only what could go on there, but who could even access the property and when. Land withdrawals over the last few decades have resulted in the Sheahan’s property becoming a tiny island surrounded by a huge sea of of dirt and rock controlled by the federal government. Much of that land is totally inaccessible to civilians—even to most of the military for that matter—including all the property for miles surrounding Groom Mine. Attorney James Leavitt describes this bizarre situation: “In 1984, when the Air Force attempted to withdraw land around the Groom Lake property here, and the Groom Mine property, they tried to withdraw approximately 89,000 acres. When they attempted to do that, they attempted to do it in an illegal manner, got caught, and several representatives from the state of Nevada went to Congress and testified on behalf of the people of the state of Nevada and on behalf of the Sheahan family. During those hearings, and subsequent to those hearings, the Air Force recognized, and even put in writing, that the Sheahan family owned that property as private owners, number one, and number two, are the only individuals who are permitted to access that property with their business visitors. That was the exact language used in the letters. What that did is it created a unique niche. It created a very very unique parcel of property, whereby the Sheahans and the people they invited were the only ones that could go into that valley and have an unobstructed view of Area 51.” Groom Mine is not just some obscure inherited tract of land to Sheahan family, their roots on the property go back well over a century. For the the first half of the 20th Century the family ran a successful mining operation there. At the start of World War II the federal government came into play, surveying the area for military training operations, and they did so with the Sheahan’s help. Groom Mine dates back to the late 19th Century, with the site being quite active for the first half of the 20th Century. Then the government showed up and things began to change in the most bizarre ways possible., Sheahan Family Soon after, machine gun fire from aircraft began raking the mine, and in January of 1951 the nuclear tests began just a handful of miles to the west, strewing fallout over their property and making living at the mine a serious challenge and very likely a major health risk. These tests would continue on a regular basis over the decade. Eventually the base that we know now as Area 51 would sprout up on the dry lakebed below the mine. It was there that in the late 1950s the CIA and Lockheed’s Skunkworks began testing the U-2 Spyplane . But shortly before this time, the Sheahans have long claimed that their main ore processing facility at Groom Mine was literally bombed from the air. In their eyes this incident was no accident and they have supporting documents from back then and from today that seems to support their claim. With mining operations all but impossible to execute, and with a never-ending legal battle in front of them, Groom Mine turned into a part-time retreat for the Sheahans from around 1960 on. A nuclear test executed at the National Test Site during the 1950s as seen from the Sheahan’s property just 20 miles away.  To the left in the frame, at the base of the moutains is where the flight test center at Area 51 sits today., Sheahan Family As the base grew the security around it became much more intense. The family claims to have been held at gunpoint, sometimes inside structures on their own property, by security personnel associated with the installation. All this is described in great detail in my previous piece , but to say the least, the relationship between the Air Force and the Sheahans has been, at times, contentious. This bizarre past, along with the exotic nature of Groom Mine’s neighbor and the inaccessibility of the property because of that neighbor have made for a unique property rights legal case to say the least. The Sheahan’s appraisals included not just the normal things you would associate with valuing a piece of property, such as parcel size, improvements, mineral deposits, mining claims, and access to water, but also reflected what the Air Force made their property into. Counselor Leavitt describes how this impacted their value estimates: “What we did, is we went and we did surveys, and we had an organization out of Florida prepare a demand study to determine what the demand in this country is to enter into a property such as the Sheahan family property, which has an unobstructed view of Area 51, and which is the only privately held property in the Groom Lake Valley. What we found from those surveys and from those demand studies is that there is a huge demand to enter onto this property, and not only that, but the people who want to enter into the property are willing to pay significant sums of money, upwards of $1,000, in order to spend the day out on the property. We then asked our appraisers to do their own finance feasibility analysis, and they came up with the same conclusion. Then we asked an economist here in the state of Nevada, who’s also a real estate expert, to do the same analysis, and they all came up with the same conclusion, that this property is unique, that there’s a high demand to go onto the property, that people would pay a significant sum of money to enter onto the property, and because of that, the property has a very high value.” On the other hand, its seems that the USAF sees Groom Mine in a far less valuable light: A largely inaccessible place in the middle of nowhere, with no active business operations, and their valuation of $333,300 seems to support such a position. Regardless of the tourism potential of the property, Groom Mine was both accessible and functioning before the federal government moved into the area. Having a neighbor that tests nuclear weapons just a handful of miles away and builds a top-secret flight testing installation in plain sight of your backdoor are not exactly the good kind to have, and they certainly do not increase your property’s value, at least not in the traditional sense—especially considering the possibility that this same neighbor may have blown-up the heart of your mining operation. Groom Mine lies just six miles from the tip of Area 51’s operational runway (the shorter one on the right)., Tyler Rogoway It’s clear why the Air Force wants the Sheahans gone. The closest publicly accessible view of the base is from Tikaboo Peak, some 26 miles away from the base. It’s not an easy hike getting there, and you’ll need a telescope to see any details of the installation. For years people have hiked Tickaboo for a peak at the un-peakable, all the while the Sheahans have been right there, just a few miles from Area 51’s runway edge. As such, whenever the family is using the property it’s likely secret aircraft and technologies cannot be tested. These delays amount to many millions of dollars added to program and facility costs every year—and it’s not like the Sheahans are not aware of this reality—they think this should factor into the value of their property. Joe Sheahan describes the situation: “According to their own filings, when they filed to take the property, Colonel Dempsey  (commander of the Nevada Test and Training Range) stated that they were losing tens of thousands, up to a million dollars an hour when we were there. We took those numbers to one of our experts, and they concluded that the government stands to gain from $444 million to $2 billion by removing us from our property because they had to shut down… The funny part about that is that if you read back, Jennifer Miller, she’s Undersecretary of Air Force for Installations, made a statement, it’s in I think the AP , that the taking of this property cannot result in a windfall for the family. Yet she’s gonna get a $2 billion windfall, and now our property’s worth $333,300. That’s a bum there.” While each side is digging in legally, the question becomes what case law exists that can be applied to such a strange land dispute. Attorney Leavitt is confident his legal team have identified prior case law that they think applies: “The federal law is very clear that the Area 51 facility is a project separate from the federal project for which the property is being taken as of September 10, 2015. I’ll give you just an example. In fact, this is a case in point. The federal government took some property and built a post office. Some years later, the federal government also wanted to purchase the adjoining property. The adjoining property, because of the construction of the post office, had increased in value in the meantime. The federal government tried to argue that the landowner should not benefit from the added value due to the construction of the post office, but the federal court said, “wait a minute, you can’t do that.” If there’s a federal project or any type of construction which was built, which was separate and apart from the project for which the property is currently being taken, that property must be valued based upon its enhanced value as a result of those prior federal projects.” Leavitt continues, “You can see the purpose behind that rule. You can come to Las Vegas and take any parcel of property here, and you could say, “Well, wait a minute, there’s freeways in Las Vegas. There’s other infrastructure in Las Vegas that the government built, so you shouldn’t be able to benefit from those other facilities that were built. Taken to its logical extent, that’s what the rule could result in. That’s why the courts are quick to identify the project for which the property is being taken. It’s called the Project Influence Rule . Once the project for which the property is being taken is identified, then you cannot consider any enhancement or depreciation to the property as a result of the project.” The attorney concludes, “Now clearly in 2015, the project for which the property is being taken is not Area 51, because Area 51 was built in the ’50s, so it cannot be the project for which the property is being taken. Now, we don’t doubt that the federal government will try and argue somehow that Area 51 is the project. I can tell you right now that’s an uphill battle, and the unanimous federal law is that the federal government will be wrong on that issue.” An intriguing image showing the main camp era from the viewpoint of a USAF aircraft. You can see the small bush plane tied down in the upper left of the frame. It is amazing to think that even in 1975, when the photo was taken, the family was able to fly into the location. Today “The Box” of airspace around Area 51, which Groom Mine sits well under, is the most restricted airspace in the United States and possibly even the world. Even US military and allied aircraft cannot breach its boundaries without significant repercussions, that is unless they are operating out of the base itself or receive unique specific and seemingly very rare clearance., Sheahan Family Joe and his family still hope that a jury trial can decide the case once and for all—and there’s the issue of getting all their personal property on the hill overlooking Area 51 moved: “The only things that have to be decided now is for a jury to decide this case as far a just compensation, and then the only other thing that we need to work out is getting 130 years worth of personal property off the property. Those are really the two things.” To the question of whether the Air Force is going to let the family on the property to remove their belongings, it seems that by law they have to—yet, some things just can’t be as easily moved—including family members buried on the grounds. “I don’t know. They sent us a letter and tried to bully us at first, and they’ve since backed off that letter,” Joe said about getting access to remove 130 years of family history from the land. “Are they obligated to? Absolutely. And we are gonna stick to that. We’re gonna stick to the law. We’re gonna follow the advice of our legal team. That’s our goal is to get our personal property back.” Groom Mine is littered with historic relics like this antique gas pump. , Sheahan Family In the end the family’s experience with the people that work in association with the shadowy base remains complicated to describe. Joe sums up his feelings about how he and his family have been treated, and by who, during this whole ordeal: “You know the funny thing is we’re not anti-government. We’re not anti-rule of law, but unfortunately, when I dealt with the people out there, I will tell you this, 95% of the people that I’ve ever dealt with related to that facility they’ve been America’s finest, and they are. They did really nice things for us, a lot of them did. I got hurt out there one time, and they took great care of me. They gave the kids ice cream. All that’s true, but unfortunately it’s overshadowed by the 5%. Those are the people that believe that they’re so important that the Constitution and your rights don’t matter. They can do anything they want, and they overshadowed those people. It’s sad. That shouldn’t happen in this country.” The War Zone contacted both the Air Force and the Department of Justice for comment on the case but all requests were declined.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 17, 2019",Optionally Manned Firebird Rapidly Matures Ahead Of International Debut This Summer,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently had the pleasure of chatting with Brian Chappel, the head of Autonomous Systems over at Northrop Grumman, about a program we have followed closely since before it was even officially disclosed—the Firebird optionally manned medium altitude, long endurance (MALE) surveillance aircraft. Firebird has a real shot at revolutionizing how some aerial surveillance is done and who has access to such capabilities. Now, as Firebird wades into the back half of its flight test program, we got an update as to how the unique aircraft is progressing and what’s next for the ambitious program overall. First off, make sure to read our in-depth exposé on Firebird from December 2018 to get up to speed on its fascinating lineage and how it intends to upturn the aerial surveillance marketplace. Fast forward nearly five months and there are now three Firebird aircraft undergoing testing. Combined, they have amassed hundreds of hours of flight time not just in the manned configuration, but also in the unmanned configuration. The ability to rapidly transition the plane from manned to unmanned mode is at the heart of the Firebird concept. It can fly beyond line-of-sight, very long duration missions via a satellite data-link that gets installed where the cockpit is otherwise situated in just a matter of a couple of hours. With the flight test program approaching its conclusion, Chappel and the Firebird team are looking outward to expand the aircraft’s horizons, both in terms of business capture and mission sets. Firebird is sure to be a crowd favorite when it flies to the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) in the United Kingdom this summer. This will be the first major aerospace exhibition for Firebird and it will allow for direct exchanges with potential customers about the plane’s immense flexibility and what that means for their unique needs and goals. Chappel described the thinking behind Firebird’s presence at RIAT to us as such: “This summer we will take one of the aircraft to RIAT… You might ask why we aren’t going to Paris? That’s an awfully big show and we find that at RIAT we can have a much more intimate experience. That connects with another aspect of what’s new. There’s a lot of international interest. We will be highlighting Firebird and giving some walkarounds and in-depth discussions with potential international customers at RIAT in a way that sometimes is kind of difficult in Paris.” Firebird can be offered to customers in multiple forms. Buying the plane outright is remarkably inexpensive considering it is a purpose built, long-endurance surveillance platform that has an optionally manned capability baked-in. Chappel noted that the aircraft itself will sell for “well under” $10M apiece. The number goes up when you add the unmanned option and different sensor packages. The plane can fly with as many as five sensor systems installed on it at one time and that number could grow in the future. Roughly two dozen payloads have already been flown during tests. Firebird has a huge payload bay as well as three hardpoints to mount pretty much anything one can imagine. And this is the other primary goal of the Firebird team going forward, to bring in as many new sub-systems to be paired with the airframe as possible. Firebird in unmanned mode. , Northrop Grumman The aircraft’s avionics and mission systems are entirely open architecture and were designed to make integrating new payloads, and the software needed to operate them, as cheap and fast as possible. This is a big selling point for foreign buyers as they can integrate their own sensor systems onto Firebird and may be able to sell those sensors to other users of the aircraft. In fact, when it comes to offsets, Brian Chappel made it clear that there is nothing especially challenging when it comes to building Firebird’s airframe—it uses simple manufacturing processes. So, local production is indeed a possibility for foreign customers that also see the plane’s unique potential. Chappel describes this strategy in depth: “I would say that none of the technology is exquisite, but the integration and how it all comes together to create such a broad set of capabilities is exquisite. And that’s what enables you to do all of it at less than exquisite pricing… The manufacturing approach is very similar in that regard. It does not require extensive or exquisite tooling or expertise and one of the approaches we are finding that is getting traction internationally is the ability to stand up alternate production sites. It is really inexpensive to be able to do that. To the extent that other parties or governments are interested in the capability, but also want to begin developing a capability to produce this type or class of aircraft, we’re fine with doing that. We are absolutely looking at and examining a regional manufacturing approach to be able to do that.” Although Northrop Grumman is still somewhat cryptic as to who is already signed on to buy Firebird airframes, they can say that it has already been sold to the U.S. Government and multiple aircraft are being built for undisclosed units that will put the plane to work. We don’t know for sure if this the U.S. military alone, or if federal agencies are also involved, but a mix of both is certainly possible. Frankly, everyone from the Department of State Air Wing to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol could make great use of Firebird. One of the coolest things about Firebird is that it can self-deploy anywhere in the world with a pilot at its controls and even work out of small, rough airfields. Once forward deployed, it can then be converted into unmanned configuration and fly missions lasting over 30 hours. It single six-cylinder Lycoming TEO-540 engine runs on avgas and can be supported pretty much anywhere in the world. It’s also far less expensive to operate and overhaul than a turbine engine. All this means that Firebird can deploy with a tiny footprint pretty much anywhere it needs to be and work very efficiently once there. Being able to tailor payloads to the operating environment and mission is one thing, but being able to literally tailor the aircraft’s operational concept is entirely something else altogether. Some operations and operating areas benefit from or even necessitate a human in the cockpit, while others largely benefit from long-duration missions run from a ground station. Being able to provide both in one airframe is revolutionary, at least in terms of a purpose-built aircraft being sold and sustained by an American aerospace-defense prime contractor. Chappel describes Firebird’s unique flexibility: “You’re manned with zero, one, or two pilots, depending upon your mission. Particularly in Australia, the way I highlighted it was it’s a big continent, lots of ocean all around it. Interesting missions to do in just about any direction you can point. You might be doing maritime surveillance or counter-illegal fishing or people smuggling operations up in the north or northwest approaches to Australia, you would be doing that unmanned, you want that long patrol capability. But then some emergency in the interior or the outback occurs—they had some pretty significant flooding not too long ago, and of course, they have a history of terrible wildfires—you come back from a mission and reconfigure very quickly to your manned configuration. If you have the need to land somewhere in an austere environment to let a doctor off or let an agent out, you have the ability to do that, and just a few hours ago you were flying unmanned long-duration over the ocean.” Also, customers can buy the aircraft in its basic configuration and slowly add more capabilities as they see fit. Its standard manned format and its basic sensor load can be upgraded later on with an unmanned configuration option and more diverse and advanced sensor systems. Firebird in manned configuration. It can be flow by one or two pilots and uses open architecture Garmin 3000 avionics. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com In addition, Chappel told us that for users that need the Firebird somewhere around the globe quick, it can be easily broken down and flown on a transport. Its modular carbon fiber design made this nearly a default capability. Northrop Grumman has paired with Tenax Aerospace to offer Firebird to potential customers that may not be able to afford the whole aircraft up front, or who just want to see how it fits their needs without spending millions of dollars. Providing such a powerful information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability ‘by the glass’ instead of ‘by the bottle’ should allow MALE capability to migrate to a customer base that never was able to access it before. In the end, this means more Firebirds flying around the globe and it could be a great gateway to selling airframes to customers that can actually experience the value proposition that the aircraft provides before plunking down the funds to buy their own planes and payloads. By offering a non-purchase option, governments can buy Firebird time and spread it across multiple agencies instead of just one. Once again, this can make customers out of entities that never really realized they had a need for this type of aircraft and its diverse payload ecosystem before. Building out that ecosystem with the maximum variety of sensors and systems that can plug and play on Firebird is a major goal of the program. Electro-optical and infrared sensors, radars, electronic surveillance systems, communications intelligence gathering systems, and other traditional payloads are key to the program. Yet other applications exist, as well, such as communications relay payloads and those that are specifically tuned for missions like geological surveying, marine wildlife tracking, disaster response, forest fire mapping, atmospheric sampling , and other environmental monitoring needs. These are all areas where Firebird could really soar. So, bringing new payload partners into the Firebird program will only provide more solutions to a broader customers base. As for the possibility of putting air-to-ground weaponry on an aircraft that can fly for 30 plus hours over the battlefield and is loaded with powerful sensors, Chappel said it is still a possibility, but no work is being done on it at this time. The aircraft is primarily seen as a surveillance platform, so that really isn’t surprising, but with guided munitions becoming ever smaller and more easily integrated onto diverse airframes , one can only imagine that Firebird could be one heck of a persistent air-to-ground platform, at least as a secondary duty to its surveillance role. Firebird landing at Montgomery Field in San Diego. , Northrop Grumman As for how big the market may be for Firebird, Chappel made it clear that they are starting out small in hopes of building a big foundation for future success. He sees demand for dozens of Firebirds in the near term, with potentially several hundreds as the program advances and as potential customers, some of which may have discreet manned and unmanned aircraft doing similar missions today, see just how economical and flexible Firebird can be. One hurdle to Firebird’s export success could be the limitations the U.S. government has historically put on exporting higher-end unmanned technologies. But this is changing and Chappel doesn’t see it being a major issue going forward: “From an export policy standpoint, people will focus on the unmanned part of it, and of course we have to work through the policy and MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] types of issues, but the environment on that is very, very encouraging. We are getting a lot of encouragement, not just for Firebird, but for a number of our systems and doing it in a thoughtful way with U.S. Government to make sure that good decisions are made, but opportunities are able to be pursued. That wasn’t always the case if you go back a few years, but that environment has shifted and is really giving us great encouragement about opportunities for systems like Firebird internationally.” Northrop Grumman Although it isn’t the most glamorous aircraft program underway today, I believe Firebird is one of the most pivotal. If Northrop Grumman and their partners deliver a MALE optionally manned capability for the dollar figures they are proposing and with the degree of flexibility and adaptability that the plane was designed for, it could heavily impact the manned and unmanned ISR platform marketplace in ways that aren’t even predictable at this time. All told, Firebird can be something different to each of its customers, and that means there should be a very big tent, or should I say hangar, full of potential users that could leverage its unique capabilities. We will continue to keep you posted as Firebird marches towards its grand arrival on the world stage at RIAT this summer.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2019",USAF Wants To Turn HC-130J’s Self Defense Suite Into “Sauron’s Eye” Vision System,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force wants to leverage the cameras in the directional infrared countermeasures system on the HC-130J Combat King II rescue aircraft and turn them into an augmented vision system , similar in general concept to the Distributed Aperture System on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, to give the crew better situational awareness. The service has nicknamed the project Sauron’s Eye, a reference to chief villain Sauron’s all-seeing magical eye in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the results could easily find their way onto any other aircraft with the similar self-protection systems installed. On Apr. 30, 2019 , the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) first issued a request for contractors to send in white papers detailing their proposals for how to modify Northrop Grumman’s Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system on the HC-130J to meet these requirements. The Combat King II first entered service in 2013 and LAIRCM is standard equipment for the plane during combat search and rescue operations. “The HC-130J aircraft configuration, as it stands today, physically limits crew scanning capabilities to the paratroop door windows and the front windows of the aircraft,” the contracting notice, which AFMC posted on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps, explained. “To meet current mission requirements, additional SA [situational awareness] devices are required to provide HC-130J crew members significantly enhanced capabilities to scan for factor threats around the aircraft as well as to assist with personnel recovery.” LAIRCM already offers the basic building blocks of an augmented vision system. Designed to counter short-range heat-seeking surface to air missiles, it employs a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) consisting of five infrared video cameras positioned around the plane to spot those incoming threats. That system then cues a turreted laser, which shines into the missile’s seeker, blinding and confusing it, and throwing it off course. An HC-130J Combat King. One of the plane’s LAIRCM sensors is visible right above and to the right of the main landing gear. One of the laser turrets is visible on the side of the very rear of the fuselage., USAF “The current LAIRCM system has five sensors installed on the aircraft which are capable of providing infrared (IR) video display in overlapping 360° views around the aircraft,” the Sauron’s Eye request for white papers noted. “However, it lacks the ability to ‘stitch’ them together.” What this means is that the crew can only look at the field of view of each individual camera independently. Purpose-built distributed aperture systems, such as the AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS) on the F-35, which you can read about in more detail here , feature a central processing component that combines these images, or “stitches them together,” into a single pannable feed. A diagram showing the components in one particular configuration of Northrop Grumman’s Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) system. This configuration includes six infrared sensors, while the one for the HC-130J only has five. , DOD In the case of the Joint Strike Fighter, this feed is then projected straight onto the visor of the pilot’s helmet, allowing them to “see” in any direction they look, even “through” the fuselage. In April 2019, Lockheed Martin announced that they had successfully tested a new modular Pilotage Distributed Aperture Sensor (PDAS) system, which you can learn more about in depth here , that functions in much the same way on Bell V-280 Valor tilt rotor. You can see what the view looks like from PDAS in the video below. One of the requirements for Sauron’s Eye is to combine whatever processing system might transform the LAIRCM into an augmented vision system with either a virtual reality or augmented reality capability. Possible options for meeting this requirement could include a dedicated virtual reality helmet, a system that sends the video feed to some kind of helmet-mounted display, or a hybrid system that displays the feed on a flat screen, but is viewed in stereoscopic 3D for a more immersive picture. The latter option, which boom operators employ on the Air Force’s new Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tankers, might offer too much of a limited field of view. It would also prevent the user from immediately understanding the true direction of the threat or object of interest. A helmet-mounted system would ensure that the user is always looking straight at the threat or object of interest, making it just that much easier to communicate that information to other members of the crew. The potential benefits of adding any sort of augmented vision system onto the HC-130J are obvious. Among its multiple roles, the Combat King II acts as an aerial tanker for combat search and rescue helicopters, which require both aircraft to remain in a relatively fixed position, increasing their vulnerability. Refueling operations also just bring the aircraft into close proximity with other aircraft, which presents its own risks . As noted, the HC-130J’s existing configuration offers limited options for visually monitoring for any potential threats or for monitoring the relative position of the plane in relation to other aircraft or helicopters. An HC-130J refuels two HH-60G Pave Hawk rescue helicopters., USAF Visual scanning itself is of limited utility, especially at night, when observers would have to rely mostly on seeing the plume of a missile’s rocket motor or tracers from an anti-aircraft gun. The Combat King II does have a sensor turret under the nose with electro-optical and infrared cameras, but this offers only a relatively narrow field of view and could only ever focus on one particular direction at a time. The crew also uses night vision goggles for missions after dark, but these generally have more limited fidelity and don’t offer a way to “see” through the plane. “Identifying Air Defense Artillery (ADA) engagements even against threats not using tracers would be possible utilizing the IR spectrum. Surface-to-air missiles and maneuverable-portable air defense systems (SAM/MANPADS) engagements from beyond unassisted visual range, and/or from aft of the aircraft could be identified and reacted to, increasing aircraft survivability,” the Sauron’s Eye notice said. “Additionally, this system would reduce crew workload by allowing both visual and electronic scanning to be accomplished simultaneously, thereby reducing the number of aircrew visual scanners required to be posted in windows.” Airmen sit on the rear loading ramp of an HC-130J Combat King II in flight., USAF For combat search and rescue operations, Sauron’s Eye could have benefits well beyond scanning for potential threats and “assist with personnel recovery,” as the Air Force’s contracting notice said. Depending on the capabilities of the MAWS’ cameras, it could make it easier to spot things such as a downed aircraft, emergency flares, or infrared beacons, that could help point to the specific location of friendly personnel in need on the ground. During combat search and rescue operations, an HC-130J also could find itself needing to land in an austere environment using an improvised runway . Smoke, dust, or other obscurants could make it difficult to safely maneuver and touch down, particularly after the sun goes down, increasing the risk to the crew and potentially forcing them to abort the mission. Sauron’s Eye would provide valuable additional situational awareness and another means of monitoring the aircraft in relation to potential hazards during those dangerous operations. An HC-130J lands on a dirt runway during a training exercise., USAF The Air Force wants whatever system can turn the LAIRCM into an augmented vision system to be a roll-on/roll-off arrangement that two airmen can load onto an HC-130J and have set up and ready to go in an hour or less. There’s no fixed timeline yet for when the service might hope to field this add-on system. But if the final system is so simple that two airmen can install it in a cargo plane within an hour, it could be readily portable to other fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft equipped with the LAIRCM. Even if the specific configuration for the HC-130J doesn’t necessarily translate to other aircraft, the core technology could be applicable for future versions that meet the space, power generation, and other constraints of different platforms using directional infrared countermeasures systems. The War Zone has already laid out the vast potential benefits of adding distributed aperture systems, in general, for both military and commercial aircraft here . Leveraging an existing system, such as LAIRCM, would only make it easier to add these game-changing features to more platforms and do so with less costly design and modification work. The Air Force isn’t the only U.S. military service to use directional infrared countermeasures , and many American allies also have these systems installed on various fixed and rotary wing aircraft, which could only further help generate interest in Sauron’s Eye well beyond the combat search and rescue community. Different LAIRCM versions alone are options for all current U.S. military C-130 variants, including special operations MC-130 and AC-130 types , as well as a host of other platforms. This includes, but isn’t limited to, Air Force C-17 transport planes , Air Force and Marine Corps V-22 Ospreys , Marine CH-53 transport helicopters , and Army AH-64 gunships and CH-47F transport helicopters . Variants of this self-defense suite are also prominent features on U.S. military VIP transport aircraft, including the Air Force’s two VC-25A Air Force One planes, and helicopters, such as the Marine’s VH-3Ds and VH-60s . Air Force KC-135 tankers are set to begin getting this self-defense system in the near future and they’ll be a feature on the Marine Corps’ future VH-92A presidential helicopters . If Sauron’s Eye, or a similar system, can work with other MAWS components, that would only open up even more possibilities, including on certain fighter jets, such as the F-15X Advanced Eagle . A US Army CH-47F Chinook helicopter with a directional infrared countermeasures system installed., USAF For the C-130 family as a whole, the added situational awareness and ability to better spot threats will be a boon for the aging design. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), in particular, has been investigating a host of possible options to improve the survivability of its MC-130s in recent years, which you can read about in detail here , in the face of ever improving potential threats. Sauron’s Eye could be one component of a broader upgrade program to ensure the special operations transports remain relevant in higher-end conflicts in the near future. Depending on the exact nature of the processor that stitches together the LAIRCM camera feeds, Sauron’s Eye could leave a door open for the addition of new functionality in the future, as well. Lockheed Martin has already said that their PDAS system has an open architecture design to make it easier to add in additional sensor fusion capabilities and other features down the road. Using an artificial intelligence-enable software package, Sauron’s Eye could potentially alert users to non-missile threats or other items of interest it detects. The MAWS is already set up to automatically detect a certain category of threats—infrared-guided missiles—and then cue one of the LAIRCM’s laser turrets to engage it. It could potentially perform a similar operation for non-missile anomalies, but with the plane’s main sensor turret to allow for closer inspection of a particular area of interest. At the very least, it could provide an indication to users of where to look in real-time. All told Sauron’s Eye would certainly give important and impressive new capabilities to the HC-130J, but it seems the Air Force is laying out a path to quickly adding an “all-seeing” vision system onto a much broader array of aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. At around 6pm, near Tellico Plains and the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee, roughly 50 miles southwest of Knoxville, a T-45C Goshawk trainer belonging to Navy Training Squadron Seven (VT-7) “Eagles” crashed. Both the instructor and student onboard died in the mishap. The jet was based out of NAS Meridian, located in Mississippi. The Snowbird Military Operating Area is in the vicinity of the crash site and a number of military low-level training routes wind their way through the nearby mountains. It isn’t clear exactly what the flight profile of the Goshawk was at the time of crash. The debris field where the jet impacted the ground is said to be somewhere around a mile long. The squadron has executed an operational pause following the loss of their squadron mates and it’s not clear exactly when they will begin flight operations once again. The terrible news comes just over a month after the Navy’s T-45 community had the heavy flight restrictions placed on it, which included not being able to fly over 5,000 feet, largely removed. They were put in place as the result of a spate of reports from pilots describing physiological events in the cockpit, namely the sudden inability to breathe clean oxygen and resulting cases of hypoxia like symptoms. Similar problems have been experienced in F/A-18 Hornets and the USAF’s F-35A Joint Strike Fighters . Both services have struggled with finding the exact cause of the potentially deadly issues. The area where the T-45 went down. Tellico Plains is in the lower left quadrant. , VFR Sectional The grounding lasted from April to August when the jets were finally allowed to fly over a much wider range of their flight envelopes, allowing student pilots to start their flying syllabi once again. The tight flight restrictions meant that instructors were mainly the ones allowed to fly the Goshawks over the last five months, and that was just to keep up some form of currency in the jet. As part of getting back into the air for training, a digital oxygen monitoring and alert system known as the CRU-123 is being fitted to T-45s. As of the middle of September, 111 of 170 T-45s in the force had been equipped with the new system. Not only does it provide a measurement of oxygen being supplied to a pilot, but it can also record all the environmental data it collects so that it can be downloaded after each sortie. This information can be especially useful in better diagnosing the T-45’s chronic environmental issues over time. A water separation system that is present on many other tactical jet onboard oxygen generation systems (OBOGS) is also going to be installed on the T-45 as a preventive measure. Flightglobal.com wrote in June: “The navy’s review team discovered T-45’s OBOGS does not have a water separator mechanism, even though the service fields a similar mechanism on OBOGS in high performance jets, Moran says. When water interacts with contaminants in the OBOGS, it can release the contaminants into the aircrew breathing air. The navy will install water separators on T-45s by this fall.. In parallel with ongoing mitigation efforts, industry will install breathing air pressure warning for aircraft fitted with the solid state oxygen monitor (CRU-123) this month and develop a next-generation OBOGS known as GGU-25.” The T-45 is the only carrier capable trainer in the Pentagon’s inventory. , USN But still, as of a couple weeks ago four separate physiological events were reported by T-45 pilots during which the oxygen monitoring equipment all read normal levels, which puts the cause of this deadly crash into even greater question. The T-45C is absolutely critical to the Navy’s production of fleet pilots. It remains the only jet trainer in the inventory that can operate from an aircraft carrier.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military insists that it is not actively preparing for an intervention into Venezuela, but the rhetoric is escalating from Trump Administration officials and politicians who continue to demand that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro step down and allow opposition leader Juan Guaido to form a new government. This has included a number of veiled threats and a bizarre and entirely unfounded allegation that Russia has deployed nuclear weapons to the Latin American country. All of this comes as Guaido’s supporters continue to skirmish with security forces loyal to Maduro in Venezuela’s capital Caracas for a second straight day. The latest phase of Venezuela’s protracted economic and political crisis began on Apr. 30, 2019 , when Guaido announced the beginning of Operacion Libertad , or Operation Liberty, which began with a call for a massive popular uprising against Maduro and an appeal for members of the country’s security forces to join the movement. By the end of the day, however, another senior opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez , had fled with his family to the Chilean Embassy and a number of defecting soldiers had reportedly sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. You can read The War Zone ‘s detailed coverage of these events here .Â Maduro and Guaido have been in a standoff since January 2019 when the opposition leader declared himself Interim President and promptly received official recognition as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state from the United States and dozens of other countries. The Trump Administration has, without caveat, offered its full support to Guaido. “The president [Trump] has been crystal clear and incredibly consistent,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Fox Business Network on May 1, 2019. “Military action is possible, if that’s what’s required â€“ that’s what the United States will do.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in the black shirt, walks with Colombian President Ivan Duque during a visit to that country in April 2019 that focused in large part on the crisis in neighboring Venezuela., Rafael Hernandez/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images Venezuela was a hot topic for members of Congress at separate hearings with U.S. military officials on Capitol Hill on May 1, 2019, as well. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford fielded questions from the House Appropriations Committee’s subcommittee on defense matters, while U.S. Navy Admiral Craig Faller, head of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), responded to queries from House Armed Services Committee. “The president [Trump] has made it clear that all options are on the table,” Dunford said. “The situation is a little bit unclear today from our perspective between Maduro and Guaido â€“ Guaido being the legitimate member of the government. Weâ€™re doing what we can now to collect intelligence to make sure we have good visibility on whatâ€™s happening down in Venezuela and be prepared to support the president should he require more from the U.S. military.” Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, at center, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, at left, testify before Congress on May 1, 2019., AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan acknowledged that the U.S. military had been engaged in contingency planning regarding Venezuela, but described this as routine. He also said the United States has been engaged with Venezuela’s neighbors Colombia and Brazil, both important U.S. allies in the region, about possible paths forward. â€œOur leadershipâ€™s been clear, it has to be â€¦ a democratic transition,â€ Faller said in his own hearing. â€œWe are in total support of diplomacy and we stand ready to support that effort.â€ Faller otherwise echoed many of the same remarks that Shanahan and Dunford had made, stressing that the U.S. position was to pursue diplomatic options first and foremost. He did note specifically that there had been planning done regarding a potential evacuation operation to extract American nationals from Venezuela, if necessary. In March 2019 , the U.S. government did withdraw all of its diplomatic staff from Venezuela, as well as other personnel. US Navy Admiral Craig Faller, head of US Southern Command., SOUTHCOM To be sure, the U.S. military does routinely develop contingency plans about how it might respond to crises around the world and updates them in periods of more pronounced upheaval. But the continued declaration that “all options remain on the table” is also common truism from the U.S. government that does not automatically point to any preferred course of action or outcome. At the same time, there have certainly been comments from U.S. officials and politicians, as well as specific actions, that have all the hallmarks of individuals looking to build a case for an intervention and clear the way for the U.S. military to proceed in prosecuting one. Trump himself has publicly and privately pushed for a military operation to overthrow Maduro on multiple occasions in the past already. You can read more about the military forces the U.S. military has arrayed in the region that it might call upon for such an operation here and here . On May 1, 2019, a spokesperson for Shanahan announced that the Acting Secretary of Defense would be canceling a visit to Europe in part to more closely coordinate with the National Security Council (NSC) and the State Department regarding the situation in Venezuela. Shanahan would have remained reachable at all times during his trip, suggesting there is a specific desire to have him available to be physically in the room with his NSC and State Department counterparts, as well as U.S. military commanders, if necessary. Following the eruption of clashes between Guaido’s supporters and Maduro loyalists, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had told U.S. commercial carriers to avoid transiting through Venezuelan airspace at altitudes below 26,000 feet and to cease all operations within the country within 48 hours. The altitude prohibition would ensure that the planes remain out of the range of short-range, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.Â The US FAA has issued a prohibition on US carriers operating in Venezuelan territory/airspace below 26,000 feet and has given any US operators in Venezuela 48 hrs to depart via the â€˜most expeditious possible routeâ€™. ğŸ—ºğŸ‡»ğŸ‡ª https://t.co/6nQQqAT3Eq pic.twitter.com/4IXHi8U2L8 — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) May 1, 2019 The Venezuelan military has significant numbers of these weapons and there have been concerns that if the crisis in the country deepens these could find their way onto the black market. There is also a risk that Maduro could order these missiles issued to irregular forces with questionable training and discipline. The general quality of the country’s regular military and other security forces is also a matter of debate. “Weâ€™ve got the Cubans there [in Venezuela], the Russians, the Chinese. Many dimensions â€¦ this is not a timetable we control,” Shanahan had told legislators at the hearing. “To the degree we can respond, alter our tactics and take advantage of the situation, we will.” The Acting Secretary of Defense was referring to the presence of Russian uniformed military personnel in Venezuela, who arrived in late March 2019 , ostensibly to help their Venezuela counterparts refurbish and maintain various critical weapon systems, including a small number of S-300VM long-range surface-to-air missile systems. In January 2019 , there were reports that Kremlin-linked mercenaries had also touched down in Caracas specifically to guard Maduro himself. #Venezuela : Erected #S300 (VM) #launcher and additional activity of the battery were detected (7 April 2019) in the #operational deployment areas of CapitÃ¡n Manuel Rios #airbase . #ISI #Intelligence #IMINT #VISINT pic.twitter.com/hK5MOPd9OB — ImageSat Intl. (@ImageSatIntl) April 10, 2019 On Apr. 30, 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo had gone so far as to claim that the Kremlin had been instrumental in convincing Maduro to remain in the country rather than flee to Cuba during an interview with CNN ‘s Wolf Blitzer. America’s top diplomat also listed off a number of senior Venezuelan officials who had been prepared to support Guaido, but then backed out of joining Operation Liberty. This was clearly meant to give weight to the opposition leader’s movement, but the lack of actual support seemed to more strongly suggest that the Venezuelan strongman’s position was never seriously in doubt. Still, “fire up the plane,” Pompeo declared when Blizter prompted him to address Maduro directly. Big news – Secretary Pompeo tells @wolfblitzer Maduro had his plane ready on tarmac, planning to head to Havana, when Russia convinced him to stay.

The month before, the Kremlin had sent a pair of Tu-160 strategic bombers and supporting personnel to Venezuela for a series of joint training exercises , drawing the ire of American officials.Â Russian Tu-160s fly with a Venezuelan F-16 Viper fighter jet during a training exercise in December 2018., Russian MoD There were also unconfirmed reports that the Venezuelan government had offered the Kremlin the right to establish a more permanent bomber base on a small island off the coast. These stories offer the only reasonable explanation for a bizarre claim that Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, made on Fox News ‘ Tucker Carlson Tonight on Apr. 30, 2019 . â€œAre you saying the Russians will put nuclear missiles in Venezuela?â€ Carlson asked at one point. â€œWhat I am suggesting is that they are already there,â€ Diaz-Balart responded. The Tu-160 bombers are nuclear capable, but there is no evidence whatsoever that Russia had deployed nuclear weapons to Venezuela along with those aircraft. There is similarly nothing to support the claim that the Russians have nuclear-armed missiles of any kind in the Latin American country now. The goal was obviously to evoke memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis , despite the current Venezuelan crisis in no way approaching the same level of severity. There is similarly a growing set of claims regarding the extent of Cuban and Chinese military presence in Venezuela, as well as support from other regimes hostile to the United States, such as Iran , many of which lack hard evidence. For instance, Cuba is a major regional ally of Venezuela and has certainly provided a variety of aid to help prop up Maduro’s regime throughout an extended economic crisis that began in 2014. Cuba has also helped train Venezuelan military units in the past and the regime of Cuban President Raul Castro is certainly advising Maduro.Â Cuban President Raul Castro, at left, embraces Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a memorial for the late Cuban dictator and Raul’s brother, Fidel Castro, in 2016., Mikhail Voskresenskiy/Sputnik via AP The U.S. government claims there are between 20,000 and 25,000 members of Cuba’s security forces in Venezuela, but Havana insists that these are medical personnel. Venezuela’s medical infrastructure has certainly suffered in recent years and Cuban support appears to have been essential in preventing its complete collapse. Whether or not Havana has exploited the situation to deploy an armed force to more actively bolster Maduro’s regime remains unclear. China is similarly heavily invested in Maduro’s regime, especially with regards to Venezuela’s oil sector. Reports in late March that China had sent its own contingent of troops seem to have been entirely fabricated, however. These reports were based on the appearance Chinese Yangtze River Express Airlines Boeing 747 cargo plane at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas. That airplane brought in aid for the Maduro regime.Â There is absolutely no evidence of over a hundred Chinese PLA troops arriving at Margarita Island in #Venezuela on March 31, 2019.

A shootout between U.S. troops and foreign forces supporting Maduro could easily escalate the conflict beyond Venezuela’s borders. Direct U.S. support could also threaten Guaido’s credibility, playing into Maduro’s propaganda that his opponents are nothing but American agents . Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro., AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos That being said, SOUTHCOM’s Admiral Faller’s mention of an evacuation effort to get American citizens out of Venezuela is the kind of thing that could provide a pretext for a larger intervention. In 1989 , the United States invaded Panama and overthrew that country’s then-dictator Manuel Noriega. The murder of a U.S. service member by Panamian security forces and the assault of a U.S. Navy officer and his wife who witnessed the incident were essential to President George W. Bush’s decision to launch the operation. Still, various key regional allies, including Colombia, as well as a number of members of Congress, including those who adamantly support the Trump Administration, have rebuffed the President’s proposals to forcefully overthrow Maduro in the past. Notably, Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator from South Carolina who was previously a major critic of Trump before becoming a prominent acolyte of the President, advised him to “go slow” on Venezuela earlier this year. “He said, ‘Well, I’m surprised, you want to invade everybody,'” Graham recounted in January 2019 . “And I said, ‘I don’t want to invade everybody, I only want to use the military when our national security interests are threatened.'” Regardless, the U.S. government continues to declare Guaido the legitimate leader of Venezuela and call for Maduro to step down, continuing with the refrain that “all options are on the table.” Late on May 1, 2019, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan Tweeted out that “this is an issue of freedom vs. tyranny.” Whether or not the U.S. government will actually move beyond exercise its various economic and diplomatic options, while offering rhetorical and moral support to Guaido, and actually launch a military intervention remains unclear. At the very least, the Trump Administration and its own supporters certainly seem to be laying out at least the foundations of an argument for a more forceful effort to eject Maduro from power.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The situation in Venezuela remains fluid after opposition leader Juan Guaido, backed by elements of the country’s military, launched a bid to forcefully remove embattled President Nicolas Maduro from office. Venezuela has been in a state of political upheaval since January 2019 , when Guaido, President of the Country’s National Assembly, declared himself Interim President and quickly received the support of the United States, as well as many countries in Latin America and around the world. However, despite subsequent sanctions and threats , primarily from the U.S. government, Madruo has stubbornly held on to power . Early on Apr. 30, 2019, Guaido announced the beginning of what he has dubbed Operacion Libertad , or Operation Liberty. The opposition leader called for massive popular protests to finally unseat Maduro and asked the country’s security forces to abandon the dictatorial leader. Armed members of the military and police who had already joined Guaido cause have donned blue armbands and bandanas now to distinguish themselves from forces loyal to Maduro. Guaido was notably joined by Leopoldo López , another opposition who the Maduro regime has incarcerated, first in prison and then under house arrest, since he called for mass protests in 2014. Guaido claimed that military personnel keeping López under house arrest had freed him as part of Operation Liberty, but the events surrounding his release remain unconfirmed. Juan Guaido, at left, and Leopoldo López stand together outside La Carlota on Apr. 30, 2019., Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images “People of Venezuela, we need to go out on the streets together, to support the democratic forces and to regain our freedom,” a Spanish-language post on Guaido’s official Twitter account read early on Apr. 30, 2019. “People of Caracas, all to La Carlota.” Guaido was referring to La Carlota Air Base in Venezuela’s Capital Caracas, which appeared to be where the opposition leader intended to create a main base of operations. The base has figured into past political upheaval, including a coup attempt by Hugo Chavez to seize control in 1992 that included a brief air battle overhead. Chavez would become president in 1999, leading Venezuela’s government down an increasingly dictatorial path until his death in 2013, after which Maduro succeeded him. In this latest political crisis, military personnel at the base had remained loyal to Maduro, driving out civilians who at one point managed to breach a fence along the perimeter. Armed individuals loyal to Guaido subsequently set up positions with extra ammunition and bananas on a highway bridge outside the base, seeming to point to at least some preparations for a potential standoff. At around 11:00 AM, forces loyal to Maduro arrived on motorcycles to try and dislodge the fighters on the bridge, firing tear gas grenades and potentially shooting live rounds at them. This, in turn, prompted gunfire from the opposition positions, though available video footage shows them mainly firing blindly into the air. There have since been sporadic reports of gunfire, but it is unclear whether these subsequent reports simply refer to the shooting on and around the bridge outside La Carlota. There is at least one clip that does show armored vehicles belonging to Venezuela’s national police attempting to force opposition protesters to disperse and running over some of them in the process. There is also footage of security forces loyal to Maduro arresting defecting members of the country’s armed forces. Despite having apparently failing to secure La Carlota, Guadio and his supporters have since turned their attention to marching on the Miraflores Palace , Venezuela’s presidential offices, to demand Maduro step down. Forces loyal to the current regime had already blocked roads and other avenues leading to the palace and irregular militia associated with the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, commonly known as colectivos , have also turned out to oppose the procession. There are also reports of protests against Maduro in 22 of Venezuela’s 24 states. However, the actual size and scope of these demonstrations are unclear. It remains entirely unclear how Guaido’s latest push to unseat Maduro will go. The opposition leader has been regularly calling for popular protests and defections since he first declared himself Interim President more than four months ago. So far, by every indication, the bulk of the country’s security forces remain loyal to Maduro. It is also unclear why Guaido decided now was the best time to launch Operation Liberty. Unconfirmed reports from local journalists indicate that he may have intended to wait longer, but received warning that Maduro was about to have him arrested, forcing his hand. Significant elements of the military who had pledged to join the opposition reportedly backed out. This is supported by video footage the regime has released of apparent defectors now claiming they were “tricked” into supporting the Interim President by their officers. If Guaido’s present bid to officially take control of the country fails, there is a distinct possibility that it could fuel the Maduro regime’s propaganda and prompt a new, massive crackdown on members of the country’s political opposition. Maduro blames Venezuela’s preceding major economic crisis , which led to critical shortages of food and medicine, and its present political unrest on foreign powers, chiefly the United States, actively undermining the regime. Last year, Maduro also survived an assassination attempt involving explosive carrying drones, which he subsequently blamed on militants receiving support from the United States, as well as Colombia. More recently, the Venezuelan strongman blamed the U.S. government, including the Central Intelligence Agency, for widespread power outages and an apparent shipment of weapons from the United States bound for opposition members. There is no hard evidence to support any of these claims, though the U.S. government has expressed its full backing for Guaido and the Interim President appears to be receiving political and monetary support from U.S.-based sources , as well as supporters in Latin America . There is always the possibility that Guaido has obtained weapons or other support for an actual armed uprising from these sources. For instance, photos from the bridge outside La Carlota show one opposition fighter with an AR-57 carbine equipped with an expensive Trijicon SRS reflex sight. This is gun is a uniquely American design from a company also called AR57, in Kent, Washington. It combines many external features and aesthetics from the AR-15/M16 series of rifles, but fires the relatively rare 5.7x28mm cartridge, hence the name, and features a unique upper receiver that accepts the magazines from the FN P90 personal defense weapon. But it is not in service with any security forces anywhere in the world. Of course, it equally possible, if not more likely that the individual in question had obtained this weapon privately in the past, too. American-made weapons have routinely shown up on the black market in Venezuela and in the hands of both colectivos and criminal gangs. Also, in an apparent coincidence, on the same day that Guaido has launched Operation Liberty, Reuters has reported that infamous private military contractor Erik Prince has been proposing a plan to deploy 5,000-man mercenary force to support the opposition leader. Prince has been in discussions in the United States and Europe with supporters of President Trump and Venezuelans living abroad about financing the deal, according to multiple unnamed sources. The notorious businessman “has no plans to operate or implement an operation in Venezuela,” Marc Cohen, a spokesperson for Prince, told Reuters . Regardless, it is unclear if U.S. government backing, whether it now includes covert action or not, will extend publicly beyond rhetorical and moral support. For some time now, President Donald Trump had publicly and privately advocated for a military intervention to oust Maduro. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is also a major critic of the current regime in Cuba, which also supports Maduro, has also called for more force efforts to unseat Venezuela’s dictatorial president, including publicly calling for a coup. National Security Advisor John Bolton has reiterated a common refrain that “all options are on the table,” but so far there is no indication that the Trump Administration is planning a military intervention. Bolton previously notoriously appeared at a press conference in January 2019 with a notepad that read “5,000 troops to Colombia” in what some saw a veiled threat, but there was no subsequent deployment of U.S. troops to Colombia and Maduro never waivered. Depending on how long Erik Prince’s mercenary proposal has been in existence, there is a possibility that this could have actually been in reference to that plan, though the White House National Security Council refused to confirm or deny to Reuters whether it had ever met with the private military contractor about this plan. In the past two months, the U.S. government has actually taken steps to avoid potentially becoming engrossed in an actual conflict in Venezuela, including withdrawing all diplomatic staff and other personnel from the country in March 2019 . In addition, in that same time period, Russia, one of Maduro’s principal benefactors, has reportedly sent shadowy mercenaries , as well as uniformed troops , to bolster the regime and help ensure the functioning of key weapon systems, including S-300VM long-range surface-to-air missile systems. This inherently presents a risk that a U.S. military intervention on Guaido’s behalf could easily escalate into a larger confrontation with ramifications well beyond Venezuela’s borders. At the time of writing, Leopoldo López has reportedly fled to the Chilean embassy in Caracas with his family, where he joins two other opposition leaders who have been staying there for two years now to avoid politically motivated criminal charges. Brazil’s embassy has also offered asylum to defecting members of Venezuela’s military who had joined Guaido. All of this can only be seen as a major blow to Operation Liberty. Guaido has similarly few options if his push to unseat Maduro fails. If the Venezuelan strongman wasn’t looking to arrest the opposition leader before, he almost certainly will be now. If Maduro’s government levels charges at him over his armed uprising, Guaido will likely be looking at fleeing into self-imposed exile or hiding out in a friendly Embassy like López to avoid incarceration. But with so much still uncertain, The War Zone will definitely continue to keep a close eye on this still-developing situation.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still limited, but a U.S. Air Force T-6A Texan II turboprop training aircraft has crashed near Lake Waurika in Oklahoma. The service has said that both the pilot and the co-pilot appeared to have been ejected safely, but there is no confirmation yet as to their condition. The mishap occurred just before 2:00 PM local time on May 1, 2019. The plane had flown out of Sheppard Air Force Base in neighboring Texas, according to an official statement . Sheppard is located some 35 miles southwest of Lake Waurika. “Emergency crews are en route to the scene. Initial indications are that the pilot and co-pilot ejected safely,” the statement continued. “An investigation is underway. More information will be released as it becomes available.” The official notice did not say what unit the T-6A belonged to specifically. Sheppard, home to the 80th Flying Training Wing , is the Air Force’s largest training base. The Wing’s 89th and 459th Flying Training Squadrons both fly Texan IIs. There is no information yet about what may have caused the mishap, but the T-6A fleet has suffered a number of accidents in recent years. In September 2018 , another Texan II, flying from Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, crashed near a shopping mall in San Antonio. The Air Force has yet to release any final report from the investigation into that incident. This crash also comes at a time when the U.S. military’s aviation communities as a whole are struggling to improve readiness rates and have seen a surge in major, and often fatal , mishaps over the past two years or so. Also in September 2018 , a T-38 Talon jet trainer belonging to the 80th Flying Training Wing skidded off the runway at Sheppard, prompting the pilot and co-pilot aboard that aircraft to eject. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2019",USAF F-35As Flew First-Ever Combat Strikes With Radar Reflectors And Sidewinders Fitted,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The United States Air Force’s F-35A has finally executed its first kinetic combat action. Two F-35As flew from Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE on a combat mission over Iraq on April 30th, 2019. They released GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions to strike an ISIS tunnel network and weapons cache located deep in the Hamrin Mountains near Wadi Ashai, Iraq. The facility was supposedly a danger to coalition forces and could have been a key component in the revitalization of the extremist group’s fighting power. The F-35As used in the mission are part of a larger USAF contingent of the 5th generation fighters from the 388th Fighter Wing and the 419th Fighter Wing that deployed from Hill AFB in Utah to the Middle East on April 15 , 2019. The deployment is the first to the Middle East for the USAF’s F-35As. It’s also important to note that Israel has already flown combat missions with their F-35Is and the USMC has also flown a number of combat missions over the Middle East with their F-35Bs, with the first combat use of the aircraft taking place last September. Lt. Col. Yosef Morris, 4th Fighter Squadron commander and an F-35A pilot said the following in an official USAF release: “We have the ability to gather, fuse and pass so much information, that we make every friendly aircraft more survivable and lethal… The F-35A has sensors everywhere, it has advanced radar, and it is gathering and fusing all this information from the battlespace in real time… Now it has the ability to take that information and share it with other F-35s or even other fourth generation aircraft in the same package that can also see the integrated picture… That, combined with low-observable technology, allows us to really complement any combined force package and be ready to support AOR contingencies.” You can see the AIM-9X on the canted wing pylon and the radar reflectors located just before the vertical tails in this photo as a KC-10 refuels an F-35A over the Middle East on its first combat sortie. , USAF This all may be true, but in the case of this mission, and likely most those supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the F-35s are not leveraging their low-observable (stealth) capability. The aircraft are clearly seen fitted with AIM-9X air-to-air missiles on their wingtip pylons and radar reflectors bolted on atop and below their fuselages. This gives them a large radar signature, which makes sense as they are operating over areas like Iraq where low-observability isn’t an advantage as air superiority is largely assured. Since the F-35As are already flying in an unstealthy configuration, the inclusion of AIM-9Xs makes sense as why not include them? All America tactical jets usually fly with Sidewinders for self-defense even in relatively benign air combat environments like Afghanistan. The F-35 can carry a pair of AIM-120 AMRAAMs in its weapons bays along with a full internal bomb load, but those missiles don’t have the same capabilities in the within-visual-range air combat environment as the super-nimble and high-off boresight targetable AIM-9X. The practice of flying the F-35 in non-stealthy configurations could change if the F-35As venture into Syria and take on the roving ‘quarterback’ role that the F-22 Raptor provided for years over the troubled country. There is a tradeoff to doing so, though. Flying in full-on low-observable configuration could allow a peer state like Russia, which has its most advanced air defense and electronic surveillance systems deployed to the country, to collect intelligence on the aircraft’s low observable capabilities. Albeit this is less of an issue if the F-35As stay well into the eastern part of the country. F-35As flying off a KC-10’s wing during a mission over the Middle East. Note the AIM-9Xs mounted on the aircrafts’ canted wingtip pylons and the radar reflectors on their bellies. , USAF In fact, the F-35A is less capable in certain respects than an F-16 for strike missions against insurgents. It’s targeting capabilities via its Electro-Optical Targeting System mounted under its nose inside a sapphire-glass encrusted framework is based on 15-year-old technology and pales in comparison to the image fidelity and certain key modes offered by latest Sniper and Litening targeting pods carried by 4th generation fighters. The F-35’s EOTS is supposed to upgraded under the still as yet to be fully approved Block IV upgrade program that will enhance the F-35’s software and some of its key components in the coming decade. USAF As I have posited before, giving the F-35 the ability to carry a bolt-on Advanced Sniper pod would make sense in the interim for close air support and counter-insurgency duties. In the case of their first combat action, the F-35As hit pre-planned targets with JDAMs that don’t need the aircraft’s EOTS at all. We’ll have to see how the jet does in more dynamic air support missions as its deployment continues, but since it flies these missions in unstealthy form, giving it the same ability to use advanced targeting pods that 4th generation fighters use seems incredibly logical. The fact of the matter is that most of the missions the F-35 will fly will not require its low observable capabilities at all. So these types of configurations, where external stores are carried, will be more common than not as the Joint Strike Fighter fleet expands its operations abroad. Regardless, today is a big deal for the USAF and the F-35 program, one that has been in the making for decades. With any luck, we will get more details about the F-35A’s feats over the Middle East in the coming days as the force gets better situated and the mission tempo heats up.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 10, 2019",The U.S. Military Now Denies That Japan’s Missing F-35A Has Been Found,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been some confusion over whether or not Japanese or American authorities have found the main wreckage a Japan Air Self Defense Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter that crashed in the Pacific Ocean earlier this month . A senior U.S. military officer had told reporters that personnel had found the plane, only to get contradicted by multiple other U.S. military spokespersons. U.S. Air Force General Charles Brown, head of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), told reporters that the location of the stealthy fighter jet was known during a press briefing on Apr. 30, 2019, according to Nikkei Asian Review . The F-35A crashed on Apr. 9, 2019 off the coast of Japan. The exact cause of the accident remains unknown. 41-year-old Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) Major Akinori Hosomi was at the control of the plane at the time and also remains missing. “The aircraft’s been located,” Brown said, Nikkei reported . “It’s now in the recovery aspect.” However, Nikkei later updated its story to add a statement from U.S. Air Force Colonel John Hutcheson, a spokesperson for U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ), who said that this was incorrect. Hutcheson did not clarify whether General Brown had simply misspoken or had himself received inaccurate information ahead of the press briefing. US Air Force General Charles Brown, head of Pacific Air Forces, speaks at a ceremony at US Forces Japan headquarters at Yokota Air Base in Japan., USAF “The aircraft has not been located at the bottom of the sea,” Hutcheson told Nikkei . “The U.S. military is still working with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force to locate the wreckage.” Aircraft and ships searching for the downed aircraft and Major Hosomi did find debris from the crash, including a piece of the F-35’s tail, in the days following the mishap. There have been no reports yet that Japanese or American personnel, or anyone else, have recovered more significant portions of the plane. “The Japanese Self Defense Force F-35A that crashed on April 9 has not yet been located or recovered,” an unspecified Air Force spokesperson subsequently said in a statement, according to Business Insider . “Japanese officials confirmed that some debris from the aircraft was found in early April, shortly after the accident. The U.S. continues to support JSDF-led search and recovery efforts.” The search effort has moved into something of a new phase, which may be what General Brown was referring to. On Apr. 24, 2019 , the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet announced that it had dispatched a salvage team on board a chartered ship, Ultra Deep Solutions’ DSCV Van Gogh , to assist in finding the F-35A. The DSCV Van Gogh ., Ultra Deep Solutions The Naval salvage unit is bringing a commercial deep-sea submersible, additional unmanned underwater vehicles, and a TPL-25 “towed pinger locator,” with them. The ship will be able to pull the TPL-25 behind it to try and detect emergency signals coming from the wreck. We don’t know what the exact functionality or concept of operations for the F-35’s flight recorder, or “black box,” might be and what kind of emergency locator system it, or the aircraft itself, might have. After spotting a particular signal, the Van Gogh would be able to deploy the manned submersible and drones to more closely investigate any potential crash sites. A TPL-25., USN The Japan Maritime Self Defense Force’s (JMSDF) JS Chiyoda submarine rescue ship has already been part of the search and rescue efforts. It is equipped with a Deep Sea Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) and could carry additional remotely operated vehicles, all of which could help in finding the wreckage. Last week, the Kaimei , a deep-sea research vessel from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, also joined the search for the downed F-35A. It has its own deep-sea remotely operated vehicle, as well as echo-sounders and magnetometers that it can use to search for objects of interest below the waves. The JMSDF submarine rescue ship JS Chiyoda ., via Wikimedia Initially, specialized deep-sea sensors and submersibles seemed particularly necessary since the F-35A was understood to have crashed in an area where the Pacific Ocean is up to 5,000 feet deep. This is far deeper than the maximum depth for divers and beyond the crush depth for most combat submarines. However, U.S. officials have since revised the depth estimate to a much shallower 1,500 feet. This would make the search effort easier, but would also make it easier for other actors to try and recover parts of the crashed jet, which could provide them with valuable details about the Joint Strike Fighter and its capabilities. Japanese and American officials have downplayed the prospect of a foreign power, such as Russia and China, locating the crash site first and recovering sensitive parts of the Joint Strike Fighter or its onboard systems. Russia, in particular, has an extensive fleet of special mission submarines specially configured for deep-sea intelligence gathering and salvage work, including the possible ability to deploy their own deeper-diving remotely operated vehicles. “There has been a lot of wild speculation in the media about other countries racing to find the wreckage,” an unnamed U.S. military official told Stars and Stripes in an Email on Apr. 17, 2019. “To date, we’re not seeing it, but we continue to monitor.” But it seems hard to see how Japan or the United States could know for sure given that the exact location of the wreck remains unknown and valuable debris may have shifted beyond any primary crash site in the intervening weeks. Regardless, that the U.S. military, as well as their Japanese counterparts, admittedly continue to monitor the situation for possible foreign interference underscores the potential risks. The F-35 and its associated systems are highly controlled and subject to a variety of security protocols. A JASDF F-35A., JASDF Japan, where Mitsubishi Heavy Industries runs a Final Assembly and Checkout (FACO) facility that locally assembles the country’s F-35s, will soon be getting an American-run F-35 Technology Security Support Team (TSST), if one isn’t in place already, to monitor for potential breaches. The U.S. military’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) announced it was looking for contractors to perform the TSST mission in August 2018 . “The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) requires comprehensive National Industrial Security Operating Manual (NISPOM) multi-discipline security guidance and mentorship to the Japanese Ministry of Defense (JMoD), Acquisition Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA), Air Staff Office (ASO), and Japanese Industry Contractors,” according to one contracting document . “TSST efforts shall include prescribing security measures that deny unauthorized access to F-35 facilities, equipment, and resources, and protect personnel, information, and property from damage and/or loss of technology.” It is unclear whether “security measures” related to “damage and/or loss of technology” would include the development of standard operating procedures to respond to crashes and other mishaps. The TSST’s mandate certainly highlights the security sensitivities regarding the F-35 no matter what. All told, nearly a month after Japan’s F-35A crashed in the Pacific, there is still a very active search for the wreckage and it doesn’t look likely to end any time soon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 14, 2021",U.S. Army Trains To Fire Howitzers From Landing Craft For The First Time In Decades,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Virginia Army National Guard recently conducted an extremely unusual artillery exercise involving firing a 105mm M119 howitzer from on board a U.S. Army landing craft . The combination effectively provides a mobile fire support system for amphibious operations and during missions in riverine and other littoral environments. Between Apr. 24 and 25, 2019, elements of the Virginia Army National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery Regiment conducted the waterborne artillery exercise, nicknamed Operation Gator, at the U.S. Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The active duty 11th Transportation Battalion, part of the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) based at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, provided a number of Landing Craft Mechanized Mk 8s (LCM-8) for the drill. The 11th is part of what is often described as the “Army’s Navy,” an obscure, but important array of different watercraft, which you read more about in detail here and here . The units “received and carried out their fire missions from the Intracoastal Waterway running through Camp Lejeune along the Atlantic Ocean,” a statement from the Virginia National Guard public affairs office accompanying a series of photographs from the exercise explained. “It was the first waterborne artillery mission for the 111th since D-Day during World War II, nearly 75 years ago.” What was then known as the 111th Field Artillery Battalion took part in the historic Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, landing with other elements of the National Guard’s 29th Infantry Division at Omaha Beach in Normandy. The unit has undergone a series of organizational changes over the years and today 1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery is a composite unit with both 105mm M119s and 155mm M777 howitzers . Only the 105mm weapons took part in Operation Gator. Members of the Virginia Army National Guard emplace an M119 howitzer on board an LCM-8 during Operation Gator in April 2019., Virginia Army National Guard Members of the 1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery Regiment fire a 105mm M119 howitzer from an LCM-8., Virginia Army National Guard The most obvious advantages of emplacing a 105mm howitzer on an LCM-8 are mobility and a reduction in time it takes to get the gun into action. In a more normal concept of operations, the landing craft would bring a truck towing the weapon to a beach. Afterward, the gun’s crew would have to find a suitable position ashore and get the gun ready to fire. What the 111th demonstrated at Camp Lejeune is how the LCM-8 could beach itself with the gun fixed in place already and then immediately begin providing fire support. This arrangement also means that the landing craft and howitzer could more readily move to another position as friendly forces advance. That same mobility gives the combination a shoot-and-scoot capability that could improve survivability against countrerattacks, too. An LCM-8 assigned to the 11th Transportation Battalion carries an M119 howitzer and other elements of the 1st Battalion, 111th Field Artillery Regiment., Virginia Army National Guard Four LCMs in a row during Operation Gator. The other boats would have been available to carry additional ammunition and act as command and control centers to recieve incoming fire support requests., Virginia Army National Guard In addition, the LCM-8 provides a stable firing platform regardless of the terrain in the target area. Riverine and other littoral environments often consist of marshes and soft sand that are entirely insufficient to support an artillery piece. The combination of landing craft with mounted gun offers a way to provide immediate artillery support from a landing site no matter what the terrain looks like when forces go ashore. As the Virginia National Guard’s public affairs office noted, during the landings in Normandy, the Army employed a variety of landing craft-mounted artillery weapons to provide exactly this sort of support during the initial stages of the operation. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Army also made use of similar tactics in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Amphibious vehicles with large caliber guns , either in purpose-built turrets or improvised mounts, were also used for fire support during amphibious and other waterborne operations during the war and in the years that followed. But after the Korean War, the Army steadily withdrew from the amphibious warfare space, in general. During the Vietnam War, the idea of waterborne artillery came back into vogue within the Army because of South Vietnam’s extensive networks of rivers and canals and due to the difficulty in find terrain to support firebases deep within the Mekong Delta. Elements of the 9th Infantry Division , which provided the bulk of the U.S. manpower to conduct riverine operations in the Mekong region notably used landing craft with 105mm howitzers in virtually the same way the 111th did just recently at Camp Lejeune. US Army soldiers fire an M101 howitzer from a landing craft in the Mekong Delta., US Army The 9th also eventually employed unpowered artillery barges with firing positions for two 105mm howitzers, as well as living facilities and ammunition storage, to provide more protracted fire support. During mobile operations, Army troops also used airmobile platforms that helicopters could bring into an area of operations to temporarily provide a stable firing position. Toward the tail-end of the Vietnam War, the Army codified the lessons it had learned regarding riverine warfare, including the use of howitzers on landing craft. One 1971 manual even describes how utilizing an armored 155mm M109 self-propelled howitzer on a landing craft could offer greater flexibility, given the vehicle’s fully traversable turret. It’s not clear if the Army ever did this operationally in South Vietnam. Unfortunately, in the more than four decades since America’s war in Southeast Asia ended, the idea of utilizing field artillery in this way has once again slipped largely into obscurity. The statement Virginia National Guard’s public affairs office does not say why it has decided to re-explore this concept of operations now. However, Operation Gator does come at a time when the Army as a whole is once again re-evaluating its role in littoral operations with a particular eye toward the Pacific Region . A waterborne artillery capability could also be valuable in other potential littoral hotspots in the Middle East or Europe . LCM-8s, including one with an M119 howitzer, in place along a shoreline during Operation Gator., Virginia Army National Guard But the aforementioned benefits of landing craft-mounted howitzers, as well as boats carrying other weapons such as precision-guided rocket artillery systems , would be extremely valuable when conducting distributed operations where forces may find themselves fighting on small islands across a broad front in the Pacific . For similar reasons, the Marines have been investigating ways to employ artillery from amphibious ships off shore and have expressed interest in lighter, more mobile systems that its forces could rapidly airlift ashore . Another option in the future might be a containerized artillery system that is even easier to install and remove on landing craft as required. Finnish defense contractor Patria already offers just such a system containing a 120mm mortar with an automatic loading system that it has demonstrated mounted on a small landing craft. The exercise in North Carolina also underscores the unique value that Army watercraft units have to offer. In 2017, the service announced it would finally begin buying new, more capable landing craft to replace the Vietnam War-era LCM-8s. Unfortunately, earlier this year, it emerged that the Army’s top leadership might also be looking to cut funding for watercraft programs and eliminate all active during units to free up funds for other priorities. You can read more about this still-developing situation here . It remains to be seen how far the Army will go in reviving its waterborne artillery capabilities, but it could become an important part of the service’s vision for operating in the Pacific and other littoral environments, as well as an important argument for preserving the Army’s Navy.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Feb 19, 2021",White House Sinkhole Is A Reminder Of The Bunkers That Are Buried Beneath It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A sinkhole has opened up along the North Lawn of the White House and the press and social media are having a field day with it. But the earthen anomaly can serve as a reminder that there is much more to the White House than what meets the eye. For seven and a half decades, a bunker has sat deep below the East Wing of the presidential estate. And no, it is not the famed Situation Room located in the basement of the West Wing. This is an entirely different and far more secure facility , and it in recent years it was likely augmented by a much more extravagant and modern complex buried deep beneath the western side of the North Lawn adjacent to the West Wing. A labyrinth of passageways and rooms exists beneath 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the extent of which the public really doesn’t know. Much of this infrastructure was born of the atomic age when the White House was gutted and rebuilt under the Truman Administration between 1948 and 1952. This project included the establishment of the secretive secure facility we now know as the President’s Emergency Operations Center, or PEOC. The White House seen totally gutted during the Truman renovation., National Archives The facility actually dates back to World War II. At least a part of the space was originally built as a bunker for FDR, but with the Truman renovation, the bunker was expanded and drastically updated for a new era where atomic weapons and the fallout they produce posed massively greater dangers than traditional high-explosive bombs and other forms of attack. Prior to 9/11, the facility existed in a form that was far from lavish and was highly limited in regards to how many occupants it could support within its hermetically sealed vault-like interior during a crisis. Lacking the convenience of the Situation Room, but offering far greater protection, the PEOC was there for the President and Vice President, their families, and only their closest aides to survive a surprise emergency. The sparse facility is described in Garrett Graff’s marvelous book Raven Rock (read our in-depth interview with Graff here ) as having a cot-lined hallway, a 600 square foot operations and communications room, a small briefing area, and a large command room dominated by some big-screen TVs and a conference table that can seat 16 people. When in use, a specialized U.S. Army engineering unit out of Fort Belvoir sits ready to dig out its occupants if need be. In 2015, a series of photos that were taken throughout the day of Dick Cheney on 9/11 were released. They offer an incredible look at the mood and actions of the White House top staff on that day, and they are the first images released that show the PEOC. You can see more of them here . U.S Government Image U.S Government Image U.S Government Photo U.S Government Photo U.S Government Photo U.S Government Photo U.S Government Photo The Bush Administration cabinet, with the then FBI Director Mueller in the foreground, watch the President’s Oval Office address while still inside the safety of the PEOC’s vault-like walls., U.S Government Photo During and immediately following the attacks on 9/11, Dick Cheney, various members of the Bush cabinet, First Lady Laura Bush, and eventually President Bush, huddled in the sparse bunker. In Laura Bush’s memoir Spoken From The Heart , she recounts being raced down to the dungeon-like facility on that fateful day, writing: I was hustled inside and downstairs through a pair of big steel doors that closed behind me with a loud hiss, forming an airtight seal. I was now in one of the unfinished subterranean hallways underneath the White House, heading for the PEOC, the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, built for President Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. We walked along old tile floors with pipes hanging from the ceiling and all kinds of mechanical equipment… …I was ushered into the conference room adjacent to the PEOC’s nerve center. It’s a small room with a large table. National Security Advisor Condi Rice, Counselor to the President Karen Hughes, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and Dick and Lynne Cheney were already there, where they had been since the morning. Lynne, whose agents had brought her to the White House just after the first attack, came over and hugged me. Then she said quietly into my ear, “The plane that hit the Pentagon circled the White House first.” The First Lady continues to describe being rushed down to the PEOC again later that evening: We did finally climb into our own bed that night, exhausted and emotionally drained. Outside the doors of the residence, the Secret Service detail stood in their usual posts. I fell asleep, but it was a light, fitful rest, and I could feel George staring into the darkness beside me. Then I heard a man screaming as he ran, “Mr. President, Mr. President, you’ve got to get up. The White House is under attack.” We jumped up, and I grabbed a robe and stuck my feet into my slippers, but I didn’t stop to put in my contacts. George grabbed Barney; I grabbed Kitty. With Spot trailing behind, we started walking down to the PEOC. George had wanted to take the elevator, but the agents didn’t think it was safe, so we had to descend flight after flight of stairs, to the state floor, then the ground floor, and below, while I held George’s hand because I couldn’t see anything. My heart was pounding, and all I could do was count stairwell landings, trying to count off in my mind how many more floors we had to go. When we reached the PEOC, I saw the outline of a military sergeant unfolding the ancient hideaway bed and putting on some sheets. At that moment, another agent ran up to us and said, “Mr. President, it’s one of our own.” The plane was ours. What was discovered by Bush’s staff, and in particular Vice President Dick Cheney, was that the facility was alarming underprepared for dealing with a fast-moving crisis. Cheney couldn’t reach key personnel—there wasn’t even a line between the bunker and the nearby Situation Room. The TVs couldn’t video conference and provide audio from news networks at the same time. The facility didn’t even have the systems needed for the President or Vice President to address the nation. At one point, the CO2 was rising in the bunker because it was only built to handle a small number of people within its sealed environment. In the end, command and control capabilities on that historic day were notoriously lacking. Essentially, it seemed as if the President and Vice President had the option of surviving in the cocooned facility or running the country, but not both. With the specter of the 9/11 attacks looming large, the PEOC was drastically upgraded to be more capable of tying the President into their command and control network and the outside world. New communications systems and enhancements to environment systems were installed largely at the direction of the Vice President who had dealt with continuity of government planning over the vast majority of his career. It still wasn’t ideal, but the facility would at least hopefully be able to overcome some of the critical shortfalls experienced on 9/11. Then, in 2010, part of the North Lawn adjacent to the West Wing of the White House was dug up and barriers were erected around the hole to hide part of a highly secretive a $375M construction project from the prying eyes of the very nearby media. The secrecy definitely brought on its own amount of media scrutiny , with stories popping up everywhere about how Obama was building a mysterious ‘super bunker’ under the White House lawn. The largest construction project in over 60 years at the White House kicked off in 2010. The four-year, $376 million project is being supervised by the General Services Administration (GSA), which says the work is needed to upgrade underground utilities such as water and sewer lines and electrical conduits. By all indications, it went far beyond just a utility upgrade. , Kraft LLC/Corbis via Getty Images Dubbed officially an air conditioning and mechanical systems upgrade, by almost all accounts part of the project included a new, massively expanded, PEOC—one replete with the latest communications, computer systems, and environmental technologies that could allow the President and their staff to operate unimpeded for extended periods of time during a crisis. In other words, we are likely talking about a fortified, deeply buried, five-story office building—an underground emergency White House if you will—that is in itself akin to a giant SCIF , which would also make it an ideal locale for holding highly sensitive meetings. For years, steel beams and concrete disappeared into the chasm and an army of contractors worked away at what was literally a hole in the ground. But today, by looking at the area, you would have no clue what lies beneath. The North Lawn of the White House just off the West Wing ripped up during the mysterious multi-year White House construction project. It was literally right in front of where the press post up on a daily basis., Google Earth This new and improved facility could also seemingly offer the Secret Service more options when it comes to deciding where and when to move the President, Vice President, their families, and key members of their staffs, during a crisis. In the past, the decision would have to be made to move them to other continuity of government sites, like Camp David, Raven Rock, and Mount Weather, or shelter in place. With similar capabilities of those other sites now available on the White House grounds, the option of staying put is likely far more attractive for all but the direst of circumstances. Considering how fast an attack or a major crisis could occur, it is questionable if there would be enough time for Marine One to launch from its alert site at Anacostia and make it to the White House and scurry the President off to a remote and highly secure location in time. With this in mind, a new and greatly enhanced PEOC certainly would seem to be long overdue. It’s also worth noting that an armada of other military helicopters is also on alert to move other administration officials off to secure locations scattered around the region, from the northern Allegheny Mountains own to the Carolinas. It’s also worth noting that the sinkhole seems to exist along the perimeter of where the new construction took place in 2010-2012. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the two are directly related. Washington DC was fittingly built on a swamp remember and it has been a particularly wet stretch for the Capital. But it’s funny that such a small thing would grab so much attention from the press when there is likely a state of the art command center and continuity of government bunker right below their feet.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",Did This Beluga Whale Escape From A Russian Navy Training Program?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last week, Norwegian fishermen freed a beluga from an unusual harness with markings suggesting it had originated in St. Petersburg, Russia, prompting speculation that the Kremlin has been training these whales for military purposes in the Arctic region . The incident comes at a time when tensions between the Norway and Russia are particularly high, with Norwegian authorities having criticized their Russian counterparts multiple times in recent years over GPS jamming and conducting mock air strikes on a sensitive radar facility in Norway. Norwegian state broadcaster NRK first reported on the events on Apr. 26, 2019. Fishermen saw the whale near Ingøy island in Norway’s far north Finnmark region on Apr. 24, 2019, and one of them eventually jumped into the water to cut the harness off, believing the beluga was in pain or having difficulty swimming. It was reportedly coming up to boats and scraping up along the side of them in an apparent attempt to get the gear off. Other individuals had reported seeing it in the same area as early as Apr. 22, 2019 . “It came over to us, and as it approached, we saw that it had some sort of harness on it,” fisherman Joar Hesten told NRK , adding that it was very tame, suggesting that it had been in captivity for an extended period of time. “It always searches for boats and people, and then it comes all the way to the boat and tries to rub the straps off.” The exact purpose of the harness is unclear. It appeared to have some sort of mount on it that could accommodate a small camera or another piece of equipment, though there was no such system present when the fishermen cut it off and recovered it, according to NRK. The Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, or Fiskeridirektoratet , also released a picture showing what appeared to be a hook, which the whale could be trained to use to grab objects. Other photos from the Fiskeridirektoratet show that one of the buckles has “Equipment” and “St. Petersburg” molded into it in Roman script, along with an unidentified logo. It does not, as some reports have suggested, appear to include the full phrase “Equipment of St. Petersburg.” The harnessed Belgua gets close to a fishing boat., Fiskeridirektoratet A shot of the harnessed Beluga underwater., Fiskeridirektoratet Fiskeridirektoratet The harness., Fiskeridirektoratet An unknown hook-shaped device Norwegian fishermen recovered along with the harness., Fiskeridirektoratet A bracket on the harness that could have held a camera or other piece of equipment., Fiskeridirektoratet The buckle with “Equipment” and “St. Petersburg” written on it. , Fiskeridirektoratet “I have colleagues here who put satellite tags on white whales [belugas], but they do not use this type of equipment. I have never seen anyone doing research this way,” Martin Biuw of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research told NRK . “If this [whale] comes from Russia, and there is great reason to believe it, then it is not Russian scientists, but rather the [Russian] navy that has done this.” A map showing Ingøy island, to the north, in relation to St. Petersburg., Google Maps Trained belugas could certainly have military value, given their ability to swim and dive comfortably even in the extremely cold waters above the Arctic Circle and traverse long distances. In captivity, the whales have shown the ability to swim down to depths deeper than 1,900 feet and, in at least one instance, all the way down to 2,860 feet . This is far deeper than human divers and even many submarines can manage. A beluga trained to hunt for and spot certain objects and equipped with a camera would potentially be able to conduct certain underwater reconnaissance tasks, including locating underwater sensors and mines. They might also be able to inspect ships in port or help guard maritime facilities against enemy divers and saboteurs. There is certainly precedent for this. The Soviet Union had a naval marine mammal program based in the Black Sea during the Cold War, which focused primarily on training dolphins for the same kind of underwater tasks. After the Cold War ended, the remnants of this program ended up Ukraine and languished. After Russia illegally seized Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, what was left of the infrastructure, as well as reportedly some trained dolphins, returned to Russian control . All of these dolphins reportedly died , with Ukrainians saying the animals had been unwilling to perform for their new masters and Russia countering by saying the animals had been poorly cared for , to begin with. Marine mammal programs are hardly limited to Russia, either. The U.S. Navy continues to train both bottlenose dolphins and sea lions as part of its own Marine Mammal Program . As with the Russians, these animals and their handlers primarily train to find objects underwater, such as mines, and guard against hostile frogmen. A US Navy dolphin with a camera attached to its fin jumps from the water in the Persian Gulf during a training exercise., USN Both the United States and the Soviet Union studied the use of belugas in the past, but there has been no evidence previously of those programs reaching an operational state. Given the increasing strategic significance of the Arctic region and the Kremlin’s very public push to increase its military presence and operational capacity above the Arctic Circle, it would hardly be out of the realm of reason for the Russians to at least re-investigate the practicality of using these whales for military purposes. The “St. Petersburg” marking on the harness would not have to mean that the unit responsible for these animals is based there, either. The city is home to the Russian Navy’s top headquarters, but Russia’s Northern Fleet operates from a constellation of bases on the White Sea and the Barents Sea further to the north. There are reportedly two facilities in Murmansk on the Barents Sea that are contributing, or have in the past, to Russian military marine mammal programs. It would not be unreasonable to assume that the Russians could be training to use the marine mammals in and around Norway or that the whale simply escaped from a training exercise in the region. On Apr. 25, 2019, the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet did announce it had concluded a major drill involving 20 ships in the Barents Sea, though there was no mention of marine mammals participating. In the past few years, both Russia and NATO have stepped up military exercises in and around Scandinavia . Norway has blamed electronic warfare systems taking part in the Kremlin’s drills in its northwestern regions for GPS outages in Finnmark on multiple occasions . In addition, for two years running now , the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), also known as the Etterretningstjenesten or E-tjenesten , the country’s top military intelligence agency, has accused the Russian military of provocative exercises involving mock air strikes against a secretive radar installation in the coastal town of Vardø, which is also in Finnmark. This array reportedly has ballistic missile defense and other intelligence gathering capabilities, though the Norwegians insist it is only for monitoring general air and space activity. A map the E-tjenesten released earlier in 2019 showing the route of a Russian aerial task force during a training exercise that included a mock attack run on the radar facility in Vardø., Etterretningstjenesten Still, if the beluga is part of an as yet unacknowledged Russian Arctic marine mammal program, it seems curious that the buckle would so conspicuously include an apparent link to Russia, but also include writing Roman script instead of Cyrillic. It is possible that this is specifically to allow for plausible deniability. There may be more innocuous explanations for the harnessed beluga, that are still linked to Russia, too. In February 2019 , Russia’s Federal Security Service, better known by the Russian acronym FSB, raided a fish farm in the country’s far east and seized 11 orcas and 90 belugas that had been living in cramped, squalid conditions ahead of sale to aquariums in China. An online campaign that American actor and activist Leonardo DiCarpio had led was credited as helping push Russian authorities, and President Vladimir Putin himself, to act. However, by March 2019 , there was still disagreement about how, where, and when, to release the whales. However, There is no indication that those whales have gotten released yet and there no evidence a harness like the one seen on the beluga near Ingøy would be part of a release operation. In addition, the Russian government has given the people of the village of Nil’moguba special license to capture belugas to train and then sell to aquariums and waterparks. Nil’moguba is located in the semi-autonomous Republic of Karelia, which sits on the white sea, and is less than 1,000 miles by sea to Ingøy island. A map showing Ingøy island to the north, Nil’moguba in the middle, and St. Petersburg to the south., Google Maps So far, the Kremlin has not issued any statement of its own on the matter. The circumstantial evidence is compelling, but there’s still too little information to say for sure that a trained Russian Navy “military whale” has escaped, or whether a captive beluga might have gotten free from civilian handlers.

Boeing’s MQ-25 Stingray tanker drone— the aircraft that won the U.S. Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) contract last Fall—is on the move in a fairly spectacular fashion. Motorists, including one of our readers, saw the exotic looking drone being trucked on Missouri roads on the evening of Sunday, April 28th, 2019. Apparently, the aircraft is headed to MidAmerica Airport for testing. Up until now, the MQ-25 prototype hasn’t left the confines of St. Louis’s Lambert International Airport, where Boeing’s tactical aircraft plant is. MidAmerica Airport is co-located with Scott AFB on the outskirts of St. Louis. According to our contacts at Boeing, the MQ-25 will conduct flight testing from MidAmerican Airport. Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg told investors on a January 30th phone call that the company plans to fly their existing MQ-25 demonstrator in 2019. The first of four Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) aircraft the Navy has ordered is scheduled to fly for the first time sometime in 2021. Clearly, using the existing aircraft Boeing already has will help offset risk and enhance the quality of the EMD aircraft and their support infrastructure once they roll out of Boeing’s St. Louis plant. Reader submission Reader submission Moving exotic looking aircraft via road can spur quite the buzz and plenty of theories to go along with it. At least in the MQ-25’s case, that hasn’t seemed to have occurred. MidAmerica Airport is connected via a long taxiway with Scott AFB.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 12, 2019",Pentagon Investigation Says Acting SecDef Shanahan Was Justifiably Critical Of The F-35,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon’s top watchdog has concluded that Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, has not acted in a prejudicial way against Lockheed Martin or the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter or otherwise unfairly favored products from his former employer. When it comes to the F-35, the investigation bases its conclusion in large part on one particularly important factor, that many senior U.S. military officials , as well as individuals from other arms of the U.S. government, have been critical of the program and its management in public, and for good reason , too. The Department of Defense’s Office of the Inspector General released its finding on Apr. 25, 2019 , a little over a month after initiating its investigation. News of allegations that Shanahan had unfairly disparaged the F-35 and instead advocated for the purchase of F-15EX Advanced Eagle and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, both Boeing products, first began to publicly surface in December 2018 , after Secretary of Defense James Mattis resigned over President Donald Trump’s order to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. However, some of these allegations dated all the way back to Shanahan’s appointment as Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2017. The Inspector General also looked into whether Shanahan had an unethical impact on the KC-46 Pegasus tanker program, another Boeing product, and had tried to steer other work toward his former employer. “We did not substantiate any of the allegations. We determined that Mr. Shanahan fully complied with his ethics agreements and his ethical obligations regarding Boeing,” the Inspector General report says unequivocally in its conclusion. “We determined that Mr. Shanahan did not make the alleged comments and did not promote Boeing or disparage its competitors.” Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan., DOD Investigators interviewed more than 30 people and reviewed thousands of pages of documentation in the course of their review. Those documents included a detailed “screening arrangement,” by which Pentagon officials ensure that Shanahan remains recused from decision making that might involve a conflict of interest with Boeing. By all accounts, this process has worked as intended. A graphical depiction of the screening arrangement the Pentagon had put in place to keep then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan from engaging in decision making that might expose a conflict of interest with Boeing. A similar arrangement remains in place now that he has become Acting Secretary of Defense., DODIG The Inspector General’s Office is keen to stress in its report that Shanahan certainly has complained about the F-35, but about the program and how all parties involved have executed it, rather than the plane itself. The investigators, however, found that his complaints were not only not out of the ordinary in the halls of the Pentagon, but were “substantive” in nature. “We also concluded that Mr. Shanahan did not ‘repeatedly dump’ on the F-35 aircraft,” the report states. “We determined that Mr. Shanahan’s comments about the F-35 program were substantive, related to the program’s performance, and were consistent with comments about the F-35 program made by other senior Government officials.” Shanahan became Deputy Defense Secretary on July 19, 2017. That same month, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the head of the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), told investigators he had heard Shanahan say the F-35 was “fucked up” and that the Deputy Defense Secretary appeared to be referring to the plane itself. “We brought data to debunk that [the aircraft is] screwed up. We brought the warfighter in. They talked about flying the [F-35], and they talk about how good [the F-35] is,” Winter told investigators. “So it started – that – when the warfighter talked [Mr. Shanahan] goes, ‘Okay. [The F-35 aircraft] works. But it costs too much.’ ‘Yes, sir.’ Okay. So now the [F-35] program is screwed up because it costs too much. It’s screwed up because you are accepting the poor performance of your industry partners to include Lockheed Martin.” From left to right, the F-35C, F-35B, and F-35A., Lockheed Martin Winter not only did not try to disabuse Shanahan of the belief that the F-35 program cost too much, he publicly voiced similar sentiments himself in February 2018. That month, the Vice Admiral said he felt Lockheed Martin was not negotiating in good faith and that it had not done enough to help bring down the unit price of all three variants of the Joint Strike Fighter. This reality almost certainly contributed to the decision by then-Secretary of Defense Mattis to order Shanahan to take a hard look at the F-35 program, which occurred between April and May 2018 according to the Inspector General. Investigators talked to Mattis, who rebuffed the idea that this review had been biased against the F-35 or Lockheed Martin, telling them: “He was trying to get the program to a point that we can have confidence in the numbers we said we were going to buy. If you say you’re going to buy them and the cost is supposed to go down and each block comes off, and the plant gets more efficient, the supply chain is more efficient is not happening that we say that the cost per flight hour is going to be lower and the cost per flight hour is not going lower then you’ve got a problem. The program is unsustainable.” A number of other senior U.S. military officers and civilian officials further confirmed that Shanahan had been critical of the F-35 program and its price tag, but not without reason and not at a level inconsistent with statements from other individuals. “Many people criticized the F-35 program. I’ve criticized the F-35 program in public,” U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command and nominee to become the next Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in his interview with the Inspector General. The final report also includes the list of statements seen below. From top to bottom, statements from U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness Veronica Daigle, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Dr. Michael Griffin, and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Dr. Will Roper., DODIG The report also cites similar commentary from other U.S. government entities, especially the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Just between April 2016 and June 2018, GAO has issued three highly critical reports regarding the F-35 Program , adding to dozens of other public reviews over the years. On Apr. 25, 2019, the same day the Pentagon’s Inspector General released its review of the investigation into Shanahan, GAO dropped yet another report , highlighting severe supply chain challenges, and associated costs, that the F-35 program is facing. The Congressional watchdog found that between May and November 2018, F-35s across the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy were not able to fly 30 percent of the time, on average, simply due to a lack of spare parts. The difficulty in obtaining the correct spare parts, and getting spare parts in general, is an issue the GAO drew attention to in 2017. The JPO still says its goal is to be able to get parts removed from aircraft, repaired or replaced, and available for distribution to units in need within 60 to 90 days. As of November 2018, this process took an average of 188 days. GAO On top of that, significant stores of spare parts are no longer usable since the U.S. military purchased them years ago, before Lockheed Martin made a host of changes and upgrades to the Joint Strike Fighters as part of a process known as “concurrency,” which you can read about more here . During one recent deployment, the Marines found that 44 percent of their allotted spare parts were incompatible with their F-35Bs in their present configuration. All of this increases sustainment costs and contributes to the absymal full mission capable rates for all F-35 variants across the services, something The War Zone has previously analyzed in depth . GAO says that based on the current supply chain problems, at the very best under the most optimal conditions, the U.S. military’s F-35 fleets will never be able to get to a full mission capable rate above approximately 70 percent, 10 percent less than then-Secretary of Defense Mattis had laid out in 2018 as a goal for the services to reach by the end of this year. GAO On top of all that, Shanahan’s attitude, and his changed opinions on the performance of the F-35 as an aircraft, are also markedly similar in many respects to that of President Trump’s, who openly disparaged the Joint Strike Fighter on the campaign trail. Using the Freedom of Information Act, The War Zone recently obtained briefings Trump received in 2016 as President-Elect, including on that covered the F-35, that acknowledge, without caveat, that the program was riddled by cost overruns and mismanagement for years that have left as a lasting impact despite “marked improvement.” A slide from a briefing the F-35 JPO gave to then-President-Elect Donald Trump in 2016 that noted it is “difficult to overcome a troubled past.”, USAF via FOIA Trump walked out of those meetings publicly declaring that there was a need to get the F-35 program’s costs under control and later claimed to have been personally responsible for dropping unit costs, an assertion that remains dubious . The F-35 JPO and Lockheed Martin have worked to drive the unit price down, but serious concerns remain about how much money will be necessary to operate and sustain the aircraft over their expected service life. Just days ago, it emerged that a revised Pentagon estimate of the F-35’s final research and development costs had added more than $20 billion to account for the still-ongoing Block 4 upgrade effort, which had been missing previously from this tally. The total projected operating and support costs through 2070 also grew by more than $75 billion, raising that figure to $1.196 trillion. All told, the Inspector General’s investigation into Shanahan’s behavior is not only a vindication of the “screening arrangement” and his personal efforts to avoid any appearance of bias, but also a stark reminder that reasoned criticism of the F-35 program is not, in of itself, unethical. The release of the report notably comes as opposition is building in Congress to a proposed U.S. Air Force purchase of Boeing F-15EX fighter jets and Lockheed Martin voicing frustration at that service’s plans to purchase slightly fewer F-35s in the near term. Dozens of F-35s prepare to take off during a large scale readiness exercise, also known as an “Elephant Walk,” at Hill Air Force Base in Utah in November 2018 ., USAF “I think the frustrating piece for us is the United States Air Force and we’ll continue working with our customer and with representatives in the government on what’s the right path forward there,” Lockheed Martin’s Chief Financial Officer Ken Possenriede said during a quarterly earnings call on Apr. 23, 2019. “How they manage what they buy year to year, that’s always been a challenge as they look at what their overall needs are relative to the budgets that they have to work with,” Lockheed Martin’s CEO Marillyn Hewson added during the conference call. The Air Force’s planned purchase of F-15EXs was based on the recommendation of the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office, which itself was informed, in part, by concerns about whether the F-35 program costs would become unsustainable. You can read more in detail about the evolution of F-15EX effort here and here . It has also since emerged that CAPE was also influenced by industrial base concerns and a desire to ensure that multiple companies would continue to compete in the “tactical aircraft portfolio.” An artist’s conception of Boeing’s F-15EX for the U.S. Air Force., Boeing If nothing else, the report could finally pave the way for Shanahan’s possible nomination and confirmation as Secretary of Defense after months of him serving in this role only in an “acting” capacity. But the investigation’s tangential findings regarding the F-35 program, its costs, and its overall sustainability, also seem to point to what’s to come in the next few months as a larger budget battle over future fighter jet purchases seems increasingly inevitable. When Shanahan goes to defend the Pentagon’s proposed budget for the 2020 Fiscal Year, he will now not only have an independent review that shows his critical comments have been fact-based and unbiased, but one that says he’s hardly alone in those views.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 6, 2018",Behold America’s New And Desperately Needed Heavy Icebreaker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After years of back and forth, the U.S. government has finally issued a contract for the U.S. Coast Guard’s first new heavy icebreaker in decades. VT Halter Marine will build the three new Polar Security Cutters, or PSCs, and expects to deliver the first ship in 2024. These ships are absolutely critical to the United States continued ability to conduct operations in ice-filled waters, especially in the increasingly strategic Arctic region . The Pentagon announced the deal, valued at nearly $746 million, in a daily press release on Apr. 23, 2019 . The U.S. Navy’s Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) issued the contract, but will manage the program together with the Coast Guard, according to a separate statement . The Coast Guard, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, and the Navy, which is also looking to increase its presence in the Arctic specifically, will both contribute to funding the project, as well. The bulk of the work will occur at VT Halter Marine ‘s shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. “Against the backdrop of great power competition, the Polar Security Cutter is key to our nation’s presence in the polar regions,” Admiral Karl L. Schultz, Commandant of the Coast Guard, said in a statement . “This contract award marks an important step towards building the nation’s full complement of six polar icebreakers to meet the unique mission demands that have emerged from increased commerce, tourism, research, and international activities in the Arctic and Antarctic.” The Coast Guard ultimately plans to purchase three heavy icebreakers, as well as three medium icebreakers. This new contract only covers the heavy ships, which have also been referred to as Heavy Polar Icebreakers (HPIB) in the past. Heavy icebreakers typically have the capability to break through ice at least 10 feet thick, if not thicker, while medium icebreakers generally can only manage to crack through ice up to around 8 feet thick. VT Halter Marine has yet to release any statement of its own or issue any detailed specifics regarding its design. The Mississippi-headquartered shipbuilder was one of five companies to win design review contracts from the Coast Guard in February 2017 . The others were Bollinger Shipyards, Fincantieri Marine Group, General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), and Huntington Ingalls. The contract announcement said that designs from only two other companies had been under consideration in the end, but did not name them. Previous contracting documents from the U.S. Coast Guard put the projected displacement of the future PSCs at approximately 17,690 tons. The Coast Guard’s lone operational heavy icebreaker, the USCGC Polar Star , displaces less than 14,000 tons with a full load. An artist’s conception of VT Halter Marine’s PSC design, first obtained by USNI News , shows the ship will have a number of important features, including a second, higher bridge for better downward visibility during icebreaking operations and a helipad with hangar at the stern. An artist’s conception of the VT Halter Marine Polar Security Cutter design., VT Halter Marine via USNI News In addition, the graphic appears to show a thruster in the bow to help in maneuvering through ice-filled waters. The ship will also use a propulsion system with propellers mounted in traversable azipods , again to give the ship improved handling. Azipods contain an electric motor that drives the propeller, with the power coming from whatever system is generating electricity for the rest of the ship. As is often the case with azipods, the examples on the PSC have propellers that face forward and “pull” the ship, rather than traditional propulsion arrangements that involve rear facing screws. All told, the new PSCs should be larger and more capable than the Polar Star the Coast Guard operates now. The service is in desperate need of new icebreakers in general, at a time when the Arctic region, in particular, is only becoming more important economically and geopolitically. At present, the Coast Guard technically has two heavy icebreakers, the USCGC Polar Star and the USCGC Polar Sea , as well as the medium icebreaker USCGC Healy . In reality, since 2010, the Polar Sea has been in an inactive state after a major engine failure and now serves as a source of spare parts for the Polar Star . The USCGC Polar Star ., USCG Lockheed Shipbuilding delivered the two Polar class icebreakers in the late 1970s and, despite a number of major overhauls and service life extensions, they have only become increasingly more difficult to operate and maintain. To underscore the point, in February 2019 , Polar Star suffered a major fire in her incinerator room after supporting a supply run to the U.S. Antarctic Program ’s McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The blaze took two hours to get under control and caused not insignificant damage, though a final cost estimate is still forthcoming. The year before , the ship had also suffered an engine failure and flooding while operating near McMurdo. Thankfully there were no injuries in either case. The Healy is newer than the Polars , having gotten commissioned in 1999, but is also less capable. These three icebreakers are the only ones that any arm of the U.S. government owns, too. In 2017 report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) revealed that the Coast Guard had only been able to perform 78 percent of assigned icebreaking missions between 2011 and 2016. For years now, The National Science Foundation has charted an additional icebreaker to help make up for the shortfall. The Coast Guard has been working hard since 2014 to acquire new icebreakers, without success, and even just last year , there were concerns that budget cuts could threaten the program. The important thing now will be ensuring that the new heavy icebreakers arrive on schedule. In September 2018, GAO called into question whether or not the service’s program schedule was realistic, which you can read about in more detail here . At that time, the Coast Guard and the Navy said the expected the first new heavy icebreaker to get delivered in 2023, a year earlier than the current plan. The Coast Guard is already looking at another potentially costly life extension program for the Polar Star to avoid a gap starting in 2020 in which the U.S government would own no heavy icebreakers whatsoever. The Navy says that there are monetary incentives in the new contract with VT Halter Marine for early delivery. A timeline showing the projected life of the Polar Star, with and without a life extension effort, along with the projected delivery dates for the three Polar Security Cutters, starting in 2024., GAO This sort of gap is one the United States can ill afford. Due to global climate change, the annual periods where season ice presents a major risk to ships are shortening, but at the same time, this has only increased interest around the world in exploring potential natural resource wealth, as well as new commercial shipping routes , especially in the Arctic. This, in turn, has raised the prospect of conflicting territorial claims and the potential for violent competition in that region between the United States and its “greater power” competitors, Russia and China. Russia has been particularly active in expanding its Arctic infrastructure for both civil and military purposes and has built 14 icebreakers for various arms of the country’s government just since 2013, according to the Coast Guard . The Russians have dozens of additional icebreakers still in service, too. China has also been building additional icebreakers and is now in the process of building a 30,000-ton displacement nuclear-powered design . A snapshot of major maritime developments in the Arctic region since 2013, according to a recent US Coast Guard report., USCG “The Coast Guard is the sole provider and operator of the U.S. polar capable fleet, but [it] currently does not have the capability or capacity to assure access in the high latitudes,” the service said in a recently issued Arctic strategy review , the first it has produced since 2013. “Closing the gap requires persistent investment in capabilities and capacity for polar operations, including the Polar Security Cutter.” The Coast Guard, with the help of the Navy, has now finally taken the first step in acquiring the new heavy icebreakers that it desperately needs.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 30, 2019",Lockheed Offers Japan Access To F-35 Code As Part Of Stealth Fighter Proposal: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government is reportedly considering approving the disclosure of at least a portion of the computer code behind the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ’s avionics and mission systems to Japan to support the development of a new stealth fighter jet for that country. Given that this is Lockheed Martin’s proprietary data, this would strongly point to ongoing discussions between that company and Japanese authorities about the potential design that blends together features and design considerations leveraged from the F-35 and the F-22 Raptor . Japanese newspaper The Yomiuri Shimbun first reported on the potential arrangement on Apr. 18, 2019. Just a little over a year ago, the reports first emerged that Japan was in talks with Lockheed Martin about a new aircraft derived, at least in some part, from the F-35 and the F-22 that would meet that country’s requirements for a stealthy fifth-generation fighter jet. At present, Japan also plans to purchase 147 F-35s, including more than 100 F-35As primarily to replace its fleet of aging F-4EJ Phantom II aircraft, very few of which still remain in service now, and 42 F-35Bs to equip its Izumo -class carriers . Some of the Joint Strike Fighters could end up supplanting a portion of Japan’s F-15J fleet, as well. Following a recent crash of one of the Japan Air Self Defense Force’s (JASDF) F-35As, the country reiterated its intention to continue buying the fighter jets. One of Japan’s F-35As., JASDF The new jet would be mainly a successor to the JASDF’s F-2 fighters , a derivative of the F-16 Viper that General Dynamics developed together with Japanese firms in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, General Dynamics sold the F-16 line to Lockheed Martin. The reported new design, sometimes referred to as the F-3, would possibly leverage the F-35’s advanced avionics and mission systems and feature an airframe that takes at least some cues from the F-22. Japan tried for years to secure approval to purchase Raptors without success and Lockheed Martin has long since shuttered that production line . Using a modified version of the F-35’s computer brain , along with other mission systems from the Joint Strike Fighter, or porting them over directly to a new airframe design, would help drastically lower developmental costs, which have historically been extremely high for any new stealth fighter. Avionics and mission systems software by itself is among the most challenging and labor-intensive parts of a new fighter jet program and the F-35’s architecture is already set up in a particularly advanced way to fuse together a vast array of information from different onboard and offboard sources. An image showing the integration of various systems and sensors as displayed to the F-35’s pilot., Lockheed Martin The F-35’s software has at least eight million lines of code and deeply automates the functions of various components that make up the aircraft, including flight controls, weapons deployment, sensor fusion, electronic attack , electronic surveillance , communications, navigation, and electro-optical and radar sensor systems. In addition, Lockheed Martin has already expended considerable effort in fixing and improving the F-35’s long-troubled software over the years, which represents additional developmental steps, added risk, and associated costs, that Japan could largely skip if it decides to take this route. The notional F-3 could end up with a version of the still-in-development Block 4 software package for the F-35, which will offer even more capability, the ability to use the newest sensor configuration, and the integration of new weaponry, but has also proven to be particularly expensive . Using the same software and other mission systems from the F-35 would also give the notional F-3 valuable commonality with Japan’s existing Joint Strike Fighters. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor., USAF Japan’s interest now in getting U.S. government approval for Lockheed Martin to release portions of the F-35’s source code centers on a desire to make it easier for Japanese companies to integrate locally made components into the new fighter jet design, according to The Yomiuri Shimbun . The American defense giant has already proposed a design that would physically allow for the eventual replacement of the original mission system with elements from Mitsubishi Electric, as well as the use of the locally-produced IHI XF9-1 engine , according to a report from Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review in August 2018. Having greater access to the source code would make it easier to add Japan-specific weapons to the design in the future, too. In 2017, Nikkei had also reported that European missile consortium MBDA and Mitsubishi Electric had entered into a partnership to build a new beyond-visual-range-capable air-to-air missile for the country’s F-35s. This would be a derivative of MBDA’s Meteor, which you can read about in more detail here , with a Japanese-made radar seeker and other components. The possible new deal with Lockheed Martin could also put Japan in a relatively unique position, as the company has kept details about the F-35’s source code a closely guarded secret in the past. This could offer Japan added benefits it is also allowed to leverage work on the F-3 in the development and integration of upgrades for its Joint Strike Fighter down the road. There have been few other reported details about Lockheed Martin’s proposed fighter jet design, proposals that could turn out to have involved multiple potential designs. A previous Nikkei report said that the aircraft would have larger and stronger wings than the F-22, allowing it to hold more fuel for greatly increased combat radius while in its maximum stealthy configuration. The F-22’s combat radius has much to be desired while operating without external fuel tanks. However, the F-35A’s publicly stated combat radius is already close to 700 miles, which is relatively substantial by current fighter standards. An F-22 carrying drop tanks, which negate its stealth qualities., USAF Given how long the F-22 has been out of production, and how much experience Lockheed Martin has gained in the development of stealth fighters since then, it already seems possible, if not probable, that the company’s proposal involves an airframe derived as much from the F-35A as the F-22. This could possibly include a configuration that eliminates the tradeoff in the F-35’s basic airframe design required to maintain commonality with the short and vertical takeoff and landing-capable F-35B. Questions do remain about whether or not Japan can afford to acquire a second type of stealthy fighter jet, especially one that is at all close to a clean-sheet design. Lockheed Martin’s proposal certainly does have the benefit of the company’s years of experience with both the F-22 and the F-35, as well as its pioneering work on rapid prototyping and manufacturing science . The Joint Strike Fighter itself incorporates some lessons learned from the Raptor, including a stealthy coating that is easier to maintain than the one on the Raptors. But back in August 2018, the estimated unit cost of the new aircraft was around $216 million, for an order of 70 total aircraft, and as low as $190 million for purchase of 140 planes, according to Nikkei . The flyaway cost of an F-35A has now dropped to under $90 million . In October 2018, The Mainichi Shimbun reported, citing anonymous government officials, that the Japanese Ministry of Defense had rejected the Lockheed Martin proposal as too expensive. The country’s authorities also said offers from Boeing and the Eurofighter consortium, for F-15 Advanced Eagles and EF-2000 Typhoons , respectively, did not meet their requirements. Japan is also facing increasing domestic political pressure over increased defense spending at a time when overall government budgets are contracting. In December 2018, Nikkei reported that Japanese authorities were looking to sell some of the country’s older F-15Js just to help offset the costs of buying F-35s. So far, there is no evidence that Japan is moving forward with this proposal, however, and the country is also in the midst of upgrading these jets , which would make it even less likely that it would suddenly decide to sell them off in the end. A JASDF F-15J Eagle., Cp9asngf via Wikimedia Still, earlier in April 2019, Shigeru Ishikawa, an LDP member who unsuccessfully challenged current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for the party leadership last year, wrote a personal blog post in which he argued against Japan embarking on the development of a domestic stealth fighter, even with foreign cooperation. Ishikawa proposed developing a lower cost advanced fighter jet aircraft, along the lines of the Saab Gripen , which the country might also be able to export. The promise of additional access into the F-35’s code could now be Lockheed Martin’s way of making its proposal more attractive. The company’s initial offer had reportedly already included a path to Japanese companies eventually taking over some 60 percent of the total production of the final aircraft. Using more of the F-35’s existing systems architecture and an airframe that borrows more from the Joint Strike Fighter’s design than from the older F-22, could also help in reducing the final unit price, as well as the developmental costs. Still, Japan may be wary of this plan given its experience with the F-2. That aircraft turned out to be significantly more expensive than contemporary F-16s, in no small part due to its then-cutting-edge advanced electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and many of the promised industrial offsets did not materialize . A JASDF F-2 fighter jet., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries It’s not hard to see how a similar situation might emerge in the development of a new F-3 specifically for Japan. An immediate hurdle to overcome is that bringing in additional partners, the easiest way for the Japanese and Lockheed Martin spread out the financial burdens and bring down costs, could be a non-starter for this proposed program. If Lockheed Martin, or its Japanese partners, were to offer this aircraft on the international market, it would almost certainly find itself in competition with former company’s own premier product, the F-35, in at least some cases. Just recently, the United States indicated it was looking to expand the Joint Strike Fighter program to include Greece , Poland , Romania, Singapore , and Spain . In addition, the Joint Strike Fighter has a powerful lobby within Congress and among other advocacy groups , which has already come out strongly against the U.S. Air Force’s plans to acquire a very limited number of F-15EX aircraft, despite Lockheed Martin’s own very public insistence that it will not threaten F-35 purchases. WIth the AIr Force already facing a fight with Congress over the F-15EX program, it seems increasingly unlikely that it would partner with Japan on the F-3 project, which would also help defray the program’s costs. Lockheed Martin was only driven to consider releasing portions of the F-35 computer code to Japan in the first place in response to a competing stealth fighter offer from the United Kingdom, according to The Yomiuri Shimbun . Though the newspaper did not specify what this offer was, in 2018, there were multiple reports that Japanese authorities were investigating whether or not to join the Tempest fighter jet program , which the U.K.’s BAE Systems is presently leading. The British government and BAE have already shown an eagerness to find international partners to help in the development of this aircraft. An artist’s conception of the BAE Systems Tempest, which Japan has also reportedly expressed interest in potentially acquiring., UK MOD Lockheed Martin allowing greater access to the computer code running the F-35’s avionics and missions systems as part of the development of a new stealth fighter could certainly be a very appealing counter-offer. But with limited freedom, if any, to bring in additional partners to help further reduce the costs involved, it might not be enough. Of course, all of this is dependent on whether or not the Japanese government ultimately feels it can afford any new stealth fighter in the near future. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly identified Shigeru Ishikawa as a former F-15 pilot and Japan’s 4th Chief of Staff the country’s Self Defense Forces. Ishikawa was neither.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, Russia launched the world’s longest submarine, the shadowy K-139 Belgorod , a modified Oscar II -class boat, which is set to become the country’s first operational launch platform for the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed long-range torpedo. The Kremlin hid most of Belgorod from public view during the launching ceremony, but what it did show still offers important clues about the boat’s other “special projects” missions, including intelligence gathering and acting as a mothership for smaller manned and unmanned submarines. On Apr. 23, 2019, Belgorod , which The War Zone previously profiled in detail here , slid down the slipway and into the water at Sevmash Shipyard in Severodvinsk in Northern Russia, which sits on the White Sea. Vladimir Putin, who was preparing for a meeting with North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un in Vladivostok in Russia’s Far East region, watched the ceremony via a television link-up, according to state-run media outlet TASS . Construction will now continue with the boat in the water and the Russian Navy is expected to formally commission the submarine sometime in 2020. Sevmash first laid down Belgorod in 1992, less than a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It remained there in its unfinished state for nearly a decade. In 2010, Russia reportedly began planning to convert it to a special projects submarine, a process that officially began in 2012. Ship Commander Captain First Rank Anton Alyokhin smashes a bottle of champagne on Belgorod’s lower left rudder during the submarine’s launch ceremony on Apr. 23, 2019., Igor Ageyenko / Sputnik  via AP The Oscar II -class guided missile submarines , also known as Project 949AMs, are already some of the largest in the world. Their hullform is notably very wide to accommodate 24 huge P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missiles housed in long compartments located between the outer and inner hulls on each side of the submarine. Belgorod ‘s refit added nearly 100 feet to the boat’s overall length. This makes the K-139, also known as the Project 09852, longer than even the monstrous Soviet-era Typhoon -class ballistic missile submarines, of which only one remains in limited service with the Russian Navy. An Oscar II class submarine in port. , Via Reddit Pictures from the ceremony at Sevmash only show the rear of the submarine. Experts have noted that some features, such as the tube to hold a towed sonar array at the top of the upper rudder, are carry-overs from the Oscar II -class. The submarine’s two propellers were covered during the ceremony, making it impossible to tell for sure whether Belgorod uses the same seven-bladed design as the Project 949AM. There’s no indication that this special projects submarine has a more modern pump-jet design that could offer improved speed and acoustic signature performance. The coverings do show an apparent protrusion from the back of the screws, which indicate that the boat has what is known as propeller boss vortex diffusers, which you can read about in more detail here , to help reduce its acoustic signature. A look at the rear of Belgorod during the launch ceremony., TASS Igor Ageyenko / Sputnik  via AP Igor Ageyenko / Sputnik  via AP Igor Ageyenko / Sputnik  via AP A view of the propellers on a standard Oscar II -class submarine for comparison., via Reddit But even the limited rear views do show a number of significant differences between the Project 09852 design and the earlier Project 949AMs that do point to other potential features on the submarine designed for various other special missions. For one, both of the lower rudders are significantly different from those on previous Oscar II s. Both of them are reinforced and squared off at the bottom. The right one has an opening and some additional features that could point to the ability to accommodate some sort of additional towed device. Another possibility is that this could be a cable layer, possibly feeding from a reel located inside the hull. Most notably, there is a prominent bulge at the rear of the underside of the hull. This could be where spools of cable are stowed and ran out the back of the submarine through the fitting in the lower rudder assembly during deployment operations. Pictures from the launch ceremony show a pair of circular doors and a larger rectangular one on the side of this bulge, as well. Though the circular doors could hold defensive countermeasures, their diameter is significantly larger than that of most modern decoys . In addition, more modern submarines typically launch these payloads aft, rather than sideways. Though Belgorod is, at its core, a Cold War-era submarine, this bulge is a new feature. Adding in an outdated sideways launching self-protection system seems less likely than the possibility that these doors may point to a more specialized system, such as retractable auxiliary lateral thrusters or water jets for precise maneuvering. In the latter case, the doors could be part of a single system, with water getting sucked in on one side and pushed out the other. One of the main missions for Russian special projects submarines is investigating, manipulating, or retrieving relatively small objects deep underwater, such as submarine cables on the sea floor. This kind of work requires fine movements and the ability to “hover” in a relatively stable position underwater. This might also explain the reinforced lower rudders if Belgorod is at all expected to “land” on the seabed during certain missions. Other subs Russia has outfitted for special missions , as well as American ones , have often featured retractable skids to help support them on the seafloor. Being able to hold a particular position underwater could also be very important for launching and recovering manned or unmanned submarines. In 2015, in what appears to have been a deliberate leak, a briefing slide appeared in a Russian state television broadcast that showed Belgorod with a smaller submarine nestled in the underside of its hull. It’s not clear what this other submarine was, but some have posited that it could be the equally shadowy Project 10831 Losharik nuclear-powered midget submarine, another one of Russia’s special projects boats. A slide from an unclassified US Northern Command briefing in 2016 specifically notes the ability to better detect and track “dark targets,” such as the Losharik , was of significant interest.  , NORTHCOM Unfortunately, there are no views of the top or the bottom of Belgorod ‘s central hull, or of the front of the submarine, which could offer additional evidence of its capabilities and potential missions. The briefing slide that emerged in 2015 also indicated that the submarine would have some sort of additional object on top of the fuselage, which some have suggested might be a nuclear reactor intended to support underwater sensor networks, and that the boat will be able to launch a long-range nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed torpedo now known as Poseidon. Additional views could help confirm just how many of the torpedoes, also known as the Status-6 or Kanyon, Belgorod may be able to carry and how.  Some have posited that the submarine could launch them from forward-firing tubes built into the gap between the hulls left from the removal of the P-700 cruise missiles. Another route might be to simply leverage the existing missile launch arrangement and modify it to release the Poseidons horizontally or at an angle. The large compartment seems ideally sized for the large nuclear-powered torpedoes, either way. Crews load a P-700 missile into an Oscar II -class submarine., via Reddit Regardless, Belgorod ‘s development is intrinsically linked to this controversial weapon , which reportedly has effectively unlimited range and design features that make it very difficult to detect. By every indication, the weapon is meant to give Russia a second-strike deterrent capability that is entirely immune to U.S. missile defenses. The torpedo will also reportedly carry a particularly dirty nuclear warhead. The resulting blast might be enough to evaporate all the water in a harbor or create a huge tidal wave that sends contaminated water flooding over what’s left of a target area, bathing it in dangerous levels of radiation to impede any continued activity at impacted sites. In March 2019, CNBC reported that U.S. intelligence assessments say that Poseidon will not be operational before 2027 on Belgorod or other submarines. The month before, the Russian Ministry of Defense had released the video below, showing an underwater test of the weapon. A computer-generated video that Russia released in 2018 as part of President Vladimir Putin’s annual state-of-the-union speech, in which he also officially confirmed the existence of Poseidon, has suggested that Belgorod could also launch the nuclear-powered Harpsichord 2P-PM mini-drone submarine from a hangar on top of the hull. A still from the 2018 computer-generated video showing what appeared to be Belgorod launching a Harpsichord 2P-PM from a hangar on top of the submarine., via Channel One Russia Harpsichord could carry additional sonars and other sensors to help scout ahead of Belgorod , and any manned midget submarine it might be carrying, for objects of interest or to just help map out a particular area or carry out deeper diving investigative, surveillance, and object manipulation missions. Harpsichord is capable of deep diving unmanned operations and is can precisely hold station over objects of interest. , Rubin Design Bureau There’s still much about the final configuration of Belgorod that we don’t know, but now that it’s in the water and headed toward commissioning next year, additional details and imagery may begin to emerge.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 8, 2018",Russian MiG-31 Foxhound Shot Down Its Wingman During Disastrous Live Fire Exercise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new report, citing a leaked Russian government document, says that a crash of MiG-31 Foxhound in Siberia almost two years ago was actually the result of a friendly fire incident during a botched training exercise. In addition, the summary of the mishap suggests that there could be dangerous problems with the aircraft’s Zaslon-AM radar and Baget-55 fire control system that might increase the risk of more accidental shootdowns occurring in the future. Baza , a relatively new Russian independent online investigative news outlet , revealed the new information on Apr. 23, 2019. The incident in question had occurred on Apr. 26, 2017 , over the Telemba proving ground in Buryatia , a semi-autonomous republic within Russia that borders Mongolia. At the time, the Kremlin said that the plane had been on a training exercise, but offered no additional details about the mishap. Both of the Foxhound’s crew survived the incident. “The plane crashed at a proving ground in an unpopulated area. Both pilots ejected themselves,” the Russian Defense Ministry had said in a statement . “They were promptly evacuated. Their life is not in danger.” Until now, there had been no additional information about the mishap at all, which Baza ’s story noted was unusual in of itself. The Russian government does not generally shy away from blaming crashes on pilot error or grounding entire aircraft fleets if an accident exposes a potential systemic issue with the plane in question. A Russian MiG-31 Foxhound., Alex Beltyukov via Wikimedia The report from Rosaviaprom, which oversees the country’s state-owned aviation and space enterprises, that Baza obtained does blame pilot error for the mishap. But it just so happens that they determined that the crew of the crashed plane and the craw in a second MiG-31 taking part in the training exercise were both at fault. The investigators concluded that the crew in the plane that got shot down had improperly followed procedures, allowing them to stray into the potential line of fire during the live-fire exercise. It also faulted aviators flying the other Foxhound for turning on their Zaslon-AM’s fire control function at the wrong time, cueing an R-33 missile right at their wingman. They further blamed the pilot for firing the weapon when this individual should have known they were not engaging a target drone. The R-33 is a very long-range air-to-air missile that can be loosely considered an analog for the American AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile. It uses Inertial Navigation System guidance to get to the general target area after getting cued in the right direction by the launching aircraft. A semi-active radar homing system helps with initial target acquisition and then provides updated position information during the missile’s mid-course flight profile. An active radar seeker in the missile kicks in during the terminal phase to guide it the rest of the way to the target. Rosaviaprom’s explanation of events isn’t necessarily unrealistic. In August 2018, the pilot of a Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon accidentally fired an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) during a training flight over Estonia. Thankfully no one was injured in that incident, which a subsequent investigation also blamed on pilot error . Video footage also emerged in 2017 showing a Russian Ka-52 alligator attack helicopter inadvertently firing rockets at observers during a training exercise. It would also explain why Russian authorities might have decided not to publicize the cause of the 2017 crash. A steady stream of mishaps in recent years has raised questions about the readiness of Russia’s combat aircraft fleets and its aviators. A friendly fire incident during a training exercise, for any reason, is an embarrassment, in general. But Baza uncovered a significant additional detail in its review of Rosaviaprom’s report. The MiG-31’s Zaslon-AM radar and its Baget-55 fire control computer, referred to collectively by the designation S-800, were not working properly at the time. A MiG-31 at the Paris Air Show in 1991 with its radome removed, exposing the antenna for its Zaslon radar. Four R-33 missiles, among others, are arrayed in front of the plane, as well., DOD The S-800 armament control system is supposed to automatically alert the crew if they inadvertently target an aircraft with a known Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) signal. In this case, it classified the other MiG-31, which had a working IFF system, as an “alien target.” Not only that, investigators found that personnel within the unit in question were aware of “abnormal operation” of the S-800 and that it was not necessarily uncommon. The report also blamed ground crews, who had been unable to determine the source or sources of the problem, for failing to monitor and report the issues. But the investigation itself does not say when the problems may have first begun to present themselves, even approximately, or recommend any sort of suspension in live-fire training activities until the issue had been resolved, according to Baza . It also does not offer any explanation of what the issue or issues might have been that caused the misidentification. A pair of MiG-31s., MiG Baza , citing anonymous sources , suggests that part of the issue might be the simple inability of the computer processors in the Baget-55 to handle all of the information from the massive Zaslon-AM radar. This unit is a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar that actually consists of two distinct X- and L-band arrays working together. The original Zaslon, which the Soviet Union developed in the late 1970s specifically for the MiG-31, holds a number of firsts, both in that country and internationally. It was the first PESA ever installed in a fighter jet and was also the Soviet Union’s first look down/shoot down radar. The original Argon-15A fire control computer associated with the radar was also the first digital computer for an airplane that the Research Institute of Computer Engineering had ever developed. The MiG-31 series is the only aircraft to ever carry the Zaslon, as well as its improved variants. The first improved version, the Zaslon-M, which featured a larger overall antenna.  Together with an improved version of the Argon computer, it could reportedly track up to 24 different targets and engage up to four opponents simultaneously. The Zaslon-AM further improves upon this with the more powerful Baget-55 in place of the earlier Argon types. The video below describes many of the capabilities of the MiG-31’s Zaslon radar and associated fire control system. There are reports that even the improved Baget-55 may not have enough power to support the plane’s massive radar. One source told Baza that the pilots had been using an “experimental” mode of operation that involved repeatedly switching the radar on and off in a sort of manually pulsed mode to reduce the workload on the fire control computer. It is possible that this, or a severe lag in the processing of information, to begin with, might have prevented the system from recognizing the IFF signal properly. It might have also prevented that information appearing in a timely manner on the radar screens inside the cockpit. Baza says that the report it obtained does not offer any additional details in this regard. The Baget-55 may also limit the functionality of the MiG-31’s 8TK infrared search and track (IRST) system, which the plane has an alternate means of spotting and identifying targets. Baza ’s sources said that the IRST, another system with Soviet-era origins, is not 100 percent compatible with the new Baget-55 and, as a result, no longer has automated functionality. This all raises serious questions about the general capabilities of Russia’s premier long-range interceptor, which plays an extremely important role in defending large swaths of the country’s airspace. Its high speed and long range make it ideal for dashing to meet potential threats across Russia, including its most remote areas, such as the increasingly strategic Arctic region . The Zaslon-AM’s look down/shoot down capabilities, originally intended to spot and target low-flying American B-1 and B-52 bombers , means the planes also reportedly have the ability to shoot down low-flying cruise missiles, too. The improved MiG-31BM also has encrypted datalinks that allow it to share information from its powerful radar – when it’s working properly – with other aircraft and control centers on the ground. Of course, if these problems are not uncommon, it raises the question about why there has only been one actual incident of friendly fire, even just since the introduction of the Zaslon-AM on improved MiG-31BM aircraft four years ago. This could mean the issue may be linked more to exactly how the crew was operating the radar in this case, whether this was an “experimental” procedure or not. There is always the possibility that there have been other close calls that the Kremlin has kept hidden over the years, too. In this particular case in Siberia, the IFF system on the other MiG-31 may have been working, but also improperly configured for some reason and was sending out a code that would not register as friendly. The investigators might not have been able to confirm this depending on what they could recover from the crash and what other radar and IFF data was available to them after the incident. It’s also not clear why the two planes, had they been training together, would not have been aware of each other’s relative positions. It seems curious that the pilot in the aircraft that launched the missile would not have realized the “target” was exactly where their wingman should have been and that their companion was not on the radar at all. That a friendly aircraft was ever in the potential danger area during a live shoot certainly does call into question how the exercise was structured and whether the crews followed proper procedures, as the official investigation notes. If nothing else, the report, and Baza ‘s analysis of its contents , underscores just how much remains unknown about the incident. Key details about the entire chain of events are absent, including the relative ranges and altitudes of the two MiG-31s, what they expected the actual mock threat to look like, the rules of engagement for the live shoot, and any of the other specific exercise parameters. With this report out in the open now, more details may emerge in the future that will help further clarify what happened in the sky over Buryatia in 2017. But if the incident was a case of friendly fire, the Kremlin will continue to have incentives to withhold information that could not only be embarrassing, but that might call into question the capabilities of a central component of Russia’s air defense network.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 4, 2019",Rare and Historic Northrop Flying Wing Crashes Into Prison Yard In California (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but a privately owned Northrop N-9M crashed in Norco, California at around 12:10 PM local time. The condition of the pilot is unknown, but the aircraft itself sustained “substantial damage,” according to statements from the Federal Aviation Administration. The cause or causes of the crash are unknown, but the bright yellow flying wing came down inside the yard at the California Rehabilitation Center , a state prison facility. Though the condition of the pilot is unknown, the FAA and local authorities have said that there were no injuries on the ground as a result of the crash. “The circumstances are unknown,” the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office wrote in a Tweet. “The NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] will be conducting the investigation into the plane crash.” Video footage from news helicopters flying over the crash site an hour after the mishap shows little of the aircraft remaining intact. Unless there are larger parts we are not seeing, the plane appears to be a total loss. The crash is a major loss for aviation history. First flown in 1942, Northrop’s N-9M, with the “M” standing for “model,” was a test aircraft to support the development of the XB-35 and YB-35 prototype flying wing bombers. The N-9Ms had a 60-foot wing that was effectively a third-scale replica of the full-size bombers. This smaller surrogate design was made of both wood and metal and had a pair of engines driving pusher propellers, compared to the all-metal XB/YB-35 and its four pusher props. The N-9M was also an evolution of Jack Northrop’s earlier N-1M , which also supported the company’s flying wing work. Northrop built four N-9Ms, designating them N-9M-1, -2, A, and B. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. Air Force canceled the XB/YB-35 program, as well as the development of the improved YB-49 . Many of the airframes associated with these projects, including the first three N-9Ms, ended up being scrapped. Northrop, of course, never abandoned its interest in flying wing designs. Fly-by-wire technology eventually helped mitigate stability issues that made them hard to control. What had by then become Northrop Grumman finally realized the dream of the flying wing bomber when the B-2 Spirit entered U.S. Air Force service in 1997. The company is now in the process of developing its replacement, the B-21 Raider . Northrop Grumman has also used flying wings and other tailless planforms in the development of advanced drones, including prototype unmanned combat air vehicles, such as the X-47B . Other companies have also experimented with flying wings and similar designs, including on unmanned aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 . But evidence of this earlier work is more limited. Today, the lone N-1M is now in the collection at the National Air and Space Museum. The Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California bought the surviving N-9MB in 1982. A lengthy restoration process returned it to flying condition in 1993 and it had made regular appearances at the annual Chino airshow and other events since then. In 2006 , it suffered a mid-air engine fire, but was able to land safely. Planes of Fame again returned it to flying condition in 2010 and the plane was reportedly flying today in preparation for its next airshow appearance. Hopefully, the pilot is safe, but it’s sad to think that the historic flying wings that gave birth to the stealth bombers we know today will never be seen slicing through the air again. Update: 7:45pm EST— Sadly, the Riverside County Sheriff’s office has now described the incident as “fatal” in a Tweet. The social media post says that there is no confirmation on the number of occupants, but the N-9MB only has room for the pilot. Update: 5:10am PST— Here is the full statement from Planes Of Fame: April 22, 2019 Chino, CA Planes of Fame Air Museum: Today at approximately 12:00 PM one of our Museum pilots and our N9MB Northrop Flying Wing were lost in an accident in Norco, CA. The flight was being conducted in preparation for the upcoming Planes of Fame Airshow where it was scheduled to fly.  At this time details are not known as to the cause of the accident. The NTSB will investigate the accident to determine the cause. To our knowledge no one on the ground was injured nor was there damage to any buildings. The identification of the pilot, the sole occupant, is being withheld pending notification of family. The Planes of Fame N9MB, one of four one-third size flying wings built for flight testing in 1944, had been restored over a thirteen (13) year period beginning in 1981. The one of a kind aircraft flew its first post restoration flight on September 11, 1994 and had safely flown several hundred hours since then. We are deeply saddened by the loss of the pilot and our deepest sympathies go out to his family.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Oct 2, 2019",Bell Goes Low Risk And Low Cost With Armed Scout Based On 525 Relentless Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It had been something of a mystery what Bell would put forward for the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) tender, which aims at furnishing a high-speed and survivable helicopter capable of piercing enemy defenses over long distances. Now we have the answer, with Bell announcing that it will offer an airframe based on their 525 Relentless advanced passenger and utility helicopter. This is a big deal in that the 525 offers none of the exotic configurations of its competitors, like Sikorsky’s S-97 Raider , Airbus’ X3-based offering , and AVX’s concept , nor the second-generation tilt-rotor technology used on the company’s V-280 Valor demonstrator . Boeing could even roll out an Apache with a pusher propeller. Bell’s 525 is a ‘super’ medium-lift, twin-engine helicopter designed to haul up to 19 people out to oil rigs in a high-density cabin configuration or VIPs around in a very high-end cabin configuration. It is also suited for air ambulance and search and rescue work. The helicopter features a number of advances in its design and especially in terms of its fly-by-wire flight control system and advanced avionics that set a new bar for ease of helicopter piloting. The program has faced delays following a deadly crash in 2016 , but Bell plans to have the helicopter FAA certified sometime this year. You can read a bit more about the 525 in this past post of mine. Speed is the biggest issue with Bell’s 525-based offering. In order to meet baseline requirements for the FARA competition, the aircraft has to be able to sustain a speed of 200 knots, or about 230 miles per hour. Currently, the 525 can cruise at up to 160 knots, which is considerably fast, and has briefly hit speeds over 200 knots in testing. Bell thinks that some sort of variant that leverages the 525’s existing technologies can accomplish the 200 knot goal, which would be somewhat remarkable for a traditional helicopter configuration, especially because we are talking about a sustained speed here at operational weights, not a dash or a dive in a stripped-down airframe. Keep in mind that the world speed record for any conventional helicopter was made 33 years ago by a stripped down Westland Lynx that covered a 15km course at an average of 216 knots. So, we are talking about a much bigger engineering feat here than it sounds. It remains unclear how far Bell will go with the adapting the 525’s existing airframe or if they will repackage the 525’s tech and drivetrain into an entirely new airframe design. Scott Donnelly, CEO of Textron, which owns Bell stated the following according to Flight Global : “The technology that we invested – in terms of the rotor technology, the fly-by-wire systems, control systems – has enabled us to field a more conventional helicopter that has very high speed [and] very efficient, very smooth operating capability,” he says. The company will scale down the 525’s technology “to a size and weight that’s consistent with the FARA requirement”. 525 during testing., Zane Adams/wikicommons If Bell can pull this off, they could end up successfully positioning themselves as the lowest risk and lowest cost offering, and by a good margin. Depending on the timing, they could even win the competition out of necessity if defense budgets begin to head on a downward trend. And the stakes are very high. This aircraft is slated to replace roughly half of the Army’s AH-64 Apache fleet and would give Bell the mantle of purveyor of armed scout helicopters to the U.S. Army once again after it lost it when the Army made the very controversial decision to retire the entire OH-58D Kiowa Warrior fleet just a few years ago. That airframe was based on the iconic Bell Jet Ranger design. On the survivable end of the spectrum, speed is just one factor. Maybe Bell will repackage the 525’s tech into a stealthy airframe that goes a long way to reduce its radar and infrared signature. This is something that is much more challenging to do for designs that place a premium on high-speed. As a result, they may have bulky coaxial rotors and some sort of propulsor or propeller system that isn’t conducive to low-observability. Closeup of the 525 in action., Bell There is strong logic behind the idea that even though a rotary-wing platform may be as fast as feasible, if it can’t survive when it arrives over the battlespace, it is not worth much. If this is the case, Bell may have an incredibly convincing argument. Pack enough speed to shorten transit times and limit vulnerability over some areas where speed is beneficial, but concentrate on survivability over the combat zone without relying on nap-of-the-earth flying, electronic warfare, enhanced situational awareness systems , and active defensive systems alone. And possibly do all this at a price that is well within the Army’s ability to purchase large quantities relatively quickly. Currently, the Army says it wants to spend $30M on each armed scout aircraft. We know for a fact that Bell has worked for decades on low-observable helicopter applications. We also know that the precedent for a penetrating stealth helicopter being successfully used in a high-risk situation exists due to the Bin Laden raid . So, the possibility of a stealthy airframe here seems real. The design could even make use of new internal weapons deployment capabilities that are now available off-the-shelf and are uniquely conducive to stealth designs. , Bell At the same time, Bell could also aim to just attack on all fronts when it comes to driving down unit cost and present a non-stealthy design that meets the basic FARA requirements, but does so at a very attractive price and with very low risk to the Army. This could also help when it comes to exporting the next generation scout helicopter to allies around the globe, none of which have the dollars that the Pentagon does to blow on buying high-end platforms in large quantities. Either way, this is a novel strategy for Bell, but one that is also a bit of a gamble considering the competition is coming with some pretty high-end concepts that feature relatively extreme capabilities in the speed category. Also, the Army rejected a more conventional design, the MD 969 Swift , already, but that helicopter had no way of meeting the 200 knot requirement. Hopefully, we will get look at Bell’s final configuration soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 31, 2018",We Finally Know How Many F-22s Were Left Behind At Tyndall AFB During Hurricane Michael,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After weeks of rumor, hypothesis and raw speculation, we finally have metrics from an official source as to how many of Tyndall Air Force Base’s 55 F-22 Raptors were left behind as Hurricane Michael made a direct hit on the installation, leaving immense destruction in its wake . It turns out, our estimated figures and those from our sources that we conveyed very early on were exactly right. As reported by Military.com’s Oriana Pawlyk , a letter sent from Florida Senator Marco Rubio to Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson reads in part: “As you finalize damage assessments of the aircraft that endured Hurricane Michael, I urge you to begin implementation of the framework laid out by Secretary Mattis starting with all Tyndall AFB fighter aircraft… Additionally, I ask you waste no time or effort in providing a supplemental funding request to Congress to repair and restore these aircraft to mission capable status as soon as possible… As Hurricane Michael approached the Florida panhandle, 31 percent of F-22 aircraft at Tyndall Air Force Base were designated non-mission capable (NMC) and were sheltered in place.” So 17 of the Tyndall’s 55 Raptor’s were left to ride out the storm in hangars on the base. This matches what my sources initially conveyed to me going back to October 12th. See below: At the time, most people balked at the possibility of that number. So the next day I laid out in detail exactly why it is possible, if not probable. With 17 F-22 airframes left behind, the big question is how bad is the damage to each of those. In her report, Pawlyk mentions that five to seven temporary hangars are being constructed at Tyndall, with each being able to house two jets. In addition, the F-22s that have more superficial damage will be ferried to Langley AFB in Virginia to join the rest of the Tyndall Raptor fleet that originally escaped Michael by flying to Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio. Langley AFB is already a major F-22 operating location and will be the temporary home of the surviving Tyndall jets for the foreseeable future. Some of Tyndall’s F-22 that were left behind made it through the storm without catastrophic damage. , USAF Langley AFB Raptor pilots are currently ferrying the flyable F-22s from Tyndall to their Virginia base. , USAF Regardless of these details, a substantial part of the relatively small Raptor force is currently sidelined. And these jets are in addition to at least three others that suffered damage during landing mishaps in just this year alone. How all this will impact Raptor pilot and ground crew production, and the F-22 community’s overall mission as a whole, is yet to be seen. Finally, we still don’t know how many other types of aircraft have been lost or damaged. Numerous QF-16s and contractor Mu-2s were left at the base when the storm hit, and likely a number of T-38 Talons as well. We will continue to keep you in the loop as more details become available.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 10, 2018","Tyndall Air Force Base In Ruins After Michael, Fighter Jets Seen Inside Roofless Hangars","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday, we reported that Tyndall Air Force Base—the home of F-22 training and the USAF’s full-scale aerial target program—took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael , with its eye passing right overhead. Now we are seeing just how bad the damage is and it is downright horrific. Supposedly, the wind gauge on the base broke after winds hit 135 mph and are now thought to have reached above 150mph or even greater. A reevaluation of meteorological data from many sources could even result in Michael being retroactively reclassified from a category four to a category five hurricane . Official reports state that the damage done to the critical base is very widespread and severe, with virtually every structure on the installation having some level of roof damage, most of which is extreme. Water, sewer, and power are totally knocked out and will be for the foreseeable future. Maybe what’s most concerning is that it looks as if aircraft packed into the base’s large hangars were left open to the elements after their roofs were torn away during Michael’s onslaught. And all that debris went positively everywhere , turning pretty much any innocuous object into a missile. This Twitter video of a helicopter survey of the base shows just how bad the damage is (here is a direct link just in case the video doesn’t propagate below): Note that in the clip we see QF-16s and Mu-2s shoved into one another inside one of the base’s large and now roofless hangars. Many F-22s, T-38s, and QF-16s, as well as other aircraft that call the base home, were able to escape to areas unaffected by the storm, but some were also left behind because they were not capable of flight. Major damage to F-22s, which have become something akin to priceless treasures within the USAF due to the fact that only about 187 of them exist , in particular, would be most troubling. Three of the stealth super-fighters have already been damaged during landing incidents in just the last six months. With every F-22 sidelined, more pressure is put on the relatively tiny remaining force. You can see just how bad the roof damage was even to the base’s largest hangars in this photo as well: One of the most symbolic images of Michael has been that of one of Tyndall’s static display F-15s seen flipped entirely over and laying among a sea of debris. General Michael Holmes, the Commander of Air Combat Command, put out a video statement to Tyndall airmen on social media. He notes that the skeleton crew that was left behind at the base is accounted for and fine, which is great news, but he also makes it clear that the installation is badly damaged and personnel should stay away until further notice. The video is posted below and here is a direct link to it as well. A statement on Tyndall AFB’s Facebook page also reads: TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE 0600 UPDATE – Base leaders do not yet have an estimate of when Tyndall AFB will reopen. Base leaders are working with Air Force leadership to develop a short-term plan for our Airmen. Recovery teams have begun initial assessments of the base.

They found widespread roof damage to nearly every home. “At this point, Tyndall residents and evacuated personnel should remain at their safe location,” said Col. Brian Laidlaw, 325th Fighter Wing commander. “We are actively developing plans to reunite families and plan to provide safe passage back to base housing.” The evacuation order remains in effect for Tyndall. We will report back once we know more about the true extent of the damage to the base and to its highly prized flying residents.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 15, 2019",Russia’s New Surveillance Jet To Make First U.S. Visit To Photograph Military Bases,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is sending one of its two Tu-214ON observation aircraft the United States under the Open Skies Treaty, which gives signatories the opportunity to fly surveillance missions over each otherâ€™s territory, including the most sensitive of locales. Less than a month ago, an older Tu-154-ON aircraft flew a route that touched on , among other things, the secretive flight test facilities at Area 51 and the Nevada Test Site. The aircraft also made photo runs over many of America’s most important military installations in the Southwestern United States. However, the Tu-214-based planes have been a particular point of contention between the two countries and the U.S. government briefly refused to certify them as being compliant with the treatyâ€™s terms last year. The Tu-214ON is set to arrive at Rosecrans Air National Guard Base , which is attached to Rosecrans Memorial Airport in Saint Joseph, Missouri, on Apr. 22, according to an official statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense . The aircraft will conduct flights from that base through Apr. 27, 2019. The Kremlin did not specify what locations the plane would fly over and the U.S. government has not issued any statement of its own. â€œThe Russian aircraft will carry out the flight according to the route agreed with the observed party,â€ the Russian statement read . â€œU.S. experts on board will monitor the procedure for using the observation equipment and compliance with the provisions stipulated by the agreement.â€ Online flight tracking software showed one of the Tu-214ONs, with the registration number RF-64525, and using an Open Skies call sign, OSY332T, landing in Reykjavik, Iceland just after 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on Apr. 22, 2019. The aircraft took off again around 11:10 to continue its flight to Rosecrans.

The Kremlin says that the treaty mission will encompass a distance of no more than approximately 2,980 miles in total. From the base in Missouri, this would give the Tu-214ON the ability to fly routes that could touch on various significant U.S. military installations.Â The plane wouldn’t have to go very far to start surveilling very sensitive sites, though. Whiteman Air Force Base, home to the U.S. Air Force’s B-2A Spirit stealth bombers, is also in Missouri, situated around 100 miles to the southeast of Rosecrans. There are other strategic bomber bases well within range, too. Russia’s other Tu-214ON, registration RF 64519, in flight., Oleg Belyakov via Wikimedia Offutt Air Force Base in neighboring Nebraska could be another possibility. This base hosts U.S. Strategic Commandâ€™s headquarters, including a new command and control bunker, the U.S. Air Forceâ€™s 55th Wing, which controls the bulk of the serviceâ€™s RC-135 spy planes , as well as other specialized aircraft, such the E-4B Nightwatch â€œdoomsdayâ€ planes. Other locations of interest would be the intercontinental ballistic missile fields in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. But the Tu-214ON would also be within range of Texasâ€™ Fort Hood , one of the largest U.S. Army bases in the country. The plane would even be able to fly over the greater Washington, D.C. area . These are just a small few of the many possibilities. Much of the contiguous United States would be within the Tu-214ON’s range from Rosecrans. The central United States by itself is covered in numerous military facilities that the Kremlin could be interested in observing. This level of accessâ€”the ostensible goals of which are to promote transparency in military activities and reduce the likelihood of a dangerous misunderstandingâ€”has often been an issue in the United States. A number of members of Congress over the years have felt the agreement gives Russia outsized benefits , especially given the countryâ€™s limited satellite surveillance networks. Legislators, and senior U.S. military officials , have accused the Kremlin of abusing the treatyâ€™s parameters to gather more serious intelligence data about highly sensitive locations. You can read more about this ongoing controversy here . In recent years, the disputes had looked like they might completely upend the treaty. Since at least 2014 , the Tu-214ONs, which are derived from the Tu-204 airliner, have been a particularly pointed issue. The U.S. government’s official complaints centered on concerns about Russia’s plans to equip them with digital cameras, including infrared-capable ones, and that it could be considering added synthetic aperture radar to the plane’s sensor suite. A view of the underside of Tu-214ON, registration RF 64519, showing the various camera ports., Vitaly Kuzmin On Sept. 12, 2018, the United States went so far as to say it would refuse to certify the Tu-214ONs as treaty compliant, which would prevent them from flying any missions under the deal. This came right at the end of an extensive process to gain approval, which had begun after Russia first took delivery of the planes between December 2013 and July 2014. However, the exact rationale for this remains unclear. The annual defense policy bill for the 2019 Fiscal Year, which Donald Trump signed into law in August 2018, had blocked the U.S. government from spending any money in the upcoming fiscal cycle on certifying Russiaâ€™s Tu-214ONs, unless the executive branch meets certain requirements. However, Fiscal Year 2019 only began on Oct. 1, 2018. It’s also hard to see how the U.S. government’s stance could have actually been based on more technical considerations. The Tu-214ONs carry the exact same digital camera package that is on the latest iteration of the older Tu-154M-ON, which the U.S. government chose to certify without issue. The Kremlin long ago dropped plans to install a synthetic aperture radar capable of producing imagery, which had drawn particularly vocal protests from the United States, despite being allowed under the Open Skies Treaty. Thanks to the published specifications of their sensor, we know exactly how wide the swath of their imagery is. 2.7km, 7.7km, or 11.9km wide, depending on their altitude. Once you know the altitude and path, you know what is in frame, and you know what they took pictures of. pic.twitter.com/gRvxcga04v — Steffan Watkins î¨€ (@steffanwatkins) April 22, 2019 All Open Skies flights had already been on hold in 2018 due to an entirely separate dispute between Georgia and Russia . The U.S. Air Force did conduct a mission in December 2018 over Ukraine , but using a provision of the treaty that allows for extraordinary flights in certain circumstances. Russia’s older Tu-154M-ON., Dmitry Terekhov via Flickr Whatever the case, the U.S. government relented on Sept. 19, 2018, announcing it would certify the Russian plans by the end of the month. Georgia and Russia subsequently resolved their issues, and the Tu-214ONs have already begun flying. RF-64525 conducted a flight over Spain in March 2019 that included bases with a significant U.S. military presence, such as the U.S. Navy’s facilities in Rota. With U.S. relations with Russia at an all-time low, the final appearance of the Tu-214ON over American skies could reignite criticism within Congress of the Open Skies Treaty and prompt new efforts to pull the United States out of the deal. The state of major arm control deals involving the two countries is fragile, in general.Â Earlier in 2019, Russia formally announced it was suspending its participation in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . The United States had announced it was withdrawing from that landmark deal in 2018 over Russiaâ€™s fielding of a ground-launched cruise missile banned under that agreement. There are now serious questions about whether either party is interested in renewing the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START , which expires in 2021, unless both sides agree to renew it through 2026. A lot of the response from Capitol Hill will be dependent on exactly where the Tu-214ON ends up flying over in the coming days. The War Zone will certainly be keeping an eye on its moves to and from Rosecrans throughout the week.

The last of the U.S. Navy’s active duty P-3C Orion patrol planes are on their final overseas deployments, split between bases in Bahrain and Japan. The six-month rotations in the Middle East and Pacific regions come as the service prepares to retire all of its Orions in active duty units and replace them completely with the new P-8A Poseidon . The Whidbey News-Times was the first to report that P-3Cs from Patrol Squadron Four Zero (VP-40), the “Fighting Marlins,” left their main base at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island in Washington state at the end of March 2019 for their sundown deployments to Sheik Isa Air Base in Bahrain and Kadena Air Base in Japan. These Orions replaced their counterparts from Patrol Squadron Four Six (VP-46), the “Grey Knights,” at those locations. VP-46’s planes returned to Whidbey Island earlier in April 2019 . VP-46 had also deployed P-3Cs to Europe, but VP-40 did not send any of its aircraft to that region, according to reports. VP-46 is now set to enter a six-month transition period to switch over to the new P-8A. VP-40 will do the same after it returns to Whidbey Island.

The planes at Kadena, situated on the island of Okinawa, will be flying many of the same missions in the western Pacific and may find themselves tasked to help keep an eye out for North Korean ships looking to circumvent international sanctions . You can read more about the kind of missions that Navy patrol squadrons undertake here . “We could not be more proud of the effort given by the men and women of VP-40,” U.S. Navy Commander Patrick O’Reilly, the unit’s commanding officer, told the Whidbey News-Times . “Even when the aircraft fought against us, even when the tempo was high and the days were long, we continued to fight.” A Navy sailor signals to one of VP-40’s P-3Cs ahead of its departure as part of the squadron’s final deployment., USN O’Reilly was referring to a 12-month readiness cycle to get the unit prepared for its final deployment. His comments also speak to the increasing difficulties in sustaining the aging P-3Cs at a time in which U.S. military aviation communities have already found themselves under considerable strain to meet readiness goals . The Navy introduced the P-3A , originally known as the P3V-1, in 1962. The P-3C model began entering service in 1969 and subsequently went through a number of major upgrade programs. VP-40 first began flying the Orion in 1967, transitioning at the time from the SP-5B Marlin flying boat. One of VP-40’s SP-5B Marlin flying boats conducting a rocket-assisted take off from Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam in 1967., USN VP-40’s SP-5Bs had already been flying combat operations off the coast of Vietnam and its P-3s continued serving in that theater in the 1970s. Some of unit’s Orions also took part in the search for survivors from a Navy EC-121M Warning Star intelligence gathering aircraft that North Korean fighter jets shot down in 1969 . The squadron also supported the search and rescue effort after Soviet fighter jets shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983. Eight years later, they supported Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf region, flying marathon missions from Diego Garcia thousands of miles away in the Indian Ocean. Since then, the squadron’s P-3Cs have flown various anti-submarine, search and rescue, counter-drug, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. VP-40 has also taken part in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, including ISR sorties employing aircraft equipped with Raytheon’s highly capable AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS). A P-3C equipped with the LSRS pod underneath., USAF After this deployment and the subsequent transition period, VP-40 is set to continue performing this same general set of missions with the much more capable P-8A, which first entered Navy service in 2013. These aircraft have been steadily replacing P-3Cs across the service. The last active-duty Orion squadron based on the East Coast, Patrol Squadron Two Six (VP-26), the “Tridents,” began their final deployment in 2015 and transitioned to the Poseidon the following year. It is important to note that VP-40 and VP-46’s P-3Cs aren’t the only aircraft of this general type still in active-duty Navy service. The service’s highly secretive Patrol Squadron Special Projects Unit Two (VPU-2), the “Wizards,” is still flying a number of P-3Cs equipped with a variety of specialized intelligence-gathering equipment. These aircraft are distinct from the Navy’s fleet of EP-3E Aeries II signals intelligence aircraft, which are converted P-3Cs, and that are also set to remain in service for some time longer. An EP-3E Aeries II., USN In September 2018, the Navy announced it would establish Fleet Support Unit One at NAS Jacksonville in Florida to replace VPU-2. This new unit “will configure and operate P-8 aircraft to provide follow-on special mission capability in place of projects patrol squadron (VPU) P-3 aircraft due to sundown in 2019,” according to an official notice . Replacing the “special projects” P-3s with the P-8A makes good sense since the Posiedons already has significant electronic and signals intelligence capabilities , to begin with. Even after VP-40 and VPU-2 trade in their last P-3Cs, two Navy Reserve patrol squadrons will also still be flying Orions. These are Patrol Squadron Six Two (VP-62), the “Broadswords,” at Jacksonville, and Patrol Squadron Six Nine (VP-69), the “Totems,” at Whidbey Island. The Navy expects to retire the very last P-3C from service in 2023. A P-8A, at left, flies with a P-3C., USN Still, VP-40’s final deployments certainly mark the beginning of the end of an era for U.S. naval aviation. When the last Orions head off for their well-deserved retirement in four years, variants of aircraft will have been in Navy service for more than six decades.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Within the last two days, Kim Jong Un has been present at two publicized military engagements, something we haven’t seen since the darkest days of U.S-North Korean tensions that led up to a spate of detente that lasted just over a year. This warming of relations culminated in the collapsed denuclearization talks between the U.S. and North Korea in Hanoi late last February. Meanwhile, Kim is looking toward Moscow for closer relations and what may become a lifeline from the hardline international sanctions that are stifling North Korea’s economic growth. Kim visited Sunchon Air Base on Tuesday, February 16th, 2019, to inspect operations there. The base is tasked with protecting Pyongyang from aerial attack and houses the country’s most advanced fighter aircraft, aging MiG-29s Fulcrums, as well as Su-25 Frogfoot close air support aircraft. Kim had visited the base fairly frequently in years past. State media reported that the North Korean dictator gave his usual ‘field guidance’ and sent the aircraft scrambling to perform takeoff and landing drills (a worthless mini airshow). It also quoted him as stating the following: “The air of peace that has arrived on the Korean Peninsula is not stable, nor have the aggressions of the hostile forces disappeared… Only a strong military can guarantee peace.” North Korea State Media North Korea State Media North Korea State Media North Korea State Media North Korea State Media North Korea State Media Then, on Wednesday, April 17th, 2019, North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un oversaw the test of a “new tactical guided weapon.” No pictures of that test have been provided and it is unclear exactly what type of system was tested, although it could be as simple as an anti-tank or surface-to-air missile. But that’s not really the point. The messaging is clear—North Korea wants to make it known that their old militaristic modus operandi can quickly return and that this is just a taste of old status quo that deeply rattled the U.S., South Korea, and Japan from 2016 to 2017. A near-identical statement about a tactical weapon test occurred last November , during a time when diplomatic efforts with the U.S. seemed to be stalling. At the time, that was the first publicized military engagement Kim attended in nearly a year. Now, as prospects of a U.S.-North Korea deal and the lifting of some sanctions on Pyongyang have all but dematerialized, we are getting back-to-back military engagements from Kim, and those engagements seem uniquely pointed—visiting the top air combat unit in the country and ‘testing’ a new missile of some sort. The latter of which is clearly meant to jog the memories of the U.S. and its allies of the constant missile tests that put the entire region on edge. Kim addressing the rubber-stamp party assembly in Pyonyang. , AP/NK State Media The optics of Kim Jong Un’s activities are one thing, but a much larger geopolitical development for North Korea is likely imminent, one many of us saw coming from miles away. By most accounts, Kim is set to make his first visit to Russia very soon, where he will meet with President Vladimir Putin. The location for the meeting is likely nearby Vladivostok, which is already the central hub of North Korean-Russian trade. With Russia being a key player in the sanctions that are crippling North Korea’s economy, closer ties with Moscow can only help Kim’s situation. But there is the possibility that Moscow could do more than just be a more understanding international power broker. For Putin, the vacuum created by the collapse in U.S.-North Korean talks could offer a unique opportunity. If Moscow were to drastically increase its involvement with Pyongyang on a trade and national security level, it could strengthen Kim and his regime, while also broadening Russia’s influence in a very important region. Russia could use corporate proxies and the black market to subvert the same sanctions regime on North Korea it has signed off on. It’s not as if Russia has been enforcing those sanctions to a high degree already. In fact, quite the opposite seems true. Russia is also already laying the groundwork for increased trade with North Korea via exploiting loopholes in the sanctions regime that would make such economic participation compliant with those accords. A cross-border bridge is also being discussed and North Korea is asking Moscow not to send home its laborers in accordance with the sanctions. The exportation of labor is a major currency source for the Kim Regime. North Korea also wants Russian airliners to revitalize its rickety state-run airline fleet. A year ago, Foreign Minister Lavrov visited Pyongyang for the highest-level Russian-North Korean diplomatic exchange of Kim’s rule: https://youtube.com/watch?v=qdblKaX960I Some worry that an invigorated Russian relationship with North Korea could eventually lead to security guarantees and even a rearming of North Korea’s military. Russia has certainly shown its willingness to back nefarious allies with direct military support when favorable regimes are threatened and these examples haven’t even been for countries located near Russian borders. Such an arrangement would drastically increase the complexity of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. There is also a high possibility that Russia will attempt position itself as a peacemaker between North Korea and the U.S. in an effort to raise its profile as an international power broker and to fortify its narrative that it is the level-headed player on the international stage that can rein-in America’s aggressive foreign policy. Such a move could also set a pretext for a weak disarmament deal proposition that would give Russia a reason to push for an end to sanctions on North Korea whether the U.S. goes along with it or not. As for the possibility of a third summit between Kim and Trump, both leaders have floated the possibility, but it seems Kim is positioning himself very much in the driver’s seat, stating: “If the U.S. adopts a correct posture and comes forward for the third DPRK-U.S. summit with a certain methodology that can be shared with us, we can think of holding one more talks… Anyway, we will wait for a bold decision from the U.S. with patience till the end of this year, but I think it will definitely be difficult to get such a good opportunity as the previous summit. What is clear is that if the U.S. persists in its present political calculation method, the prospect of settling the issues will be gloomy and very dangerous… Self-reliant national defense capabilities constitute a powerful treasured sword for defending the sovereignty of the country… We have to always keep in mind that peace can be ensured only by powerful military capabilities, and firmly maintain the principle of self-defense and keep increasing the defense capabilities of the country.” The Trump Administration says it needs to see signs that North Korea is serious about denuclearization before another summit takes place. At the same time, Trump continues to praise the North Korean dictator and states his relationship with him is excellent. He also says he would like a big deal that would lead to denuclearization and would meet again if that was possible. In the meantime, North Korea is armed with dozens of nuclear weapons and has long-range delivery systems that could threaten the United States. Those programs have continued to evolve over the last year. The U.S. and South Korea have drastically curtailed their war games and large force training exercises and Seoul continues to hope it can proceed with thawing relations with the North. With all this in mind, the big question is where does this leave North Korea’s nuclear status? Are the U.S. and South Korea at the point where tacit acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state seems likely if not inevitable? What would happen if the ballistic missile tests start up again? If the unstated policy of the Trump Administration is that that North Korea can continue on its nuclear path as long as they don’t test a warhead or a ballistic missile, will North Korea take advantage of that opportunity and continue its moratorium on tests even as sanctions continue to hamper the country’s economic development? The North Koreans are fully aware that the restarting of provocative missile tests would be troublesome for the Trump Administration in an election year. So, at this point, it’s very possible that Kim will hold back on testing for the year to see if a third summit materializes that has sanctions relief on the table without having to give up anything substantial in terms of his nuclear deterrent in exchange. This would also match his statement above. After that, all bets are off.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 10, 2019",More Than A Dozen Air Force KC-135s and KC-46s Flee Kansas Base Ahead Of Bad Weather,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has ordered 13 aerial refueling tankers, 10 KC-135s and three of the service’s new KC-46 Pegasuses , to evacuate McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas amid concerns about severe weather approaching the area. The precautionary moves follow a number of high-profile weather-related disasters that have impacted major Air Force Bases in the past few months, including severe flooding that inundated Offutt Air Force Base in neighboring Nebraska in March, causing significant damage. Officials at McConnell announced the evacuation on Apr. 17, 2019 and said that the tankers would move to Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington state, which is a designated “safe haven” that has the necessary space and facilities to support the displaced aircraft and supporting personnel. There are no plans to close McConnell, which is home to the 22nd Aerial Refueling Wing, the Air Force’s largest tanker wing, entirely, though. KCWH , a local CBS affiliate in Wichita, Kansas, where McConnell is situated, reported that chances of a tornado touching down were low, but that there was a high probability of high winds and hail, both of which can be threatening to aircraft in the open. Wind can also be an issue for aircraft that cannot fit completely and securely inside of available hangars. A KC-135 departs McConnell Air Force Base on Apr. 17, 2019., USAF A tornado at Offutt in 2017 damaged two E-4B Nightwatch “doomsday” planes, which had their tails exposed. The severe winds turned the tails into sails, smacking the two planes together and causing millions in damage . The storm also caused damage to eight RC-135 spy planes. Evacuations in the face of severe weather, when possible , are hardly rare, but the past six months have been particularly hard on the Air Force when it comes to storm-related damage. In March 2019, heavy rains also melted snow in much of the midwest, causing historic flooding, which put a significant portion of Offutt Air Force Base under water . The strategic base is home to the bulk of the service’s RC-135 spy planes and other low-density, high-value assets, such as the E-4Bs. It also hosts the headquarters of U.S. Strategic Command, which is in charge of America’s nuclear deterrent forces, among other things, and there were concerns that a new hardened bunker on the base would be at risk from the flooding. A scene from Offutt Air Force Base in March 2019. One of the Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch aircraft, of which it has just four in total, is visible in the background., USAF This disaster came nearly six months after Hurricane Michael ran right over Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, leaving it devastated. The Air Force is still working on returning that base to its previous operating status. In the meantime, the service is now proposing to move the F-22 Raptor stealth fighters that were at the base permanently to other locations, including Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. The Air Force has already asked for $350 million in additional funds to cover clean up and basic repairs, but it will need billions in total over the coming years to fully restore the base. In March 2019, the service asked Congress for nearly $5 billion in total supplemental funds through the 2021 Fiscal Year to cover repairs at both that base and Tyndall. Keeping the KC-46s safe is undoubtedly of particular importance to the Air Force. McConnell’s 22nd Aerial Refueling Wing became the first unit to receive the Pegasus in January 2019, a major milestone in the tanker’s troubled development, which you can read about in more detail here . The program has continued to struggle since then and the Air Force has had to stop accepting any more aircraft from planemaker Boeing twice this year already due to quality control issues. As of Apr. 9, 2019, the service was still not taking deliveries of additional KC-46s and didn’t expect to start doing so again until Apr. 23, 2019. In addition, though the 22nd Aerial Refueling Wing is officially part of Air Mobility Command, the unit is an important part of America’s Nuclear Triad , with one of its key missions being to support Air Force Global Strike Command’s B-52 and  B-2 bombers during a nuclear strike . It is therefore essential for the Wing to ensure that an adequate number of its KC-135s are ready and available to perform this mission at all times. These kinds of evacuations may become more common in the future. Pentagon is concerned that flooding and other severe weather may increasingly pose a risk to its facilities due to global climate change. In January 2019, the Defense Department sent a report to members of Congress that, among other things, noted that 53 of 79 bases deemed especially critical were in danger of increasingly recurrent flooding. McConnell’s announcement about this latest evacuation says “aircraft and personnel impacted by the evacuation will return when it is safe to do so.” Hopefully, the storms will pass through with little if any damage and the 22nd’s tankers can return home quickly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 8, 2019",New MD Explorer Gunship Features Internal Tubes For Launching Guided Munitions And Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just a little over a month after MD Helicopters unveiled its latest armed helicopter, the MD 969, the company has revealed a new option for the chopper, a seven-round launcher that sits inside the main cabin and pops precision-guided munitions out through a hatch in the rear of the fuselage. The system uses the increasingly popular Common Launch Tube , or CLT, which can already accommodate a wide variety of payloads, including small drones . The Arizona-headquartered helicopter maker debuted the weapon system, which it says CLT-maker Sistema Technologies custom designed for the MD 969, at the Army Aviation Association of America’s 2019 Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit on Apr. 14, 2019 . The company had only shown the MD 969 to the public for the first time at the HAI Heli-Expo on Mar. 5, 2019 . “Powerful, agile and elegant, the MD 969 is first and foremost an advanced twin-engine light attack helicopter that delivers impressive endurance, speed, maneuverability, and unmatched safety,” Lynn Tilton, MD Helicopter’s CEO, said in a press release . “With the integration of this innovative and adaptable Common Launch Tube System – a capability not currently offered on any light attack helicopter – the MD 969 will be a true force multiplier; creating the performance and capability benchmark for future twin-engine light attack helicopter advancements.” The cabin-mounted CLT weapon system for the MD 969., MD Helicopters The MD 969 is the latest variant in the company’s MD 900-series , also known Explorer series, which what was then McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems first introduced in the early 1990s. The twin-engine Explorers are larger and more powerful than the company’s better-known MD 500-series helicopters , more commonly known as Little Birds . It is worth noting that MD Helicopters already offers Little Birds with Dillon Aero’s six-position Mission Configurable Aircraft System (MCAS), which can also accommodate CLTs, but the CLT launcher for the MD 969 offers this capability without sacrificing space for other stores on its stub wings. Having the system mounted in the helicopter’s main cabin potentially means it could be reloadable in the flight, too. Of course, extra loaded tubes would also limit the space available inside for other systems. The configuration MD Helicopters put on display at the Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit had tubes marked as if they were loaded with seven of Raytheon’s AGM-176 Griffins . These weapons can function as powered missiles or unpowered glide bombs and feature a multi-mode guidance system that can either home in on a laser spot or use its GPS-assisted Inertial Navigation System to hit a specific set of coordinates. This gives it the ability to engage moving vehicles or strike fixed targets, even in poor weather. Griffin is just one option, though. Elements of the U.S. military, including U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the U.S. Marine Corps, also employ CLTs loaded with the GBU-44/B Viper Strike glide bomb for multiple different launch platforms. AFSOC has also begun using CLT-launched GBU-69/B Small Glide Munitions (SGM), something that recently made international news as part of an Amnesty International investigation into civilian casualties that American air strikes may have caused in Somalia in recent years. But Sistema has been offering these tubes as a common launch mechanism for various payloads from both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, including drones, for nearly a decade. The company has qualified other munitions in the CLT, including Textron’s G-CLAW miniature multi-mode glide-bomb. It has also demonstrated that the tube can serve as a way for aircraft to deploy small drones , such as Raytheon’s Coyote , in mid-air. MD Helicopters’ specifically noted this latter capability in announcing the new CLT weapon system. The MD 969 will be able to deploy unmanned aircraft “provide increased situational awareness for both ground and air-based warfighters” and that this “will be a game-changer for light attack helicopter operations,” according to the company’s press release . The new precision-guided munitions launcher is only one part of the MD 969’s arsenal, too. MD Helicopters had initially shown the design with stub wings, each with up to three hard points. These can accommodate a wide variety of weapons, including gun pods, unguided and guided 70mm rockets, and guided missiles, such as the AGM-114 Hellfire . The chopper has a sensor turret under the nose with a mix of electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. Otherwise, the MD 969 leverages much of the design from the established Explorer series. Though MD Helicopters had pitched a militarized Combat Explorer variant in the past, the MD 900-series has enjoyed sales primarily with police, air ambulance services, and companies offering VIP transport services. The Combat Explorer demonstrator., MD Helicopters The U.S. Coast Guard did briefly operate a pair of the helicopters, designated the MH-90 , with door-mounted weapons. The Mexican Navy does fly Explorers with forward-firing machine guns and rockets. As with all the other variants of the Explorer, the MD 969 uses MD Helicopter’s No Tail Rotor (NOTAR) system, which leverages vectored thrust from the main engines rather than a tail rotor to counter the torque of the main rotor. The proprietary NOTAR arrangement allows for quieter operation, eliminates the danger of the tail rotor hitting something during low-level flight, and reduces the overall size of the helicopter’s tail, which can be valuable for operating in constrained spaces. The light attack helicopter also features a number of general improvements over the earlier 900-series models. This includes a modular, open-architecture glass cockpit that is customizable to meet customer demands and can readily accept upgrades and improvements in the future. MD Helicopters had also been working on a high-speed derivative, called the Swift , to meet the demands of the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program. However, the service rejected that proposal . You can read about the Army’s program, which is looking for a high-speed, long-range rotorcraft, in greater depth here . Still, the MD 969 offers impressive capabilities for a helicopter of its size. The CLT weapon system now leaves the door wide open for the rapid integration of new munitions and payloads in the future, as well. Of course, while Sistema made this specific weapon system custom for MD Helicopters, it would not be surprising to see CLT launchers as an option on an increasing number of helicopters, as well as fixed-wing aircraft, as time goes on for the same reason. Bell has already shown concept art of its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor equipped with nine-round side-mounted munitions launcher that also appears to use the CLT. A similar weapon system would be a relatively simple way to increase the capability of other modular and adapted gunship platforms, too. An artist’s conception of an armed version of the Bell V-280 Valor, including forward-firing missiles and a side-mounted, nine-round munitions launcher., Bell Right now, though, the weapon system definitely helps MD Helicopter’s latest light attack chopper stand out from its competitors.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 5, 2019",Lockheed Tests Game-Changing F-35-Like X-Ray Vision System On Bell’s V-280 Valor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has flown its new Pilotage Distributed Aperture Sensor, or PDAS, on Bell’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor aircraft for the first time. This system uses multiple cameras to offer pilots a 360-degree view around their aircraft, similar to the Distributed Aperture System on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. This is a game-changing capability that could improve their ability to avoid threats, navigate more safely, even at night and in other poor visibility conditions, and simply have better situational awareness overall during flight. The modular technology could have applications far beyond tilt-rotors and other rotorcraft, including fixed-wing aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles , and might find uses in the commercial sector, too. On Apr. 15, 2019 , the Maryland headquartered defense contractor revealed that it had conducted the PDAS tests on the prototype V-280 in a series of flights from its facilities in Fort Worth, Texas the month before. Lockheed Martin says it signed a deal with Bell in 2013 to test the system on their tilt-rotor and began working on it actively in 2014 . The company has previously tested it on board a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, as well. “Conducting PDAS flight tests on the V-280 is an exciting first step toward delivering a level of situational awareness unavailable on today’s Army rotorcraft,” Rita Flaherty, the Strategy and Business Development Vice President at Lockheed Martin’s Missiles and Fire Control division, said in a press release . “With its embedded, multi-functional sensors, PDAS is the ideal foundation for an integrated survivability suite that will enable Army aircrews to own any environment and universally detect and defeat incoming threats.” The PDAS configuration on the V-280 consists of six infrared cameras positioned around the aircraft. A central processing system “stitches together” these feeds and then pump them into helmet-mounted displays for the pilot and co-pilot, as well as fixed screens in the cockpit. The result is that pilots can “see” in any direction, including what would otherwise be blind spots, such as through the floor or straight to the rear of the aircraft. This is similar in general principle to how the Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS) works on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The DAS similarly gives pilots in these stealthy fighter jets a panoptic view in any direction. Lockheed Martin’s PDAS presents a simpler, less deeply integrated option that is more applicable to helicopters and tilt-rotors, such as the V-280. The company started development of the system as something that could eventually work its way into the Army’s Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration, which is supposed to lead into parts of the larger Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. A closer look at one of the PDAS’ sensors on the V-280., Lockheed Martin FVL’s objective is to develop replacements for all of the Army’s existing helicopters, which could also supplant other rotorcraft in service across the U.S. military. As part of the JMR effort, the V-280 will take part in a series of evaluations alongside the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter from Boeing and Sikorsky. Lockheed Martin bought Sikorsky in 2015, after work on the PDAS for Bell’s V-280 began. The Army has tied both JMR and FVL to a variety of other tertiary efforts to develop advanced capabilities that are modular and adaptable to whatever design it might choose. PDAS is one of these related developments and one that could be especially revolutionary. The video below includes clips from Lockheed Martin’s test of the PDAS-equipped V-280 in March 2019. On its website , Lockheed Martin likens PDAS to the introduction of the Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (TADS/PNVS) on the AH-64 Apache gunship . This nose-mounted sensor turret, which the Army has since replaced with the Modernized TADS/PNVS , offered then state-of-the-art capabilities that allowed crews to navigate and target opponents like never before at night. The service also coupled it with a helmet-mounted monocle that could both cue the sensors and display the feed right in front of the pilot’s eye. Many helicopters now have their own sensor turrets to allow for improved target acquisition and navigation at night, during poor weather, in when operating in environments full of smoke, dust, or other obscurants. The Army itself has been working separately on a Degraded Vision Environment-Mitigation (DVE-M) camera system for its existing helicopters to make it easier and safer for them to operate in these conditions. However, the majority of these systems generally offer a limited “soda straw” view in only one direction at a time. At night, aviators also use night vision goggles to provide additional situational awareness, but these also typically have a relatively narrow field of view. Even advanced systems coupled with helmet-mounted displays, such as t Apache’s TADS/NVDS, are still uni-directional, even though they do allow the crew to rapidly shift focus from a single area to another. In contrast, PDAS gives pilots the ability to shift attention from one area of interest to another without having to slew a sensor turret, or physically move the aircraft into a more optimal position, at all. With this system, crew members can also look in different directions independently at once. This means they can more rapidly identify targets or threats, including things such as incoming missiles. It also offers the possibility that the crew may be able to more readily spot and avoid hazards altogether and could make formation flying safer. PDAS’ situational awareness is also important just for basic navigation, especially at night and when flying low-level nap-of-the-earth flight profiles. At low altitudes and high speeds, helicopters and other rotorcraft as particularly vulnerable to a host of general environmental hazards, including power lines . These risks only go up after dark or when various visual obscurants are present, all of which can cause sudden and dangerous losses of situational awareness. This could also help during missions that require helicopters and other rotorcraft to hold a steady hover for a protracted period of time, while also winching personnel or other cargo up and down, such as combat search and rescue or disaster relief. These operations can often occur in areas where there is limited room to maneuver, requiring the entire crew to be constantly aware of their position. The same goes for trying to land or insert personnel into very tight spots . https://youtube.com/watch?v=kOOAoM5pFGA Lockheed Martin has also designed the PDAS to readily accept upgrades to add more features in the future, too. The hope is that a single system could provide enough processing power to pump feeds into up to six helmets on a single helicopter or tilt-rotor. This means door gunners or other personnel would have the same augmented vision, provide even greater situational awareness for the crew and their passengers, as a whole. Together with what the company calls Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion (MMSF), PDAS could eventually overlay information from other sensors to provide an even more comprehensive picture with a symbology that identifies friendly forces, threats, and other objects of interest. Information from multiple sensors would also help mitigate a failure of any one particular system, either from hostile attacks or general malfunctions. For instance, Lockheed Martin says that terrain-following and terrain-recognition capabilities could provide an important, accurate navigation capability even in an instance where an opponent is jamming GPS signals, something that is becoming an increasingly realistic threat on the battlefield. Sikorsky has also been working separately with the Army and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a “digital co-pilot” system that can use a series of cameras and other sensors fly a helicopter autonomously, if necessary. You can read more about this program, known as the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS), which aims to help aircrews perform a wide array of tasks more safely and efficiently, here . An infographic describing the general capabilities that Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion has to offer., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin says it expects to demonstrate PDAS on an M-model Black Hawk helicopter for an unspecified “special customer” this summer, too, according to Defense News . This could very well be Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , which operates almost exclusively at night and in challenging and unusual environments where the added situational awareness the system offers could be particularly useful. But the value of the capabilities PDAS has to offer is hardly limited to helicopters and other rotorcraft. It could be adaptable to various fixed-wing aircraft, such as cargo planes and aerial refueling tankers , that might not need something as robust as the F-35’s DAS, but still have requirements to operate at night and in other visually degraded environments where improved situational awareness could be extremely valuable. It could also be a revolutionary upgrade for flying unmanned aircraft remotely. At present, drone operators have extremely limited situational awareness since the only way they can “see” what’s around the aircraft is to use its onboard sensors. PDAS would give these remote pilots not only a virtual cockpit, but one with completely unrestricted vision. Even with future fully autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , a physical individual could use this system to monitor the drone’s progress and then take control directly if necessary. It could be especially useful for using advanced drone for more complex missions, such as close air support, that would benefit from a man-in-the-loop control with high situational awareness. Of course, all this is limited by communications bandwidth capable of pumping out so much data beyond line-of-sight. An advanced flight simulator with a hemispheric screen, such as the one seen above, might double a remote cockpit for a drone in the future using imagery provided by PDAS., USAF Systems such as PDAS offer many of the same advantages to the crews of ships and ground vehicles, as well. This would similarly apply to manned and unmanned platforms, too. For example, the existing electro-optical and infrared camera systems on ships have similar limitations to sensor turrets on aircraft. In some cases, the maritime systems are virtually identical to their aerial counterparts. PDAS, or a system like it, would let the crew on a ship “see” through the hull or personnel inside an armored vehicle “look” straight through the hull. In a maritime setting, this could make it easier to spot smaller threats, such as swarming of suicide boats very low to the waterline, or environmental hazards, such as shallow rock outcroppings. Northrop Grumman has already been working on a navalized version of the AN/AAQ-37, known as Silent Watch . For ground vehicles, it would mean being able to maintain full situational awareness even “buttoned up” with all the hatches closed, offering maximum protection against the enemy. Historically, this has meant severely limiting the vision of the vehicle’s occupants, which could open up blind spots to attack, especially in dense urban areas where hostile forces can easily pop out from behind cover, engage their targets, and then rapidly withdraw to safety. In 2018, Israeli defense contractor Elbit unveiled Iron Vision , an augmented reality vision system for armored vehicles. Rafael, another Israeli firm, is also now pitching its own suite of networked sensors , claiming it can readily adapt the modular system to different vehicles. The advantages of a distributed vision system such as PDAS are readily applicable to various commercial sectors, as well. On the aviation side, aerial fire fighting helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft would be among the most immediate beneficiaries of an augmented vision system. These fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, by definition, are flying at low level in areas full of smoke that can be dense enough to limit visibility and the amount of natural light available during the day. Again, the potential risks only increase after dark, which has led many jurisdictions to severely limit nighttime aerial firefighting operations. PDAS or an equivalent could make it safer and easier for aerial firefighting aircraft to conduct their missions, especially at night, when temperatures drop, humidity goes up, and winds often die down, making it an optimal time for water bombing sorties. The video below looks at testing in Australia in 2018 to validate night aerial firefighting capabilities, which explores many of these issues in more detail. As seen in the video above, night vision goggles are the primary means of enabling nighttime aerial firefighting operations now. The same goes for many police helicopters , air ambulances , and other aircraft supporting first responders after dark. Sensor turrets are becoming more commonplace, but still have the limitations discussed earlier. All of these aircraft could benefit from something such as PDAS, especially if they have to weave through dense urban environments. Civilian agencies and contractors flying in humanitarian assistance in the wake of a major disaster or other crisis would definitely appreciate the added situational awareness. It could be invaluable in cases where existing airfield lighting and other infrastructure might be severely damaged, if it wasn’t very limited, to begin with. A number of private companies are looking at ways to make inter-city air travel a more practical and affordable option in the future. Again, augmented vision systems could help make these activities safer and ease the minds of air traffic regulators worried about increased congestion in already tightly packed urban environments and other safety issues. As is the case on the military side, the capabilities PDAS offers for aircraft would just as easily translate to commercial shipping and could have benefits on the ground, as well, especially for first responders. There are relatively few scenarios in which the ability to more rapidly assess the situation and identify objects of interest and potential hazards faster is not valuable. PDAS in its current state isn’t necessarily suited to all of these roles, but it could serve as a stepping stone to a broader family of technologies and systems. PDAS’ easily reconfigurable and upgradeable design certainly offers a clear path to adding in new functionalities down the road. With all this in mind, PDAS certainly looks set to offer revolutionary capabilities not only in the air, but at sea and on the ground in the future Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 19, 2019",German and Canadian Firms Developing SeaSpider Rocket-Powered Anti-Torpedo Torpedo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. German and Canadian defense contractors are moving ahead with the development of a rocket-powered hard-kill anti-torpedo defense system called SeaSpider that they hope could become a standard feature on naval vessels in both of those countries . The project is another example of growing interest around the world in anti-torpedo torpedoes to defeat increasingly advanced threats . The War Zone has been closely following the U.S. Navy’s own effort , which you can read about in depth in a recent feature . On Apr. 12, 2019 , Canada’s Magellan Aerospace Corporation announced it had entered into a partnership with Atlas Elektronik Canada, a subsidiary of Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, to continue design and development of SeaSpider . This came just days after it emerged that German Armed Forces’ Technical Center for Ships and Naval Weapons and Maritime Technology and Research, also known as WTD71, had conducted sea trials of the anti-torpedo torpedo system using the German Navy’s Schwedeneck -class test ship Helmsand between 2017 and 2018. Magellan Aerospace and Atlas Elektronik have been working together on parts of the system since 2016 , when Magellan first agreed to provide the rocket motor and warhead section for the interceptor. “The partnership between Atlas and Magellan will bring to market an innovative new torpedo defense system that will be the first of its kind in this growing market segment,” Haydn Martin, Magellan Aerospace’s Vice President for Business Development, Marketing and Contracts, said in a press release . “We welcome the opportunity to collaborate in this exciting new endeavor with Atlas Elektronik.” For surface ships, the complete SeaSpider system consists of one or more launchers with multiple interceptors, each packed inside their own self-contained canister, and a passive towed sonar. There is also a centralized control system capable of classifying and localizing incoming threats, cueing the anti-torpedo torpedo, and launching it to intercept the target. An overview of the components of the SeaSpider anti-torpedo torpedo defense system installed on the Schwedeneck -class test ship Helmsand during tests between 2017 and 2018 . ​​​​, Atlas Elektronik The actual interceptor has its own sonar system that can operate in active or passive modes. The hard-kill system can then either defeat that target with its explosive warhead or by physically slamming into it. SeaSpider’s most novel feature is the use of a rocket motor rather than more traditional chemical or electric propulsion systems found in most torpedoes. Atlas Elektronik says the resulting system is quieter, which in turn makes it easier for it to “hear” the threat and lock on. Magellan Aerospace Corporation also reaches its top speed very quickly, meaning that the interceptor sinks less after launch, making it well suited to shallower water environments. The configuration is sensitive enough that Atlas Elektronik blurred out the rear of the interceptor in the photo it released of one of the launches during the sea trials. A diagram showing the internal configuration of the SeaSpider system’s anti-torpedo interceptor., Atlas Elektronik Atlas Elektronik also says that SeaSpider can be employed by submarines, either from hull-mounted launch tubes, such as those typically used to employ traditional acoustic decoys, or from its torpedo tubes. In the latter case, the company says it would provide a sub-caliber insert to stabilize more than one of the small anti-torpedo interceptors inside the larger tube. SeaSpider launcher options., Atlas Elektronik “The full ‘sensor to shooter’ functional chain of a hardkill surface ship torpedo defense system with torpedo detection, classification and localization (TDCL) and the SeaSpider anti-torpedo-torpedo (ATT) has successfully been demonstrated on a surface ship,” Atlas Elektronik had said in a statement earlier in April 2019 . The targets were an underwater target drone derived from an American-made Mk 37 torpedo and inert examples of the DM2A3 torpedo, another Atlas Elektronik product. Both the Mk 37 and the DM2A3 are electrically-powered. But other details about SeaSpider are limited. The German Navy says that any details about its anti-torpedo torpedo program, including whether or not it even exists, is classified, according to Defense News . Canada has not publicly announced its intention to buy such a system, either, though Magellan Aerospace and Atlas Elektronik are actively targeting Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) requirements, according to Jane’s 360 . It’s not clear what ships either party might be looking at equipping with the system, either. The RCN is very early on in the process of acquiring new frigates from a team including BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin. Whatever the case, the torpedo threat is certainly real and growing . Advanced submarines, including non-nuclear types with ultra-quiet air-independent diesel-electric propulsion systems, along with torpedoes with their own countermeasures , are proliferating around the world. Wake-homing torpedoes , which rely primarily on detecting differences in water density to zero in on a ship or submarine’s wake, are largely immune to existing acoustic decoys and electronic warfare jammers. A deactivated Russian Type 53-65K torpedo, an early wake-homing variant of the Type 53 family., BrokenSphere via Wikimedia Other countries are also pursuing similar hard-kill anti-torpedo defenses, as well. For around a decade now, Russian unveiled its own anti-torpedo torpedo system called Paket-E/NK . The United States is pursuing its own similar program, along with a variant of the interceptor optimized as an offensive weapon, which you can read about in more detail in a recent War Zone feature . Magellan Aerospace and Atlas Elektronik are certainly looking growing demand for anti-torpedo torpedo systems and could find customers beyond just the navies in Canada and Germany, too. But the real question is whether SeaSpider can go through the entire complex targeting process and then launch the interceptor in a time frame short enough to be a viable defensive system. Reducing the rate at which false positive detections of possible threats occur is “the main challenge,” Thorsten Bochentin, the SeaSpider project head, said in an interview with Defense News . Earlier this year, the U.S. Navy revealed that it had removed prototype anti-torpedo torpedo defenses from five Nimitz -class aircraft carriers after testing showed that systems had a very high false positive rate and were generally unreliable. The service has now put the program on indefinite hold, at least officially . With at least one round of sea trials under their belt, Magellan Aerospace and Atlas Elektronik are now looking to move SeaSpider into the next phase of development and that their system can meet the growing demand for this kind of hard-kill anti-torpedo torpedo defense.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",SR-71’s “R2-D2” Could Be The Key To Winning Future Fights In GPS Denied Environments,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With all the technology at our fingertips today, the very idea of celestial navigation remains a romantic and even a bit bewildering one. It harkens back to a time when mankind had a much richer connection with the heavens above. But the truth is the task of navigating by the stars became increasingly automated and miniaturized as a necessity of the Cold War. The advent of the Global Position System (GPS) and the diminished threat of all-out nuclear armageddon left advanced celestial navigation capabilities for a small number of weapon systems and the history books. But now, with the possibility of having to fight in a combat environment where GPS and all its benefits are denied, updated automated “astro-nav” capabilities may represent one of the best and most proven ways of overcoming this challenge. Addicted to GPS Suffice to say that beginning in Operation Desert Storm , America’s military might has become increasingly dependent on a stable and highly accurate GPS system. Everything from ballistic missile submarines to formations of armor use this service to leverage instant geo-locating abilities, as do the majority of guided munitions, and especially those that are fired from standoff ranges. Combat aircraft and fighting ships largely navigate using inertial navigation systems (INS) with embedded GPS. You can read all about these amazing pieces of technology here . Inertial navigation systems have gyros that are capable of sensing inertia and orientation and work as something of a self-contained dead-reckoning apparatus. They alone are capable of getting an aircraft or ship into the general area it needs to be, but over space and time their positioning accuracy degrades. In other words, the longer a vehicle navigates on INS alone, the more inaccurate their actual position will be. A modern miniaturized ring-laser gyro system., Honeywell These systems are especially susceptible to drift if they don’t get periodic “updates” from another navigational source, such as GPS or radio navigation aids. INS with embedded GPS systems aren’t just found on large military vehicles either, they are also used on munitions as lowly as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and even guided artillery shells. INS with embedded GPS works as sort of a voting set of systems that use software algorithms or filters to collectively best decide upon the aircraft’s position based on the data at hand. If one source begins to stray heavily or shows signs of malfunction, software can discount it and rely more heavily on the other. GPS spoofing, where the GPS signal is replaced with a fake one, is one electronic warfare tactic that is becoming alarming common, with Russia using it during training and other mysterious scenarios in the recent past. Advanced and highly targeted GPS spoofing attacks could theoretically be especially insidious as the fake signal could provide data that slowly changes a vehicle’s true location over time, making the anomaly far less noticeable to human operators or to a GPS/INS navigation systems of software logic. These more localized and targeted GPS tampering tactics are one thing, but denying GPS over a small or broad area altogether is even more concerning, and this is a threat that is growing in size and complexity, with Russia indicating they would leverage it to gain an asymmetric advantage during a time of war. Electronic and cyber warfare are the likely avenues of such an attack, but anti-satellite weaponry that can disable, jam, or even destroy satellite navigation capabilities at the source are a more troubling tactical possibility to factor in when facing off against a capable peer-state foe. But lower-end jamming and cyber attack capabilities targeting GPS aren’t just relegated to traditional foes. Non-state actors will be increasingly capable of waging war on this level as well. With all this in mind, GPS vulnerability has become a far more pressing strategic issue as of late and the Pentagon is scrambling to find new ways—or even old ways—of negating the impact of these types of enemy operations. One potential antidote for the issue, at least for some systems and platforms, may include reviving and modernizing a truly “back to the future” concept—automated celestial navigation, also referred to as “astro-nav.” From sextants to R2-D2 Decades before the advent of GPS, manual celestial navigation remained a skill used in both the maritime environment and in the skies. Even fairly modern aircraft were designed with this form of navigation in mind. For instance, the 747 was designed with a sextant port, and the VC-10 and 737 were designed with a sextant periscope. But even this secondary navigation aid became obsolete as radio navigational systems became far more prevalent and accurate. A VC-10 navigator “takes a shot” using the aircraft’s periscope sextant. , BOAC image via VC10.net Like so many key technologies we enjoy today, automated astro-navigation was introduced as a necessity of the Cold War. With the advent of weapons capable of traveling vast distances at high speed, there had to be a way to automatically correct for the inaccuracies that were intrinsic to inertial navigation systems. This problem gave birth to the astro-inertial navigation system (ANS). An absolutely cutting-edge system at the time of its conception, it was capable of automatically cross-checking a vehicle’s position as defined by its INS with that defined by its relation to the stars. This drastically improved the overall system’s accuracy and was able to correct for drift-related errors intrinsic to INS. This capability was first introduced on the SM-62 Snark cruise missile. The Snark was America’s precursor to the age of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. Initially, in 1957, the Snark showed that it had a circular error probability, also known as CEP (where the missile would impact in relation to its target), of 17 miles after flying thousands of miles downrange at high subsonic speeds to its target area. Even for a high-yield nuclear delivery system this was unacceptable. By 1958 the ANS system was installed and its CPE shrunk to four miles—an amazing accomplishment considering the technology of the era. The Snark’s astro-nav system. , Smithsonian Air and Space Museum The concept was drastically refined over the following years and AIN units found themselves on high-end platforms, including virtually all U.S. ICBMs to this very day, and one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments of all time—the SR-71 Blackbird . Because of the SR-71’s speed, proximity to very hostile countries, and the need to automate its reconnaissance sensors, not to mention the nature of its critical mission set, having highly accurate navigation that didn’t tax the crew’s resources unnecessarily was absolutely essential. The Nortronics NAS-14V2 astro-inertial navigation system provided this functionality for the Skunk Works’ mach three spy plane. The crate-sized guidance group, with the ANS on top, was dropped into the jet’s spine before missions. This system was eventually known by Blackbird crews, mission planners, and maintainers as “R2-D2,” and its job wasn’t that far from that of its famed Star Wars astromech droid namesake. NAS-14V2 , Smithsonian In a previous post featuring an incredible hands-on video tour of the Blackbird’s cockpits, SR-71 pilot Richard Graham also describes the jet’s astro-inertial navigation system in detail along with other recollections about operating the famous jet. The video is reposted below and the relevant part about the jet’s guidance group begins just at 53 minutes. It is an absolute must watch : Graham describes how all of the Blackbird’s sensors and navigation systems are automated by the guidance group, and the entire mission is pre-programmed into this system and the mission is tested on the ground before flight. The astro-nav’s gimbaled telescope-like system on top of the guidance group works by making an ever-widening circular search pattern to find and fix three of any of 64 mapped stars in its memory, and compares their locations to a Julian calendar and a highly accurate chronometer. And from this it provides a precise position as the jet sits on the ground or as it hurtles through the air at 80,000 feet and mach three. And all of the SR-71’s sensors are automatically programmed to take images, both optical and radar, based on where the aircraft is in time and space during its mission as defined by the astro-nav. Youtube Gif Graham goes on to make the point that really, the system isn’t that different than GPS that we use today. Instead of using a constellation of chronometer-packing satellites in orbit around the earth, the astro-nav uses the light from distant stars and its own chronometer to figure out its location. The gimbaled “telescope” on the NAS-14-V2, Smithsonian Evolved variations of the NAS-14V2 found themselves on other strategic aircraft as well, most notably the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The system is flush mounted to the left of the cockpit near the B-2’s intake. You can clearly see the plate-sized quartz glass window that covers the astro-tracker’s gimbaled telescope in aerial refueling photos like the one below. Other astro-nav systems, like Lockheed’s AST-201, are also used on satellites so that they can independently orient themselves. You can see the astro-tracking system under the round window to the right of the B-2’s cockpit in this image. , USAF Another more advanced system was designed for the B-1B , called the ANS-26, which had a different configuration than that of the NAS-14, but even during the waning days of SR-71 Blackbird operations, the system combined with INS was supposedly able to put the aircraft within roughly a 300 foot box in space and time. Bringing automatic celestial navigation into the future New astro-trackers use a far less mechanically complex systems to provide astro-tracking, such as those that get rid of the gimbaled telescope and use a very wide angle staring sensor array in its place. This technology has actually been around since the end of the Cold War in the form of systems like Northrop’s Optical Wide-angle Lens Startracker (OWLS), which uses a holographic lens and a sensor system that is far more sensitive and thus more capable of detecting stars. More recently Northrop Grumman has fielded its LN-120G Stellar-Inertial-GPS navigation system that is used on RC-135 surveillance aircraft. This relatively compact system integrates a modern INS system with GPS and astro-tracking, giving a triple redundant capability and positive performance even in GPS-spoofing or GPS-denied environments. Considering where these aircraft operate—near the borders of potentially hostile countries—it is a very good capability to have. RC-135, USAF Today, this type of capability could be miniaturized even further, possibly into a shoebox-sized array and computing system, one that uses multiple staring CCD arrays to continuously scan the entire sky at one time. Such a system could be flush mounted into combat aircraft or possibly carried in a pod that protrudes from under a tactical aircraft’s wing. Even something like the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System (DAS) may be capable, or at least adaptable, to providing highly precise celestial navigation running as something of a “background app” on top of the system’s other tactical functions. And instead of having 64 stars in its memory banks it could have thousands, and may be able to drastically reduce the margin of inaccuracy of earlier systems. F-35B during a night test sortie, USMC Regardless of the exact configuration of a modern airborne celestial navigation system, such a capability could largely overcome the loss of GPS. It may even be possible to create a “virtual GPS” system by using high-flying aircraft with astro-navigation and other GPS denied technologies installed onboard to support tactical platforms operating below. Such a concept could allow for a semi-centralized GPS replacement approach and would theoretically be able to not just provide navigation for aircraft but also for their weaponry, at least over a finite period of time and geographic area. In other words, only these high-flying aircraft would require unique systems like astro-nav, but all the allied aircraft and weaponry in their immediate combat environment would benefit from them in a similar fashion to how GPS functions today. For instance, a trio of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealthy drones , such as the shadowy RQ-180, or even high-flying B-21 bombers , could penetrate into enemy airspace prior to or along with a strike force of tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, and air-launched decoys . These HALE platforms would use automatic celestial navigation systems and well as other advanced GPS denied navigation tactics, to establish a very accurate position at all times and then they could data-link this information to the tactical platforms and munitions below. This would allow these assets to come up with highly precise positioning in time and space. Basically, this is a temporary and survivable GPS network. And because it isn’t persistent, it would be much harder to degrade or outright jam. If it could use proprietary data-links , especially the directional kind such as the F-35’s MADL , instead of an omni-directional GPS-like or Link 16 signal, it could be even more survivable. Northrop Grumman For the future, unmanned combat air vehicle swarms could leverage celestial navigation and would also be able to do so in a cheaper “distributed” manner. Not all UCAVs in a swarm would need such a system, say just one per division, or sub-swarm, of say between six and a dozen aircraft. That aircraft can provide positioning updates to other UCAVs in their division. If that UCAV were lost or had a mission abort, that division could simply joint another with a functioning astro-nav carrying unit. Benefits and increased accuracy could also likely be realized by networking multiple astro-nav equipped drones together over a large area. Pairing this capability with other capabilities, like miniaturized atomic clocks and/or BAE’s Navigation Via Signals of Opportunity (NAVSOP), which uses existing electromagnetic radiation in the environment, like cell phone tower and television signals, or even the emissions from GPS jammers themselves, to provide positioning information, or onboard atomic clocks, or radar imagery matching concepts, could result in highly reliable and redundant automated navigational capabilities without the need for space-based assistance. BAE SYSTEMS The bottom line here is that we know by experience that celestial navigation, the oldest form of navigation really, works very well in an automated form, and considering how far technology has come since the end of the Cold War, especially in terms of automation and sensors, the astro-nav concept is likely ready for a massive breakthrough in miniaturization and accuracy. In doing so, it could give the U.S. a decisive edge in future high-end combat scenarios, and some of those scenarios may include U.S. forces jamming GPS around themselves on their own accord. Years ago I predicted that small hobbyist-like drones would become the scourge of the modern battlefield as well as the terrorist assassins of the future. Sadly, reality has arrived, and a future where swarms of small drones will be a mainstream military capability for which there is little established kinetic defense against is now on the horizon. But the Achilles heal of this concept is that small and cheap drones rely entirely on GPS navigation . So denying GPS around friendly troop emplacements, vessels, airstrips, and other critical infrastructure could be the only realistic defense against it. In other words, having the ability to “turn off” GPS by whatever means without it having a major impact on your own military operations could be a massive strategic advantage in future conflicts. Time for an astro-navigation 2.0 An astro-navigation renaissance is already underway in the U.S. Navy, which is teaching ancient skills to its sailors once again due to the threat of losing GPS capabilities. And there are increasing calls to field new automated astro-nav systems on vessels to augment, and in the case of war, even take the place of GPS in their integrated navigational suites. Don’t be surprised if this technology begins to be assessed by the Army for land combat uses as well. USN Of course there are limitations to these systems as well, and poor weather and battlefield obscurants can drastically curtail their use. But these issues are far less impactful on aircraft, and especially high-flying ones that serve strategic purposes. In the end reviving this Cold War era concept seems like one of the easiest ways of providing a more resilient combat force capable of taking on future enemy tactics. When these systems are paired with other emerging anti-GPS denial technologies they could provide a potent alternative to GPS to the point that maybe American warfighters would be able to do without the service in order to gain a leg-up on the enemy who doesn’t benefit from such a capability. Above all else the asto-nav is another reminder that some of the hardest problems facing military planners today could very well be answered using technologies once deemed obsolete. When it comes to celestial navigation, looking “back to the future” may be far easier a proposition that simply looking forward.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 30, 2019",One of Saudi Arabia’s RE-3A Spy Planes Now Looks Just Like a U.S. Air Force RC-135,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. During a ceremony to mark the end of its multi-national Joint Gulf Shield training exercise, Saudi Arabia has revealed that one of its airliner-sized RE-3A spy planes has received some extensive modifications. The aircraft now features a distinctive “hog nose,” similar to the U.S. Air Force’s RC-135V/W Rivet Joint , as well as other notable visual changes. This particular RE-3A, also known as a Tactical Airborne Surveillance System (TASS), with the serial number 1901, is one of three RE-3 aircraft the Royal Saudi Air Force operates. This fleet reportedly consists of two RE-3A TASS types and a single RE-3B Improved Tactical Airborne Surveillance System (ITASS) aircraft, the latter of which carries the serial 1902. All of these aircraft started life as KE-3As, an aerial refueling tanker that Boeing derived from the E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS. Saudi Arabia acquired a number of E-3A and KE-3A aircraft in the 1980s with help from the U.S. Air Force as part of the Peace Sentinel program. The U.S. Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, a special projects office better known by the nickname Big Safari , helped manage the subsequent RE-3A and RE-3B conversions. According to U.S. Air Force records, there may be or have been a less intensive KE-3B TASS conversion that that retained some of the KE-3A’s aerial refueling capability. Saudi E-3 and KE-3 types were also present during the aerial review following the end of Joint Gulf Shield earlier in April 2018, which also included representatives from 24 other countries . E Systems, which defense contractor Raytheon purchased in the 1990s, performed the initial RE-3 conversions . Based on a 2009 announcement from the Defense Security Cooperation (DSCA), the main Pentagon office charged with facilitating foreign military assistance, it appeared that L-3 had taken over responsibility for the program. Big Safari was still managing the program on Saudi Arabia’s behalf as of 2014, according to separate documents we at The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. Official US Air Force descriptions of Saudi Arabia’s KE-3 and RE-3 types. Note that these inaccurately state that the KE-3s used TF-33 rather than CFM-56 engines., USAF via Andreas Parsch The newest iteration of 1901, with its elongated nose and “chipmunk cheeks” on either side of the forward fuselage, appears almost identical to the latest RC-135V/Ws. On the Rivet Joint, at least in the past, these fairings on the side contain the powerful Automatic Electronic Emitter Locating System (AEELS), which the crew can use to geolocate signal emitters. The additional vents seen on the most recent versions, as well as the new Saudi RE-3A, could indicate they have an updated version of this equipment. In addition, it has revised dorsal and ventral antenna arrays that closely mirror those on the U.S. Rivet Joints, as well as those on the U.K. Royal Air Force’s Airseeker. The latter aircraft is itself a derivative of the RC-135V/W. It is almost certain that RE-3A’s new ventral antennas form the core of a signals intelligence suite, able to locate, categorize, and monitor a variety of hostile emissions. In U.S. Air Force service, one of the Rivet Joints’ primary missions is to help analysts build an accurate “electronic order of battle” with the locations and types of enemy radars, communications nodes, and other transmitters. They are also very capable of listening in on enemy communications chatter, which analysts and linguists onboard can then exploit in real time before passing on to other units. A US Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint showing similar cheek fairings and ventral antenna arrays to the Saudi’s new RE-3A., USAF The antennas along the spine of the fuselage likely belong to the aircraft’s own communications systems, which could include a number of different radios and data links to allow personnel on board to forward along information rapidly back to base or to troops on the ground. In 2009, the U.S. government approved the possible sale of approximately $530 million dollars worth of upgrades for the Saudi RE-3s, which focused heavily on upgrading the aircraft’s ability to transmit information reliably and securely. The complete planned package included 10 AN/ARC-230 High Frequency Secure Voice/Data Systems, 25 AN/ARC-231 or 25 AN/ARC-210 Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) Secure Voice/Data Systems, and four Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Low Volume Terminals (MIDS-LVT), as well as a variety of encryption systems. The work would also include improved LN-100GT combination inertial and GPS navigation systems and updates to existing ground terminals capable of receiving information from the planes. “The proposed upgrade will enable the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) to sustain their current capability, maintain interoperability with USAF and other coalition forces, and provide flexibility [sic] options for future growth,” DSCA said at the time. “The upgrade will enhance the RSAF’s ability to use a common architecture for efficiently communicating the gathered electronic data, within the RSAF and with other regional coalition forces.” The Royal Saudi Air Force’s RE-3A, serial number 1901, as she existed in 2010., Carlos Menendez San Juan via Wikimedia It is not clear from the announcement whether those improvements were slated to go into all three RE-3s or just the two RE-3A TASS aircraft. It’s also not clear whether or not 1901’s latest guise is a product of those modifications specifically or a separate upgrade program. Whatever the case, the Saudis have undoubtedly employed the aircraft in their campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The RE-3’s signal scooping systems would be able to monitor the militants’ movements and gather additional information about their activities. With its real-time exploitation and communications capabilities, the crew could quickly pass that intelligence on to rapidly enable air and artillery strikes or aid in ground operations. The Saudi-led coalition is also actively blockading ports in Houthi-controlled areas in order to curtail the ability of the group to resupply and acquire new and more advanced weapons and other equipment. The RE-3s could monitor transmissions to and from ships suspected of smuggling aid to the militants and help direct other air and naval forces to investigate targets of interest. The new systems on 1901 could be important for monitoring developments with regards to the Houthis’ increasingly threatening ballistic missile , anti-ship cruise missile , and air defense capabilities . The revised configuration could be especially well suited to identifying radar-guided surface-to-air missile sites, which the Saudis claim the rebels are trying to establish with Iranian help. A Royal Saudi Air Force F-15S jet combat aircraft., USAF But the multi-purpose system would be extremely valuable for the Saudis, especially given the relatively small number of RE-3s they have with which to conduct both tactical and strategic intelligence operations. The aircraft, and its ability to help build that aforementioned electronic order of battle, would be an essential capability in any large-scale regional conflict against an opponent with a more robust air defense network, particularly one involving Iran . The U.S. Air Force already sends RC-135s of various types to peer into Iran from international airspace in the Persian Gulf on a routine basis . It is very possible that the Saudis might be interested in doing the same, if they aren’t already doing so to some degree. Having the best possible sense of where Iran’s air defense nodes are situated would only improve the effectiveness of strikes, as well as the survivability of Saudi aircraft, if the two countries were to find themselves in an all-out conflict. The new RE-3 can only give the Royal Saudi Air Force an important edge in planning any such missions against any more conventional adversaries in the future. More immediately, the aircraft could be invaluable for keeping tabs on Iranian activities if they follow through with plans to establish more formal military bases in various countries the region. If nothing else, the RE-3s already give the Royal Saudi Air Force an intelligence gathering platform that few others in the region possess. The new upgrades to 1901 can only further expand Saudi Arabia’s capabilities to conduct these missions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Nov 17, 2020",The U.S. Army’s New Up-Gunned Stryker Armored Vehicles Have Been Hacked,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been more than a year since the first up-gunned Stryker Dragoon armored vehicles arrived in Europe, giving elements of the U.S. Army’s forward-deployed 2nd Cavalry Regiment a much-needed boost in firepower against potential threats . Since then, unfortunately, unspecified “adversaries” – a term the U.S. military has used in the past to describe the Russians , but that could also mean surrogate opponents during an exercise – have also been able to disrupt certain systems on the vehicles with a cyber attack on at least one occasion. The Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, revealed the existence of the Stryker Dragoon’s cyber vulnerabilities in its most recent annual report on the status of the vehicle’s ongoing development during the 2018 Fiscal Year. The initial batch of these vehicles, also known as the XM1296 or the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-Dragoon (ICV-D), touched down in Germany in December 2017 . The Army had begun developing the new variant, which features a new turret with a 30mm automatic cannon, directly in response to a request from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in 2015 . “Adversaries demonstrated the ability to degrade select capabilities of the ICV-D when operating in a contested cyber environment,” DOT&E’s report, which the office released in January 2019 , said. “In most cases, the exploited vulnerabilities pre-date the integration of the lethality upgrades.” The report does not say where the cyber attack or attacks occurred or what specific systems they impacted. It seems most likely that the attacks had an effect on the vehicle’s data-sharing, navigation, or digital communications capabilities. Disrupting any of these systems, or adding false or confusing information into the networks, can hamper or slow U.S. operations or create added risks for American forces. Army combat vehicles have onboard GPS navigation systems, as well as a GPS-enabled data-sharing system known as Blue Force Tracker that provides various information, including their relative position to friendly and possible hostile forces, which can help prevent friendly fire incidents. The vehicles themselves may not have been the specific target, either. Cyber attacks against computer networks supporting any of the Stryker Dragoon’s onboard systems could have had a second-order effect on the vehicle’s ability to use those capabilities. There have been a string of reports from U.S. government watchdogs warning about serious cyber vulnerabilities across the U.S. military. There is no indication from DOT&E’s report that any other Stryker variants besides the Dragoon have experienced cyber attacks under any circumstances, but the report notes that these issues are not related to the “lethality upgrades.” This implies that the vulnerabilities are at least present in the standard M1126 Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV) and improved M1256 ICV with the blast-resistant double-v-hull . Depending on which systems are vulnerable, these issues may be present in other Stryker variants or entirely separate vehicle types, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=QZkeHlqXV_Y The review only recommends the Army “correct or mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.” The service should also “mitigate system design vulnerabilities to threats as identified in the classified report,” DOT&E added. But most importantly, the report does not qualify who the “adversaries” in question were, raising the possibility that up-gunned Strykers were the victims of an actual hostile cyber attack in the 2018 Fiscal Year, which ran from Oct 1, 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018. DOT&E may have been referring to a mock enemy cyber attackers during a drill. In the face of growing cybersecurity threats , the U.S. military as a whole, as well as its NATO allies , has increasingly sought to simulate these dangers in training exercises. Czech cybersecurity experts at work during a NATO exercise., NATO However, in typical military parlance faux opponents are more often described as the “ opposing force ,” or OPFOR, or as “ aggressors .” For a time, the U.S. Air Force actually had units designated as “ Information Warfare Aggressor Squadrons .” “Strykers from 2nd Cavalry Regiment do train in a contested environment within our exercises,” Lacey Justinger, a spokesperson for the Army’s 7th Army Training Command, or 7ATC, in Germany, told The War Zone in an Email. “During those exercises, our free-thinking opposing force at 7ATC’s Joint Multinational Readiness Center is equipped and able to perform in a realistic manner that mimics the most challenging traits of any potential adversary.” Justinger declined to confirm or deny whether an actual adversary had launched cyber attacks impacting the Stryker Dragoons. “We will not speculate as to what adversary the Office of the Director of Test and Evaluation references in their reports,” she said, referring us to DOT&E. DOT&E’s public affairs liaison is on leave and that office directed us to contact the Department of Defense’s main public affairs office. “For operations security reasons, DOD does not comment on specific risks or vulnerabilities,” Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokesperson, told us in a separate response to our queries. A Stryker Dragoon fires its main gun during an exercise., US Army But it seems very possible DOT&E’s report was referring to at least one actual cyber attack on American forces in Europe. “Adversary” is typically reserved for actual or potential opponents. “A party acknowledged as potentially hostile to a friendly party and against which the use of force may be envisaged,” is the definition of the term in the January 2019 edition of the official Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms. “Right now in Syria, we’re in the most aggressive EW [electronic warfare] environment on the planet from our adversaries,” U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, said in remarks at a symposium in April 2018 . “They’re testing us every day, knocking our communications down, disabling our AC-130s, etcetera.” Thomas never named names, but this was almost certainly a reference to Russian or Russian-support forces in Syria. DOT&E’s report could easily be making another veiled claim about the Kremlin with regards to the Army’s Stryker Dragoons in Europe. Since October 2017, there has been a steady string of reports of electronic warfare and cyber attacks against NATO members with the likely culprit almost universally being Russia.  The attacks have ranged from scrambled GPS signals to actual attempts to hack into cellphones belonging to American troops. A US Army soldier takes a selfie with other American and Polish troops during an exercise in Europe., US Army Just on Feb. 11, 2019 , the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), the country’s top military intelligence agency, also known as the Etterretningstjenesten or E-tjenesten , once again publicly accused the Russians of jamming GPS signals in the country’s far north. In November 2018 , Finland had also publicly stated that they were in agreement with their Norwegian colleagues that the Kremlin was behind a string of disruptions of the satellite navigation system in northern Scandinavia. “This is not only a new challenge for Norwegian and Allied training operations,” NIS head Norwegian Air Force Lieutenant General Morten Haga Lunde said while presenting an annual risk assessment report on Feb. 11, 2019 . “Jamming is also a threat to, among others, civilian air traffic and police and health operations in peacetime.” Haga Lunde has said in the past that he does not believe these electronic warfare attacks were intentional, but were instead more likely a byproduct of Russian military exercises on the other side of the two country’s shared border. Russia has invested significant resources in developing and fielding a slew of land-based jamming systems and routinely deploys them during drills . It has also fielded them in conflict zones such as Ukraine and Syria . A Russian 1L266 electronic warfare vehicle., Vitaly Kuzmin But it would seem almost impossible for a Russian cyber attack on U.S. forces to be accidental. These kinds of cyber intrusions still represent a way for Russia to test and harass American forces with relatively low practical and political costs. It has also proven to be a more readily deniable form of attack for the Kremlin, even in the face of formal, public protests, such as the ones from Norway and Finland. If the Russians are actually now targeting the systems on military vehicles, directly or indirectly, this would appear to be a significant escalation in the nature of these attacks, though, which have previously been more focused on individuals and personal devices. Degrading networks associated with the Stryker Dragoons instead seems to reflect an active attempt to probe American cyber defenses in Europe and test capabilities that might come into play in an actual crisis. “There is a continual effort to test, evaluate and integrate these advances across all warfighting functions to improve and maintain our readiness,” Justinger, the Army spokesperson, added. “The point of ongoing training opportunities and exercise scenarios like these [that include simulated cyber threats] is to find vulnerabilities, correct and strengthen them before battle, in order to offer our Soldiers the best and safest equipment, practices and procedures to ensure they come home safe to their families and friends.” But it appears that the U.S. military, especially forces in Europe might be finding out about these cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the field, regardless of whether any exercises are supposed to help uncover them under training conditions.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2019",U.S. Air Force F-35A’s First Combat Deployment To The Middle East Has Begun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has sent F-35A Joint Strike Fighters on their first-ever operational deployment to the Middle East. The arrival of stealthy fighter jets to the region comes after the service decided to pull its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from the region for the first time in years. It also follows a successful first combat outing for Marine F-35Bs, which involved strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria , as well as sorties in Afghanistan against the Taliban. An unspecified number of F-35As touched down at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, an important base for the United States in the region, on Apr. 15, 2019, according to an official press release . The aircraft, as well as maintenance and support personnel, came from both the active duty 388th Fighter Wing and the Air Force Reserve 419th Fighter Wing, both of which are based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. The two units began making their way to the Middle East last week, according to another official news item . In November 2018, they had also taken part in a massive readiness exercise , or “Elephant Walk,” involving 35 F-35As taking off in rapid succession. “We are adding a cutting edge weapons system to our arsenal that significantly enhances the capability of the coalition [fighting ISIS],” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), said in a statement . “The sensor fusion and survivability this aircraft provides to the joint force will enhance security and stability across the theater and deter aggressors.” The Air Force has previously deployed the F-35A operationally to Europe and the Pacific region , but they did not take part in any active conflicts in those theaters. The service said it had reached initial operational capability with the type in 2016 . An Air Force F-35A at Al Dhafra Air Base., USAF In the Middle East, it seems very likely that the F-35As will quickly find themselves flying sorties against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Marine F-35Bs from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Group previously conducted strikes against militants in those two countries during a deployment that wrapped up in February 2019 . Some of the Air Force’s Joint Strike Fighters may make additional deployments further on to Afghanistan, to take part in the ongoing conflict there. The Marine F-35Bs had flown to that country and conducted their first-ever strikes against the Taliban in September 2018 , which were also the first strikes any American F-35s from any service had ever conducted. An F-35A taxies at Al Dhafra., USAF From Al Dhafra, the stealthy F-35As will also provide an important regional capability to respond to more serious crises , if necessary. In February 2019, the Air Force revealed it had withdrawn its F-22s from this same base in the UAE and replaced them with F-15C Eagles , instead. Rotational deployments of Raptors to Al Dhafra have been regular occurrences since 2009 and the F-22s have played an important role in the region since then. In 2013 , one of the stealth jets intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that harassing an Air Force MQ-1 Predator drone in the Persian Gulf . https://youtube.com/watch?v=hl6_8UsLW8U The next year , F-22s saw their first combat missions over Syria. They were subsequently a regular presence in northeastern Syria, providing important on-call support to U.S.-backed fighters and their coalition advisors and helping chase away Syrian and Russian combat aircraft that could have threatened those forces. The F-22s have been an important capability for the U.S. military to have in the region in order to be able to rapidly respond in potentially high-risk situations, such as near western Syria, where Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian and Iranian benefactors have significant air defenses , and in the Persian Gulf, where tensions routinely run high with Iranian forces . The Raptors have been the only aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS penetrating western Syria , at all. The F-35As will now be able to fulfill that important role from Al Dhafra. As Lieutenant General Guastella, the Joint Strike Fighters will also give the Air Force another valuable sensor and electronic warfare platform in the region, as well. The Joint Strike Fighter’s ability to fuse data from these systems together make it an even more powerful asset than the Raptors in this regard, passively scooping up electronic signatures from radars and other radio frequency emitters in the region. This could help in building up an electronic “ order of battle ” of composition and location of enemy defenses that could be useful when planning future missions . They also can provide non-traditional reconnaissance with their electro-optical and infrared sensors, as well. With its sensor fusion and data sharing capabilities, the Joint Strike Fighters will also be able to act as important leaders to “‘quarterback’ for the coalition joint force” during air operations, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said in a statement . This is another role the F-22 had previously filled in the region. An F-35A taxies at Hill Air Force Base ahead of the deployment to the Middle East., USAF The F-35A also brings another new capability to the region over the F-22s. Unlike the F-22s, these jets can carry laser-guided bombs inside their weapon bays and have a built-in Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) that is able to guide those laser guided bombs onto moving targets , all while still flying in their maximum stealth mode. The combination of a stealth aircraft with an organic laser-guided bomb targeting and delivery capability is something that the U.S. military has lacked since the official retirement of the F-117A in 2008. This, along with persistent, but unsubstantiated rumors , has led some to believe that the Nighthawks had actually been regenerated to fly covert missions in the Middle East in recent years. The War Zone has examined those claims in depth and has also looked at the possibility that the Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, or some combination of U.S. government entities is flying the General Atomics Avenger drone in the region to provide this capability. Sending the F-35As to the Middle East is also an important demonstration of the Air Force’s ability to deploy the jets operationally. The service, as well as the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, has been struggling to reverse fledgling mission capable rates for the Joint Strike Fighters, as well as other types of fighter aircraft. Personnel accompanying the Air Force’s first deployment of F-35As to the Middle East board charter Boeing 747s., USAF The decision to pull the F-22s out of the region was actually driven by efforts to work toward meeting the Pentagon-mandated goal of hitting an average 80 percent mission capable rate across the Raptor fleet by the end of 2019. The Pentagon has stipulated that this is same mission capable rate is the readiness goal for F-35s across the U.S. military, too. The War Zone will definitely be keeping an eye out for further information about the USAF’s F-35A’s first trip to the Middle East, which could soon include the first-ever combat missions for the service’s Joint Strike Fighters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 21, 2019",New Contender For The Army’s High-Speed Armed Scout Helicopter Program Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. AVX Aircraft and L3 Technologies have revealed an advanced compound helicopter design with a coaxial main rotor as their entry for the U.S. Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. The service wants a high-speed, long-range “ knife fighter ” that will be a spiritual successor to the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior armed scout helicopter and the winning rotorcraft could replace up to half of the service’s existing AH-64 Apache gunships . The two companies unveiled their joint entry to coincide with the Army Aviation Association of America’s 2019 Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit on Apr. 15, 2019. They had previously announced that they had submitted a design together in December 2018 . The Army says it will consider between four and six total designs for Phase 1 of the FARA program, before down-selecting two just two competitors in 2020 . “We are extremely pleased to reveal the design for this very important U.S. Army program,” Troy Gaffey, AVX CEO and Chief Engineer, said in a press release. “AVX and L3 provide unique engineering design skills and manufacturing expertise that will provide the Army with an advanced, lethal and affordable reconnaissance and light-attack platform.” The design the two firms have put forward has obvious similarities to AVX’s previous design work , featuring two ducted fans, one on each side of the upper fuselage, to provide forward thrust, along with a coaxial main rotor. The chopper has small wings near the top of the fuselage, as well as rear stabilizers, too. Another artist’s conception of AVX and L3’s FARA submission., AVX/L3 The official press release did not include any performance specifics, but the Army has made clear it is looking for the FARA to have better speed and range compared to the AH-64 Apache gunship. The latest AH-64E variant has a top speed of around 170 miles per hour in level flight and a maximum, unrefueled range of around 300 miles. Compound helicopters in general typically offer much greater top speeds over traditional helicopters and the addition of wings can help reduce the load on the rotors, offering added efficiency. The helicopter also has two separate sub wings on either side of the lower fuselage for stores and the concept art shows it firing a Hellfire-type missile. The Army is looking to steadily replace those weapons with the improved Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM). The concept art shows a sensor turret on top of the nose that would include electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator. There is a turret with a multi-barrel Gatling type automatic cannon underneath the nose, as well. This weapon could be General Dynamics’ new XM915 20mm cannon , which is an evolution of the lightweight three-barrel XM301 it developed in the 1990s for the abortive RAH-66A Comanche stealthy armed scout helicopter. The XM301 was itself a derivative of the iconic six-barrel M61 Vulcan cannon and the earlier three-barrel M197 variant . The Army is interested in adding loitering munitions , as well as a precision-guided weapon that can function as both a powered missile and a glide bomb, to the FARA’s arsenal, according to Aviation Week . Raytheon’s AGM-176 Griffin, which is already in widespread use in the U.S. special operations community, as well as on small U.S. Navy vessels , could be one option, as it already meets the multi-function criteria. A variety of other miniature air-launched munitions and drones that could work with an aircraft-mounted launcher are also either in service or in development across the U.S. military. AVX and L3 say the helicopter will have a full fly-by-wire flight control system and features modular, open-architecture avionics and other mission systems to help rapidly incorporate upgrades in the future. This latter feature is one of the Army’s stated requirements for FARA entrants. The pilot and co-pilot will sit side-by-side in the cockpit, accord to the press release from the two companies. However, the Army has stipulated that any FARA design be able to operate in a pilot-optional mode, as well. Separately, the service is working together with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop a “digital co-pilot” that could reduce mental and physical strain on pilots and improve operational effectiveness and safety. You can read more about the Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program here . The design will also have significant component commonality with the compound helicopters they pitch for the other segments of the service’s broader Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program. This over-arching effort aims to replace all of the Army’s helicopters and could replace various other rotorcraft across the U.S. military. Interestingly, the press release from AVX and L3 says that their design will have folding rotors and wings that will allow it to fit inside a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport plane and within the hangar on an Arleigh Burke -class destroyer , the latter pointing to potential Navy interest in the FARA program. AVX and L3 have not made any specific mention about features to reduce their helicopter’s radar or infrared signatures, which the Army has also said it will be looking into as part of the FARA program. The service has also stipulated a need for a powerful electronic warfare suite so that whatever FARA design it chooses, in the end, can jam hostile radars for self-protection, as well as locate and destroy those threats to help clear the way for other friendly air assets. The concept art does show turrets that could be associated with a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system. These defensive systems, which you can read more about more here , use turreted lasers to blind and confuse the seekers on incoming infrared-homing missiles. Inclusion in the first phase of the FARA program would be a major development for AVX, which has been promoting its advanced compound helicopter designs since 2005. The company has worked on the Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) drone as part of a team with Northrop Grumman in the lead. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research are running that program together. But the Army declined to pursue an offering from the company for the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) fly-off, which is supposed to help inform various Future Vertical Lift requirements. The service picked Bell’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor and the SB>1 Defiant compound helicopter from Boeing and Sikorsky for this technology demonstration program. AVX also failed to win the Army’s Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program, which sought a direct replacement for the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. The Texas-based helicopter company had offered a novel solution that would have recycled OH-58D main fuselages and converted them into compound helicopters with the company’s characteristic dual ducted fan propulsion arrangement and coaxial rotor system. The Army ultimately picked a much less significant update offer from Bell, known as the OH-58F, before canceling the AAS program entirely, ostensibly due to budget constraints. In the end, the OH-58D fleet was retired outright. As an interim solution in place of the Kiowa Warriors, the Army established new Heavy Attack Reconnaissance Squadrons with a mix of AH-64 Apaches and RQ-7 Shadow drones. The service had also been working to pair the gunships with the larger MQ-1C Gray Eagle as an alternative combination to fulfill the attack reconnaissance mission . “The Apache is the best attack helicopter in the world, but it’s not the best armed reconnaissance helicopter,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Walter Rugen, head of the so-called FVL Cross-Functional Team (CFT) within the new Army Futures Command, told Aviation Week earlier in April 2019. “We need a smaller form factor that can hide in the radar clutter and that has reach.” What this means is that the Army is looking to award a very lucrative deal in the future to potentially replace hundreds of Apaches with the FARA design. The winning bidder will also be well positioned to win contracts to support the operation of those new rotorcraft for decades to come, as well as the development of future upgrades. When it comes to AVX, its decision to partner with L3 was no doubt driven in part by the attraction of leveraging the experience and U.S. military connections of a major established defense contractor with significant experience upgrading and modifying aircraft for the U.S. military. But this also means that competition will be especially steep. Sikorsky is almost certain to pitch a variant of its S-97 Raider compound helicopter, a design that is already flying and has been in flight testing for years now, making it a front-runner in the competition. Bell will propose a design, as well, but has been tight-lipped about what it will look like. It seems possible that this will be a derivative of its V-280 tilt-rotor, which is also in flight testing now . The company might also leverage the work it has done on the smaller V-247 Vigiliant tilt-rotor drone . In addition, Airbus also said it will propose a design derived from its world-record setting high-speed X3 compound helicopter demonstrator . The Army has also already rejected a proposal from MD Helicopters. This became public knowledge after the Government Accountability Office recently disclosed that it had dismissed a protest from that company alleging the Army had acted improperly in arriving at this decision. With the prospect of losing significant market share with its best customer, Boeing is also working on a compound helicopter derivative of the AH-64 that would offer greatly improved performance. It could potentially submit this as an offering for the FARA competition or pitch it as an outright alternative to an entirely new scout helicopter. The Army says it expects to make its final decisions about who will get to take part in Phase 1 of the FARA program between June and July 2019. AVX and L3’s entry could be up against significant competition just to get into this first round.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Stratolaunch, the space launch company founded in part by late billionaire and Microsoft Co-founder Paul Allen, has sent its gigantic Roc aircraft into the skies for the very first time. The flight occurred this morning at 6:46AM from Stratolaunch’s home at Mojave Air And Space Port in California. It was chased by a Cessna Citation jet during the inaugural flight. Roc now takes the throne as the world’s largest aircraft with a 385-foot wingspan, a gross takeoff weight of 1,300,000 pounds, and powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4056 Turbofan engines normally found on the 747-400. Combined, these engines put out a whopping 340,500 pounds of thrust. The Roc—it is nicknamed after the huge bird from Greek mythology —will haul rocket payloads up into the sky before sending them on their way into space. The idea is the craft acts as a completely reusable and flexibly deployable first stage, which could dramatically cut down the cost of putting payloads into space and do so in a highly flexible manner not offered by traditional launch-pad based systems. We have kept a close eye on the program, which has seen its scope somewhat curtailed since the death of its primary financial backer and visionary Paul Allen. A whole family of space-launch vehicles was intended to be carrier by Roc, now that has been paired down to just one, at least for the time being. As we have explained in the past , the Pentagon is likely to be Stratolaunch’s most interested and lucrative customer. Roc is still in the air at the time of publishing.

In other words, literally an off-topic thread. We can talk about this sweet HUD camera footage from a Rafale with an F-22 on the defensive: Or what about this K-9 that seems to defy gravity?: When your plane turns into a tuning fork it isn’t good: Aren’t cruise missiles in flight kinda eerie?: Or what about this all-star aggressor lineup: And this angle of the F-35 putting all its thrust to use is noteworthy: Fiery F135 goodness. Looking at roughly 43k lbs of thrust there. https://t.co/SDaVesRdWI — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) April 8, 2019 Finally, I want to address the elephant in the room—the new Star Wars trailer. Every generation has a legend. Watch the brand-new teaser for Star Wars: #EpisodeIX . pic.twitter.com/fWMS13ekdZ — Star Wars (@starwars) April 12, 2019 Bringing back the Emperor may be lazy writing and outright fan service, but Ian McDiarmid makes it all worth it. His turn in Revenge Of The Sith is hideously undervalued. It was truly evil. Literally insidious. And really, Palpatine was the curse of the Skywalker family from day one. In fact, if you follow what is happening in the comics that support the new storyline (I just read about them when they make nerd news), Palpatine appears to be far more than just a manipulative master to Darth Vader. But still, what the hell were they thinking not having a plan and sticking to it from the start? Rise Of Skywalker ? Riiiggghttt. So Rian Johnson’s entire movie, The Last Jedi, was a misfire that is now being painted over. He tried to put all the Skywalker stuff and the mystery box Abrams created to bed. Now that is being corrected for in a huge way. Case in point the title of the 9th Star Wars installment alone. The Last Jedi was really a poor decision, ok. It was. It totally shifted things up to the point that it now seems like fan fiction, a weird rest stop along the way in this new series. Gutting all the mystery from Episode 7 really took the wind out of people’s sails. They loved imagining cool theories about how it all fits together. Shitting on that was poison for the franchise. I think Solo got slapped the hardest by The Last Jedi as a result. Many fans felt disappointed and a bit cheated. I know I did. Being simply entertaining isn’t enough for an installment in a franchise that is nearly a world-wide religion. In all, it should make for a very disjointed trilogy unless Abrams really pulls off something of a force miracle (or a Jedi mind trick for that matter!), but that is a big ask for someone who is not known for crafting endings of stories. I just wonder how we will look back on these films, you know? And let’s be honest, the movie we all want to see is Star Wars: The Tragedy Of Dark Vader. One fan is trying to get that point across in a very creative and elaborate way: What are your thoughts? Set blasters on stun! The Bunker doors are open.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2019",Idahoans Sue Air Force To Stop It From Using Their Towns For Targeting Practice,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A number of Idaho citizens and an environmental conservation group are suing the Air Force in the U.S. District Court of Idaho in an attempt to stop them from using Idaho cities and towns as settings for urban close air support exercises. The complaint alleges that the Air Force didn’t go far enough to inform local residents about the drills and of the supposed hazards they bring to their communities. At the same time, it is crystal clear why the training is needed and it really isn’t something that can be provided on most gunnery ranges, such as the nearby Saylor Creek range where F-15E Strike Eagles from Mountain Home AFB regularly train. As it sits now, there would be up to 160 training days related to the program per year. Towns in Southwestern Idaho would be the primary locales for the exercises, but other locations in Idaho may also to be used. The Idaho Press has kept a watchful eye on the issue, and describes the training as such : Those war games, or “training events,” would include unarmed members of the military dressed as plainclothes civilians stationed in some of southwestern Idaho’s urban locations, such as downtown Boise. Military personnel on the ground would communicate with U.S. Air Force planes overhead, and the two groups would work together to find targets, which aircraft would identify with “low-power, eye-safe lasers,” according to a document released by the U.S. Air Force. The training events might take place during the day or at night, and U.S. Air Force officials have stressed the need for training to take place in a city setting to simulate “urban environments encountered in combat.” … Months ago, officials from the 366th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base proposed a regimen of “urban close air support training.” It’s a style of training the military has used since the 1990s, and it’s designed to prepare military personnel to fight in cities and towns. The training mixes military personnel with civilians in the community, but because those personnel are dressed as everyday residents, and are “trained to behave in a manner typical to any community member to avoid drawing attention to themselves or the operations,” residents may be unaware the training is taking place. Military personnel would drive unmarked cars and travel through public spaces. The training would not include any weapons, according to military documents. “Ground support teams would not interfere with civilian traffic or pedestrians,” according to the military’s environmental assessment, and military personnel would obey all local laws where the training would take place. The training would require planes to fly between 10,000 and 18,000 feet to various locations in southwest Idaho, including many in the Treasure Valley. In general, according to the project’s environmental assessment, two military aircraft would be in the air above a town or city at a time, communicating with military members on the ground. … Initially, authorities at Mountain Home Air Force Base pushed for the plan to allow 260 training days a year but “decided to reduce the proposed number of operations by approximately 40 percent following coordination with stakeholders and public communities during scoping events,” according to the environmental assessment. … The Air Force has emphasized the need to train in the “urban canyons” created by tall buildings, and Boise is by the far the largest city in the massive swath of proposed territory where the training would take place. A Mountain Home-based F-15E pops flares., USAF Training for Military Operations In Urban Terrain (MOUT) has taken on a whole new level of importance in recent years as the Pentagon grapples with a future in which it thinks wars will be fought mainly in so-called “megacities.” Training units to integrate air combat asset into these extremely complex combat environments is a key part of preparing for these types of contingency operations. The Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) that are tasked with this challenging work are the nexus between the airpower above and the forces on the ground and guide aircrews onto precise targets in dense urban environments. Technology is helping to speed up the time it takes from the initial radio contact between aircrews and JTACs to weapons impacting targets, but “talking crews onto a target” and using laser spotting systems are still the nuts and bolts of this very high-stakes business. You can see and hear this coordination for yourself in this past piece of ours. Accomplishing this in an urban setting where the variables drastically increase and simple issues like tall buildings blocking an aircraft’s targeting pod’s line of sight to the target or even the flight path of a weapon, or communications issues caused by tall buildings, or clearly distinguishing friend from foe can become robust challenges to overcome. The chances for collateral damage, in particular, skyrocket in urban close air support setting and so many factors have to be taken into account before a weapon is launched. For instance, a prime target may be easily struck, but if it is next to a hospital, house of worship, or a school, doing so may be against the rules of engagement or may cause more harm than good. The USAF laid out why it needs this training in its detailed environmental assessment and action plan for the exercises: Urban CAS operating environments typically range from small towns to large cities with corresponding extents of vertical development (e.g., tall buildings), population sizes, and cultural and community dynamics. During combat, aircraft commonly provide supporting firepower inoffensive and defensive operations to destroy, disrupt, suppress, neutralize, or delay hostile forces. The speed, range, maneuverability, and selection of integrated weapons systems of the aircraft involved allows CAS assets to attack targets that other friendly and allied forces may not be able to engage effectively (JCS 2014). When conditions for air operations are permissive, CAS can halt enemy attacks, help create breakthroughs, destroy targets, cover retreats, and guard flanks. While achieving these objectives, air and ground operations must be conducted in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program and Rules of Engagement (ROEs), which specifies that U.S. military forces will adhere to the following guidelines: • Act with proportionality, replying to hostility with only as much force as needed to eliminate the enemy • Distinguish combatants from noncombatants, and distinguish military objectives from protected places to minimize collateral damage • Prevent unnecessary suffering by safeguarding certain fundamental human rights of those involved in a conflict. The planning and execution of Urban CAS missions is difficult because these missions either require or inevitably involve the following: • operations in “urban canyons” (i.e., artificial canyons created by multistory buildings) • deconfliction of multiple aircraft operating within a confined airspace • operation in accordance with the ROEs • difficulty in threat analysis because of information, environmental, and visibility constraints • overload of visual cues associated with civilian traffic, presence of buildings, and varied landscape • presence of noncombatants proximal to identified threats • potential for collateral damage during engagement • increased risk of friendly fire with other allied air and ground teams in the area (JCS 2014). These operational circumstances cause tactical difficulties in properly identifying and locating potential targets while discerning and protecting Friendly Forces (FFOR). Both are critical for successful execution of Urban CAS missions. Readiness for Urban CAS missions requires that air and ground crews train intensively to gain practical experience responding to the following situations: • Loss of, or inability to maintain, communication. Urban terrain inhibits communications equipment and can absorb or reflect transmitted signals. • Difficulty identifying targets. Vertical development makes it difficult for aircrews to identify target combatants and may require specific positioning and orientation attack headings to achieve line-of-sight with an identified target. Ground-level observers may be positioned on upper floors of buildings to improve visibility. In these situations, ground teams (e.g., JTACs) mark and designate their positions or CAS target locations visually with an infrared laser pointer, electronically with a Global Positioning System (GPS) grid, or with a gridded reference graphic to guide aircraft tracking. • Difficulty maneuvering aircraft over urban terrain. Aircraft navigation over and through urban terrain can be more difficult than over natural terrain because maps do not show vertical development of urban terrain. • Requirement for navigational aids. Rapid movement from position to position can create confusion between aerial and ground observers as to friendly and enemy locations. Familiarity with the characteristics of urban terrain allows aircrews to discern key features in this environment. Navigational aids, such as GPS, have reduced but not eliminated this challenge. The use of the GPS and handheld laser pointers or designators eases the problems associated with night navigation, orientation, and target identification. • Conditions of limited visibility. Limited visibility may occur because of fog, smoke, or dust on the battlefield, but occurs most frequently because of operations extending into hours of darkness. Night navigation systems may be degraded because of interference induced by buildings and enemy GPS jamming equipment. Ability to provide CAS during times of limited visibility and adverse weather demands a higher level of proficiency that can only come about through dedicated, realistic CAS training. Aircrews and JTACs must routinely and consistently train together during such conditions to overcome visual limitations when the aircrew have only sensors and systems to guide them. • Artificial lighting. Rapidly changing lighting conditions from day/night operations and the effects from operating within terrain with artificial lighting impacts how the target presents against its background and the measures required to ensure an aircrew can distinguish it from its surroundings. Additionally, the artificial lighting of urban environments can limit the usefulness of night vision equipment because lights from buildings, streets, airports, and industrial areas can create glare and reduce visibility (JCS 2014). Considering Mountain Home Air Force Base houses three squadrons (two USAF and one training unit for the Republic of Singapore Air Force) of F-15Es—one of America’s most capable CAS platforms—providing this level of real-world training very nearby would be extremely beneficial. Otherwise, the aircraft would have to constantly deploy to other bases in order to receive similar training, and, even then, it will still be in someone’s “backyard.” Mountain Home AFB., Google Earth Saylor Creek Range nearby does have a Military Operations In Urban Terrain (MOUT) site, but it is austere and doesn’t feature larger multi-story buildings or a very complex layout , which only a handful of MOUT sites do across the country. Still, even the biggest MOUT site can’t compete with operating in an actual built-up city or town. It just isn’t something you can simulate to a high fidelity. That is why special operations teams and the 160th Special Operations Airborne Regiment (SOAR) constantly train in some of the biggest metropolises in the United States. It always causes a stir in the communities they descend on, but it is absolutely essential training that can’t be had anywhere else. A map of a representation of the area around Mountain Home AFB that would be used for the urban air support training. , USAF The USAF impact study describes the training operations as such: For Urban CAS proficiency training, a “training event” is a collection of “training operations” that would take place at a single urban area on a given day (i.e., 24-hour period). Therefore, discussion in this EA may interchangeably address training events as training days. A typical sortie would be defined as the round-trip, or, a departure and return flight of a single aircraft to the installation. Each leg of a sortie would be defined as a flight operation. During a training operation, 2 (or a maximum of 4) aircraft would depart the installation, enter the CAS wheel outside of an urban area, enter the urban center airspace to conduct training (for a duration of 60 to 90 minutes), then returning to the installation. Thus, a training operation would involve 2 (or a maximum of 4) sorties. Generally, only two aircraft would be in the urban center airspace at one time. However, fulfillment of proficiency training in operational transitions (or, “hand-offs”) from one pair of aircrews to another pair of aircrews would require presence of 4 aircraft in the CAS wheel. During an operational hand-off, the aircrew from a pair of aircraft that actively tracking in the urban center airspace would communicate status of the operation to the aircrew of the two aircraft remaining in the CAS wheel. Then, the aircraft in the urban center would exit to the CAS wheel, and the aircraft waiting in the CAS wheel would enter the urban center to continue the tracking effort. Each training operation would be followed by a 2- to 3-hour period of no flight activity during which ground support teams would organize for the next training operation. A training event may involve day or a combination of day-night training operations. Day training would occur between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. Night training would occur between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. … Prior to mission training operations, F-15E aircrews would maintain flight in a circular path, known as a CAS wheel, in the airspace that overlies the farther outskirts of town or the outermost edge of the 15-NM radius from the urban center point. … Ground teams would be working within the urban center in accordance with their particular force position (FFOR or OPFOR). To begin a mission scenario, members of the FFOR team would contact aircrews flying in the CAS wheel with a request for air support to identify and locate a hostile threat. The aircraft would separate from the CAS wheel, fly toward the urban center point, and be guided with instrumentation and communication to identify, track, and simulate neutralization of the OPFOR. The two aircraft would fly throughout the airspace overlying the city in a wedge formation where the lead aircraft would be positioned at a lower altitude and ahead of the second aircraft. The second aircraft serves to cover the lead aircraft from a higher altitude and reasonable distance behind, where visibility surrounding the first aircraft can be maintained. Flight tracking of OPFOR would continue until the point of simulated weapons fire. Upon mission completion, the aircraft would return to the installation. … Aircrews would use the on-board weapons firing simulation system to mock bomb identified targets. The proposed training operations would not involve use of weapons to fire munitions. Munitions would not be loaded on the F-15Es that are flown during the proposed proficiency training operations. Ground teams would not carry weapons. All interactions between air and ground teams would be achieved through use of electronic equipment including tactical communication radios (e.g., frequency modulation, very high frequency, ultra high frequency, and satellite communication), navigational GPS for maintaining awareness of target locations, low-power, eye-safe infrared training lasers for marking targets, and computer simulation systems on board the aircraft. Clearly, there is zero chance of a bomb or missile accidentally being launched on a civilian area. The aircraft are totally unarmed. But they won’t be silent overhead. The assessment also notes that 25 percent of the missions would occur at night, with activity occurring from 10 p.m.  to 7 a.m. The 190th Fighter Squadron, an A-10 Warthog unit, as well as Apaches from the Idaho Air National Guard, are located at nearby Boise International Airport. According to the USAF report, they don’t appear to be part of this training, which is surprising. One can only imagine that this would change if the exercises continue as intended. Also, Mountain Home AFB plays host to a number of visiting combat aircraft detachments each year, including those from allies aboard that come to the base for the open airspace and nearby ranges. A visiting Tornado blasts over the makeshift MOUT complex at the Saylor Creek Range in Southwest Idaho. , USAF The lawsuit states that there are a number of potential hazards presented by the training and says the USAF didn’t do enough to give local communities a heads up about the exercises and to take their input into consideration. The Idaho Press notes that an official Air Force assessment concluded the missions would cause no environmental impact of significance and that a 30-day period in which stakeholders could review the project was part of the plan. Seven meetings with residents of local communities where the training would mainly take place were also held. Still, the suit argues this was too little as not every community that would be impacted was offered a meeting, the 30-day feedback period, or even a formal notice of what would be going on, as just a webpage on Mountain Home AFB’s website explained the plans. The Idaho Press writes: As of Wednesday, the U.S. Air Force has not filed a response in the case, which originated in the U.S. District Court of Idaho, due to the fact that it involves the federal government. An official with the Mountain Home Air Force Base did not return a call seeking comment from the Idaho Press by late Wednesday afternoon. The complaint alleges the Air Force began “conducting project training operations over the urban centers” before the review process was complete, indicating that it had made up its mind beforehand, attorneys wrote in the complaint. We will have to see how all this plays out as it may impact similar potential arrangements in other locales across the United States, especially as the USAF continue to put a greater priority on this type of training. News of this type of exercise is also sure to fire up the conspiracy theorists who look at any urban warfare training as some sort of prelude to the government declaring Martial Law. We will let you know how the USAF responds to the suit when those details come available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 3, 2018",Puerto Rico Air Guard’s C-130 Airlifters And Flying Role Are Being Taken Away,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard, or PRANG, has lost its flying mission less than two years after Hurricane Maria battered its main base and nearly a year after tragic accident exposed a culture of apathy and poor morale. It will now reorganize its former flying units to support the U.S. Air Force’s recent push to revitalize its ability to rapidly deploy and establish forward bases overseas during major crises and conflicts. U.S. Air Force General Joseph L. Lengyel, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, informed Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló of the decision on Apr. 11, 2019. Puerto Rico Air National Guard’s 156th Airlift Wing had formally received a new name, simply 156th Wing, the day before to mark the shift, which will take approximately 36 months to complete. When it reaches full operational capability, the wing will have gained 18 personnel in the process transitioning from flying the WC-130H Hercules “Hurricane Hunter” aircraft converted into airlifters to its new contingency response and combat communications missions . “The Air Force and the Air National Guard are capitalizing on the expertise of PRANG Airmen and Puerto Rico’s strategic location to support federal and territorial mission requests,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General L. Scott Rice, director of the Air National Guard, said in a statement . “The [contingency response and combat communications] missions also provide Puerto Rico’s territorial leadership tremendous resources for territorial emergency response.” President Donald Trump, seated at the head table in a black jacket, sits underneath the wing of one of the 156th’s WC-130Hs, with the serial 65-0968, during a meeting in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. This plane crashed in Georgia in May 2018., Mandel Ngan/Contributor/Getty Images This will be the first time since the Wing first stood up at the 156th Tactical Fighter Group in 1962 that it has not had a flying mission of some kind. The PRANG does not have any other flying squadrons outside of the Wing. This also means Puerto Rico will no longer have any U.S. military fixed-wing aircraft permanently based on the island for the first time in decades. The National Guard Bureau says that the new 156th Wing will be the first unit within the Air National Guard to combine contingency response and combat communications missions together. There are two other contingency response elements in the Guard, most notably Kentucky’s 123rd Contingency Response Group , but these are attached to larger flying units. There are combat communications squadrons in numerous states and territories, but not specifically paired with contingency response elements. The two missions are distinctly related, though. Contingency response units , sometimes referred to as an “ airbase in a box ,” are structured to provide the personnel and resources necessary to rapidly establish air operations at forward locations. Combat communications elements are tasked operating and maintaining communications and data-sharing networks both in and around their home station and, if required, while forward deployed. The Air Force as a whole, to include its Reserve and National Guard elements, has become increasingly concerned about the ability to rapidly deploy and begin conducting operations during a high-end conflict . The service has warned that it may not be well suited to moving into a theater of operations under fire from a major opponent and establishing bases of operation, especially if any existing infrastructure is damaged, destroyed, or otherwise unusable. Members of the 621st Contingency Response Wing move a plywood panel during a training exercise. , USAF There is now a significant emphasis within the Air Force about revitalizing its contingency response and other related capabilities, including expeditionary base defense , civil engineering, explosive ordnance disposal , and more . You can read about these issues and what the Air Force is already doing to mitigate them in much greater detail here . Separately, the ongoing crisis in Venezuela has helped underscore Puerto Rico’s strategic position as a potential staging base for operations in the Caribbean, Central American, and South America. Of course, there remains no hard evidence at present that the U.S. military is actively preparing for an intervention to unseat Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. In addition, as Lieutenant General Rice noted, the contingency response capabilities have significant value outside of war zones, as well. Contingency response units can just as readily open up airports and other facilities in the aftermath of natural disasters and in order to provide aid during humanitarian crises. Among other things , hurricanes regularly come crashing through the Caribbean and the revised 156th Wing would be well positioned to help respond. Air Force combat controllers and other contingency response personnel have taken part in humanitarian relief missions in the region over the years, including multiple trips to Haiti , in particular. This applies to crises inside the United States, as well. Specialized Air Force units, as well as those from other services, were instrumental in reopening Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida after Hurricane Michael struck in October 2018. Similar elements are now on the scene at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska in the aftermath of historic flooding at that immensely strategic facility. A member of the 621st Contingency Response Wing assesses damage at Tyndall Air Force Base in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael in October 2018., USAF Puerto Rico itself is still very much recovering from the devastation that Hurricane Maria wrought on the island in 2017. The island’s National Guard units have been significant contributors in the disaster relief efforts. It is worth noting, of course, that an airlift unit with C-130s, a design capable of rough field operation in austere environments, would also be immensely valuable in any sort of post-disaster situation and this a capability the PRANG has now lost for the foreseeable future. But at the same time, Hurricane Maria and the political battle over the Federal Governments still-ongoing response to that disaster clearly played a significant role in the National Guard Bureau’s decision to strip the PRANG of its flying mission. As of April 2018, the plan was still for the 156th to continue with its airlift mission using newer C-130H2 Hercules, according to an Air Force report . The readiness and general capability of the 156th Airlift Wing had already been in decline for years, too. In 1998, what was then known as the 156th Fighter Wing traded its F-16A/B fighter jets for C-130E Hercules cargo aircraft, becoming the 156th Airlift Wing in the process. The first E model Hercules entered service in the early 1960s and by the early 2000s they had become increasingly hard to maintain. A Puerto Rico Air National Guard C-130E, serial number 64-0510 in 2007. The “64” in the serial number refers to the fiscal year in which the U.S. Air Force had first bought this plane., USAF When the 156th retired the C-130Es in 2012, it was one of the last units still operating the type. To keep it flying, the Air Force shifted six WC-130Hs to the unit from the Tennessee Air National Guard. The problem here was that these aircraft were configured primarily as Hurricane Hunters, a mission you can read about in more detail here , and were not combat coded. The 156th never assumed a Hurricane Hunting mission, despite having these aircraft. Since they weren’t combat coded, the planes had also not received a variety of upgrades added to regular C-130H airlifters over the years. So, though the WC-130Hs arrived stripped of their weather reconnaissance equipment and configured for the cargo carrying mission, these planes were never capable of fully performing the wing’s main airlift job. Bags belonging to the U.S. Air Force Academy’s ice hockey team sit on the rear ramp of one of the 156th’s WC-130Hs in 2016 during a decidedly non-combat airlift mission to bring the players and their gear back from a game in Rochester, New York., USAF A plan in 2016 to convert the 156th to an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance unit flying the RC-26B Condor, a plane you can read more about in detail here , collapsed. The following year, Hurricane Maria struck the island, dealing significant damage Muñiz Air National Guard Base. The facilities at Muñiz were already old and neglected to begin with, which only further reduced the unit’s readiness and continued to fuel a growing culture of apathy. This all came to a head on May 2, 2018 , when one of the 156th’s WC-130Hs crashed near Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia, killing all nine individuals on board. The Air Force’s subsequent investigation determined that the crash was the result of problems with one of the engines followed by a series of human errors that led to a stall and a loss of control that sent the plane plummeting into Georgia State Highway 21. In addition, the report slammed the 156th for lax maintenance practices and what it described as “good enough” attitude. Firefighters spray water or foam on the wreckage of one of the 156th Airlift Wing’s WC-130Hs, serial number 65-0968, after it crashed in Georgia in May 2018., Steve Bisson/Savannah Morning News via AP But the review also shone a light on the apathy and poor morale of a unit that officially had a combat mission, but had no combat-coded aircraft, and was making do with inadequate facilities, chronic logistical problems, and the aftermath of Maria. The WC-130H that crashed was heading to retirement at the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and was one of the oldest Hercules of any kind still in service at the time. “Airmen have no direct connection to a Mission other than maintaining current and qualified aircrews,” the Air Force’s investigators noted. “Rather than being a source of pride and excellence, the concept of a Citizen Airman was twisted into an excuse of, ‘I am just a TR’ (Traditional Reservist).” The accident seemed to have finally ended the Wing’s prospects for a continued flying mission, at least for the immediate future, capping off decades of decline and neglect. Hopefully, with a new, clear mission, the 156th will now be able to regain its footing in the coming years. But at the same time, the loss of organic airlift capability of any kind for the U.S. Territory is another crushing blow in a long line of hits the Island has taken during and after Maria tore through almost 20 months ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 16, 2018",USAF Secretary Gives Ominous Warning That Show Of Force Needed To Deter Space Attacks,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Outgoing Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson says the United States may need to conduct a show of force to deter opponents, such as Russia and China, from attacking U.S. military satellites in space . But it wasn’t entirely clear whether this would involve demonstrating the ability to attack an adversary’s own space assets only or if it would even show an ability or willingness to attack hostile space-based systems at all. This cuts to a larger issue, that no one really knows for sure what a war in space would actually look like, though the United States is certainly working to answer that question. Wilson offered her view on the future of potential conflict in space to reporters on the sidelines of the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium, which began on Apr. 8, 2019. Other Air Force and U.S. officials have also used the event as an opportunity to highlight the very real and growing threats to vital satellites that support critical military capabilities, such as long-distance communications , navigation , weapon guidance , early warning , ballistic missile defense , and intelligence gathering . Defending those assets has been an increasingly hot topic in recent years and President Donald Trump’s administration has gone so far as to propose the creation of a sixth military branch, the Space Force , to focus on these issues. “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence,” Wilson said, according to The Daily Beast . “That capability needs to be one that’s understood by your adversary,” she added, according to Air Force Magazine . “They need to know there are certain things we can do, at least at some broad level, and the final element of deterrence is uncertainty. How confident are they that they know everything we can do? Because there’s a risk calculation in the mind of an adversary.” Wilson wasn’t the only one to warn that the United States might retaliate forcefully in response to an attack on U.S. military space-based systems. “It’s not enough to stand in the ring and take punches. You have to have the will and capability to punch back,” U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein also said at the Space Symposium . Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, to her immediate right, at the Space Foundation’s 35th annual Space Symposium. , USAF As The War Zone has pointed out on multiple occasions , the threats to U.S. military space assets are very real. The U.S. military’s historical advantages in space-based capabilities and its increasing reliance thereon has long made them attractive targets to potential adversaries, such as Russia and China. Most recently, there have been reports that China may be working on ground-based laser weapons to blind or otherwise disrupt optical systems on U.S. satellites, including ones tasked with missile warning and intelligence gathering missions. On Apr. 9, 2019 , at the Space Symposium, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said that the United States is of the opinion that the Chinese will have an operational anti-satellite laser capability by 2020. A report from the Defense Intelligence Agency in February 2019 said that China may be able to actually damage or destroy a satellite with a laser system by the mid-2020s. In December 2018 , Russia announced that they had put a ground-based laser system, called Peresvet , into service. The Russians claim this system could have an anti-satellite role and also say they are developing an aerial anti-satellite laser system . This is to say nothing of the various anti-satellite interceptors and potential small “ killer satellites ” Russia and China have also deployed. In March 2019, India demonstrated its ability to shoot down a satellite , which shows that these capabilities are only proliferating. Secretary Wilson declined to say what specific offensive capabilities the United States might employ as deterrents against attacks on U.S. military satellites, or if it had any such systems in place now. In February 2019, the Air Force did wrap up a four-month study into the issue, according to Air Force Magazine . “We looked at all of our missions in space, from missile warning to communications and intelligence collection,” Wilson said at the Space Symposium. “We took the best estimates of the threat and presumed a thinking adversary who would respond to the actions that we take.” A general overview of the potential threats to US satellites posed by offensive “killer satellites.” Ground-based threats down on Earth can also include jamming, laser and other directed energy attacks, and hard-kill interceptors., DIA This process involved thousands of wargames and at least 25 tabletop exercises involving not only Air Force personnel, but individuals from other military branches, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ). These exercises also included simulated means of mitigating the threats, including the use of disaggregated constellations of hundreds or potentially thousands of small commercial satellites to make it more difficult for an opponent to swat down an entire network. Air Force Secretary Wilson has suggested that the results did not reflect favorably on this idea, which the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the newly minted Space Development Agency have been keen to promote. While we don’t know what responses the U.S. military might already have or be considering, we do know that it has demonstrated its ability to shoot down a satellite with an air-launched interceptor in 1985 and with a surface-launched missile in 2008. The latter event was known as Operation Burnt Frost. In 1997, it also conducted a test of a ground-based laser weapon that may have at least blinded or otherwise temporarily disrupted the optics on a target satellite. The U.S. military also has a congressional mandate at present to be developing space-based missile defense systems . Many of the concepts on the table now would have an inherent anti-satellite capability . But officially, the United States does not have an anti-satellite system deployed and it has never described any past developments and experiments as offensive in any way, despite their obvious potential applications. Of course, neither Wilson nor Goldfein specifically said that any potential retaliatory attacks would have to be limited to targets in space, or necessary include them at all. An American response to an attack in space could include conventional strikes, or even potentially nuclear ones if the damage done to U.S. space-based systems were to have sufficiently severe impacts on the ability of the United States to continue functioning as normal . There could be non-kinetic options, as well, including offensive cyber attacks . Either kinetic or non-kientic options could be focused specifically on disabiling an opponents ability to control their own space-based systems. This all leads to the bigger question of what conflict, or even in isolated attack, looks like in space and what a proportional response would be if one were to erupt. What kind of attack prompts what level of retaliation? Is an opponent temporarily disrupting a satellite’s operation enough to warrant a kinetic response? What if an adversary destroys a top-secret satellite the very existence of which is classified? What if that was a weapon you hadn’t publicly acknowledged you already had? What if you can’t tell where the attack came from or who is responsible ? This 1960s US Army concept area showing troops fighting on the Moon with futuristic space guns won’t be what an actual modern conflict in space looks like any time soon., US Army These are hardly new questions. “It’s really difficult to go ahead and justify how you might attack somebody’s homeland if they’ve taken out a satellite that you don’t even admit exists,” Douglas Loverro, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, said during a talk in 2016 . “Is jamming an attack? Is a laser an attack? Does it have to be a kinetic hit on a satellite to be an attack?” “None of us actually know how a war – if and when it extends to space – will actually evolve, where and what phase will it happen, when will it happen in the conflict, how will it be engineered, we don’t know any of that,” he continued. “It’s difficult politically, it’s difficult emotionally. Probably people are going to die on the ground where nobody’s going to die in space.” Actually destroying something in space in a retaliatory strike may not even be a realistic option. Blowing up a satellite can only create a cloud of extremely fast flying debris that is impossible to control and could threaten other friendly military and civilian space assets, as well as enemy targets. The world is grappling with that particular issue right now in the aftermath of India’s anti-satellite interceptor test. The debris field from that event presents a serious threat to objects in low earth orbit and may not fully dissipate for up to 18 months . Of course, there are various ways to disable a satellite without necessarily creating a ton of dangerous space junk. Small, highly maneuverable “ killer satellites ” might be able to use manipulator arms to deorbit a target so that it simply burns up in the atmosphere or just damage key components without breaking any significant parts off in the process. A laser or another type of directed energy weapon could similarly render a satellite non-functional without having to shatter it. The goal has to be to “ensure an attack on space has no benefit to our adversaries,” Loverro said. “At the end of the day, what really deters people from going ahead and attacking the U.S. is the notion that the U.S. can bring the other domains into a conflict and defeat any aggression that we may see against the United States.” But Wilson’s and Goldfein’s comments now seem to suggest something in that calculus has changed. The recent wargaming and tabletop exercises may have at least indicated that the threat of some tertiary action may not be enough to actually deter an opponent from launching an attack on U.S. assets in space, or thinking they might be able to get away with something short of completely destroying a satellite. What is clear is that space is becoming an increasingly dangerous place and that the U.S. military wants to make clear that it will not take threats to its assets there lightly. What an American show of force – or an actual hostile act in space its meant to deter – might look like remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2019",You Can Buy The State Department’s Totally Upgraded S-61T Helicopters That It Barely Used,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you’re in the market for a baker’s dozen of refurbished Sikorsky S-61T helicopters , the U.S. State Department will happily sell you the ones it has sitting in a hangar in southern Florida. The State Department had originally planned to buy more than 100 of these choppers to move diplomats and other personnel in high-risk areas , such as Afghanistan . Delays and other issues left it with a fleet of less than 20, most of which went straight into storage. The General Services Administration (GSA) is already auctioning off the first five S-61Ts – with the U.S. civil registration numbers N107WK, N122WU, N375WS, N575AW, and N898WC – each of which has a starting bid price of $500,000. This does not meet an unspecified reserve price for a final sale, though. The State Department plans to sell its remaining fleet of these helicopters, 13 in total, via GSA within six months, according to the Department’s Press Relations Office. “There is no longer a State Department mission requirement for them,” the State Department told The War Zone in a statement via Email. “These specific aircraft will not be replaced.” The S-61Ts were refurbished ex-U.S. Navy and NASA SH-3 Sea Kings , which were themselves military variants of the S-61 series. The Sea King has been all but retired from U.S. military service for years now. The U.S. Marine Corps is still using heavily modified VH-3D Sea Kings , more commonly known as Marine Ones, to shuttle around the President of the United States, their family, and their closest advisors, but is planning on replacing them with new VH-92As over the next four years. A Sikorsky S-61T demonstrator., Sikorsky The State Department S-61Ts were based on donor airframes that came straight from Navy. That service had retired the bulk of its Sea Kings in the 1990s, but did continue using them in very limited numbers into the late-2000s . The State Department obtained other SH-3s from the Bone Yard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The very last of Navy’s SH-3s had originally rolled off of Sikorsky’s production line in the 1970s, though many did receive significant upgrades in the decades that followed. Sikorsky developed the S-61T conversion process with Carson Helicopters , which involved a major overhaul of the airframes, as well as the addition of significant upgrades. The updates included a new main rotor assembly with five Carson composite material blades, a glass cockpit, improved avionics and other mission systems, and modular wiring assemblies to rapidly install additional systems per the customer’s request. The State Department had agreed to purchase up to 110 S-61Ts when it signed its contract with Sikorsky in 2010. The specific requirements for the Air Wing’s helicopters included adding missile approach warning sensors, decoy flare launchers, added armor for the crew, and provisions for door-mounted GAU-17/A Miniguns . A side-by-side comparison of an older-model SH-3 Sea King or commercial S-61 cockpit, at left, and the glass cockpit found on the S-61T., Carson Helicopters At the time, the deal, which was potentially worth up to $1.675 billion and also included purchases of a number of refurbished short- and long-fuselage commercial S-61N helicopters with similar upgrades, was seen a major win for the Connecticut-headquartered helicopter maker. The company hoped that the sales to the State Department would help promote the S-61T upgrade package to additional customers, as well. The exact unit price that the State Department ultimately paid for each of the helicopters it acquired is unclear. Carson had previously upgraded a number of late-model Navy SH-3s with its composite blades and new avionics at a cost of around $3.5 million per chopper. Whatever the case, the cost was undoubtedly significantly higher than the $500,000 starting bid in the current GSA auctions. The State Department planned for these choppers to primarily support the operations of its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs’ Office of Aviation, also known as INL/A or the State Department Air Wing, in Afghanistan. To this day, the Air Wing runs a shuttle service called Embassy Air with five-minute flights between Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport and the U.S. Embassy. The Air Wing, which has more than 200 aircraft and helicopters of various types in total, also performs a number of other missions in Afghanistan, as well as other sites around the world, and runs a similar Embassy Air service in Iraq and Jordan. You can read about these various missions in more detail here and here . The first S-61T for the State Department makes its maiden flight in 2014. This helicopter, N898WC, is among those that GSA is already auctioning off., Sikorsky But for reasons that largely remain unclear, the State Department encountered significant delays in acquiring the S-61Ts. In 2013 , there were difficulties in getting the improved avionics package, which Sikorsky obtained through Cobham, certified with the Federal Aviation Administration. That same year , Carson suffered a major scandal when Levi Phillips, its head of maintenance at the time, plead guilty to fraud over an accident in 2008 in which one of its S-61Ns crashed in California, killing a U.S. Forest Service official and seven firefighters. A Carson Helicopter S-61 with an aerial firefighting conversion dumps its payload of water., Carson Helicopters The operator’s manual Carson had supplied had false weight and takeoff power data. As part of his plea deal, Philipps subsequently testified against the company’s Vice President, Steven Metheny. In 2015 , Metheny went to prison over the crash. Whatever the exact issues were in acquiring the S-61Ts, by 2014, the State Department had still not taken delivery of a single one of the helicopters, though it had received 16 refurbished S-61Ns. By the next year , the Air Wing had finally obtained 15 S-61Ts, but 10 of them were sitting idle in storage at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Of the other five, two were flying Air Wing missions from Cyprus, while the other three were deployed in Iraq. To the best of our knowledge, none of them ever went to Afghanistan, though the S-61Ns did. An Air Wing S-61N circa 2013., US Department of State “It should be noted that the acquisition of helicopters for Iraq and Afghanistan was not without a documented cost benefit analysis, but options were limited due to time constraints for fielding the aircraft,” INL told the State Department’s Inspector General during an audit of all its aircraft fleets, which came out in September 2018. “It was only later that excess DoD CH-46 aircraft became available and were obtained and employed due to delays in S-61 production and delivery. Once CH-46s were fielded, they proved to be better suited for the Afghanistan environment which led to eventual disposal of the S-61N helicopters.” The Air Wing’s CH-46Es came from the U.S. Marine Corps, which had replaced them with MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors. These helicopters are still in service in Afghanistan, including in the Embassy Air role in Kabul. This also explains why the State Department is divesting them without a direct replacement. It already had helicopters filling the roles the S-61Ts were supposed to perform. An Air Wing CH-46E in Afghanistan., Dan Stern However, “the Department is acquiring some used UH-60 helicopters from the Department of Defense to replace other existing aging helicopters that are in service,” State Department’s Press Office noted in its statement. As of September 2018, the Air Wing had 22 Black Hawks, which it had obtained via the U.S. Army’s Black Hawk Exchange and Sales Team program, or BEST . Private companies have also been scooping these up , too. Contractors are working to refurbish and upgrade the Air Wing’s UH-60s, as well as those still in Army service, to include things such as glass cockpits and improved avionics, as well. It will be interesting to see who might be willing to take the remaining S-61Ts off of the State Department’s hands. There are a number of private companies still operating various S-61 series helicopters, including Carson, which could be interested in acquiring the choppers. Existing S-61 operators use these choppers to support offshore oil operations, for VIP transport duties, and aerial firefighting, among other jobs. The prospect of acquiring additional, like-new S-61Ts with additional upgrades, could be very attractive, especially if the final sale price remains relatively low. If you are interested in picking up any of the former State Department helicopters, you can place bids on any of the five on auction now through April 18, 2019.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 6, 2019","The U.S. Navy Has Unveiled A New Hydrofoil, Its First In Decades","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy has at least tested small hydrofoil boat based on the VT Halter Marine Mk Mod 2 High Speed Assault Craft, a predecessor to the service’s stealthy Combatant Craft Assault special operations watercraft, or CCA. The revelation comes more than 25 years after the service retired its six Pegasus -class missile boats, the last of its operational hydrofoils. The existence of the hydrofoil design first emerged in a video that the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, or NSWC Carderock, posted on YouTube on Mar. 12, 2019. A clip showing the small boat moving at high speed is part of a larger montage of clips of the center’s work attached to the Navy’s “ Forged by the Sea ” recruitment commercial. There is no narration to the Carderock clips or other descriptions of the systems shown, but the craft in question is clearly based on the VT Halter Marine design , if not a direct hydrofoil conversion of one of these high-speed special operations craft. The standard Mk Mod 2 High Speed Assault Craft is just under 40 feet long with a hull primarily made of kevlar and a pair of high-performance engines. The hydrofoil is seen in the video below at around 2:27 in the runtime, if it doesn’t forward you automatically. Carderock, which is situated in Maryland along the Potomac River, specializes a variety of ship design fields, including hullforms and radar and other signature reduction. The center’s work has included experimental ships such as the Advanced Electric Ship Demonstrator (AESD), also known as the Sea Jet , which is a functional quarter-scale model of a DDG-1000 Zumwalt -class stealth destroyer. The full video also includes clips of testing of other subscale ship and submarine design models, including experiments with a hullform similar to that of the M80 Stiletto experimental stealth boat. We don’t know how many hydrofoil derivatives of the Mk Mod 2 the Navy has, or had, or if this is, or was, part of a more extensive program to develop a new special operations boat. At the time of writing, Carderock had not yet responded to The War Zone ’s queries about this design. Mk Mod 2 composite combat craft. , Ebay The Navy appears to have largely replaced the Mk Mod 2s in operational units with the newer CCA, which is a stealthy 41-foot long boat with a composite material hull and two engines, which you can read about in more depth here . The service acquired these boats from U.S. Marine, Inc. as a follow-on to the earlier High-Speed Assault Craft. VT Halter Marine and U.S. Marine had collaborated on projects during the 1980s , including the Mk V Special Operations Craft (SOC), before parting ways. In 2014, a disused and hard-worn Mk Mod 2 even sold on eBay. A Combatant Craft Assault (CCA)., USN There are some of the Mk Mod 2s still in service, however, and they are still available for training purposes . The boats most recently turned up at an exercise off the coast of Miami, Florida that The War Zone was first to report on and appeared to involve members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). If the Mk Mod 2s are indeed largely or completely out of front-line service, they would be ideal platforms for experimental projects. A hydrofoil high-speed assault boat could definitely offer Navy special operators certain advantages. A standard Mk Mod 2 in the Port of Miami during a training exercise in December 2018., Owen from Miami Hydrofoils use wing-like structures underneath the hull to lift the hull out of the water and “fly” above it. This reduces drag that ships would otherwise experience if they had to cut through the water during traditional “hull-borne” sailing. As a result, hydrofoils are generally faster and often have better fuel economy than similarly-sized traditional designs. They can also offer added stability, even in rougher sea states, since they’re sailing above the waves, rather than crashing through them. It also largely eliminates the skipping motion common in many other high-speed boat designs, such as the CCA itself, which can be extremely hard on crew and passengers, especially during extended duration missions. This same elevated position can offer added protection against shallow-water mines and other hazards, too. There are two general design categories of these ships, one involving what are known as surface-piercing foils and another using so-called fully-submerged foils. Surface-piercing refers to the fact that these designs generally have foils that remain partially above the water. Surface-piercing is the simpler of the two general configurations and is more common on commercial hydrofoils, but it can still produce significant drag due to the size of the foils. Fully-submerged foils are typically smaller and offer improved performance. A very basic overview of the two different general categories of hydrofoil., Wikimedia During the 1960s and 1970s, the Navy experimented extensively with a number of surface-piercing and fully-submerged hydrofoil designs. The service even sent two prototype gunboat designs with fully-submerged foils, the Grumman-built USS Flagstaff and Boeing-made USS Tucumcari , for trials during the Vietnam War. The Navy also had a number of experimental hydrofoil craft, primarily with fully submerged foils, including the USS Plainview . Lockheed delivered this ship in 1969, which at the time was the largest hydrofoil in the world with a displacement of more than 300 tons. Flagstaff , Tucumcari , and Plainview , among others, are seen in the video below. While we don’t know the performance specifications of the standard Mk Mod 2, Carderock’s hydrofoil derivative, which is a fully-submerged design, could have significantly better speed and range than its traditional counterpart, as well as improved capabilities on the open ocean. The Navy’s missions for the newer CCAs include inserting and extracting special operators, as well as conducting discreet coastal surveillance missions, according to an official briefing . They have also been employed as stealthy platforms to deliver teams to board larger ships . In recent years, the existing stealthy speed boats have appeared in the Middle East , off the coast of the Horn of Africa , and in the Pacific Region . With greater speed and range, a hydrofoil fast assault craft could be more flexible, especially during short-notice extraction missions. The CCAs also operate from motherships, such as the secretive M/V Ocean Trader , which could use hydrofoils instead to launch missions from a point further away from shore, potentially reducing the possibility of detection and the risk of counterattack. Once the craft got closer to shore, the crew could revert to hull-borne operation and close the final distance in a low-profile, reduced-signature mode. They could also remain in the foil-borne configuration to better navigate shallow littoral environments or those where there might be an elevated threat of mines or other hazards. But there are potential disadvantages, too. Surface-piercing hydrofoils are typically “self-righting,” meaning that the ship will remain stable even if there is a sudden loss of speed and lift that leads to a “crash landing” of sorts.  In contrast, fully-submerged foils require constant attention from the crew, usually with the help of a complex computerized control system, to maintain stability. Beyond that, fully-submerged hydrofoils often have two sets of propulsion systems, one for hull-borne and foil-borne operation, which can make them even more complicated and labor-intensive to maintain. This generally involves propellers or water jets at the base of the main foil, in addition to a traditional propulsion arrangement. Hydrofoils can sometimes have trouble operating in shallower harbors and inshore areas in the hull-borne mode. The designs often include mechanisms to swing the foils out of the water during hull-borne operation, further adding to the overall complexity. Even with retractable foils, air-dropping a hydrofoil CCA derivative, something that boat is capable of in its present form, would probably be a challenge. USS Flagstaff with her foils in the stowed position., National Museum of the U.S. Navy This all makes hydrofoils more expensive as a result, too. The costs involved have made building hydrofoils above a certain size largely impractical. As noted with Plainview , even larger military examples are exponentially smaller than traditional warships, typically being in the size range of conventional gunboats and missile boats. These realities colored much of the Navy’s previous experiences with hydrofoils. The service quickly withdrew Flagstaff and Tucumcari from South Vietnam because they were too complex for maintenance facilities there. In 1972, Tucumcari hit a coral reef off the coast of Puerto Rico during a test, sheering off the main foils and injuring multiple members of her crew. The ship was so badly lodged in the reef that salvage teams tried to free her by using explosives to break up the coral, but this only further damaged the ship. The Navy formally struck the ship from its rolls in 1973 and sold it for scrap. The USS Tucumcari stranded on a coral reef off Puerto Rico in 1972., USN Flagstaff served longer, including a stint on loan to the U.S. Coast Guard, but headed to the scrap yard itself in 1978. Plainview met the same fate that year. These ships did serve as a stepping stone to the Navy’s plans for a more robust hydrofoil force. In the late 1960s, it had joined with its NATO counterparts in Germany and Italy to develop a hydrofoil missile boat. The service envisioned the ships dashing out to strike Soviet surface vessels in the North Sea and Baltic Sea with Harpoon anti-ship missiles . Boeing received the final contract to design what became the Pegasus -class . These ships displaced around 237 tons and each had a 76mm main gun and could carry up to eight Harpoons. The German examples were to have come equipped with the French-designed Exocet anti-ship missile , instead. But Germany and Italy eventually dropped out of the program, while other potential partners, including the United Kingdom and Canada, declined to join the effort. The Navy, which had planned to buy as many as 30 of the new Pegasus -class ships from Boeing, ultimately purchased just six. The first-in-class USS Pegasus ., USN Pegasus and her sisters instead went to Key West, where they primarily spent their service searching for drug runners in the Caribbean. The ships, which could reach top speeds up to 55 miles per hour and had a range of at least 750 miles , were well suited to chasing down smugglers’ speed boats. In 1993, the Navy retired all six of the hydrofoil missile boats, the first of which had entered service in 1977. Now, more than two decades later, Carderock’s hydrofoil Mk Mod 2 derivative might be a sign of renewed interest of the hydrofoil concept within the Navy, in general. All six Pegasus-class hydrofoil missile boats sail in formation ahead of their decommissioning in 1993., USN Author’s note: NSWC Carderock took down the original video for unknown reasons and a copy is now in its place in this story.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 30, 2019",Japanese F-35A Has Gone Missing Over The Pacific Ocean (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain extremely limited at this time, but there are reports from Japanese media outlets stating that one of the Japan Air Self Defense Force’s F-35As has gone missing during an evening training mission off Northern Japan. A search effort is supposedly now underway. Reports state that the F-35 went missing at around 7:30pm local time on the 9th of April, 2019. The aircraft had taken off from Misawa Air Base and was around 85 miles east of that location, over the Pacific Ocean, when it disappeared from Japan’s tracking systems. That’s what we have as of now and keep in mind that these are media reports, not official statements. So, these details could change dramatically in the coming hours. Let’s hope they do. Japan just stood up its first operational F-35A squadron days ago at Misawa Air Base and is currently the largest foreign customer for the aircraft with an inventory of 147 of the jets planned. As it sits now, Japan’s orders will include 42 F-35Bs for its Izumo class carriers . The rest will be F-35As. For a number of reasons , the F-35A represents a huge capability boost for the JASDF. JASDF There has only been one in-flight loss of an F-35, that aircraft was an F-35B that crashed near MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina in September of last year. We will update this piece as more details come available. Update: 5:45am PDT— Japan Times has confirmed that the jet went missing with the Defense Ministry, stating: “The Defense Ministry said Tuesday that an Air Self-Defense Force F-35A fighter disappeared from radar over the Pacific Ocean. The fighter jet vanished from radar east of Aomori Prefecture at 7:27 p.m., the ministry said, adding that it is still confirming the details.” Update: 6:30am PDT— The F-35 was part of a four-ship flight that departed Misawa around the same time and were training in the area together. There is still no word as to the status of the pilot. There are some vessels in the area that could be assisting in the search and rescue efforts: Update: 8:00am PDT— Nothing new to report aside from the fact that Japan has halted all F-35 flights for the time being, but here are some thoughts I just posted on Twitter that I think should be shared here as well: “If one of Japan’s F-35s is sitting at the bottom of the Pacific, we are probably about to see one of the biggest underwater espionage and counter-espionage ops since the Cold War. If it was operating without its radar reflectors pinpointing where it went in may be an issue. If it was data linked via MADL [the F-35’s proprietary low-probability of intercept data-linl] with other F-35s, their data could help a lot in finding it. I have no clue how the black box works on this jet, anyone have info on if it pings? If it’s really deep that could be a vulnerability. Expect ASW [anti-submarine warfare] umbrella in crash area.” Also, some have asked about the possibility of defection. We have zero info that would point to such a thing happening and it would be less plausible if the F-35 was wearing its radar deflectors. So, at this point, it is possible albeit highly improbable. Such an event would have huge geopolitical ramifications, as well, which may far outweigh the strategic benefit of being able to invasively examine an F-35. Also, so much of the program’s intellectual property was stolen by the Chinese that acquiring the real thing may not be as extensively valued as some would think. It would still be a huge intelligence and technological coup, but would it offset the negative repercussions that would come from it? The F-35’s F135 engine would most likely be the most valuable component for Beijing. Russia would probably be a different case as they lag behind China in stealth technology and we have not heard that they pilfered the program’s secrets via cyber espionage operations like China did. Also, the geopolitical situation between the U.S. and Russia is a bit different than the one between the U.S. and China. Update: 11:25am PDT— There is still nothing major to report, but Lockheed has acknowledged the incident: Update: 6:40pm PDT— Search and rescue vessels have found the wreckage of the F-35 in the water. There is still no word on the pilot. Japan Times writes : “A section of the missing fighter’s tail was found and retrieved from the sea late Tuesday night about 135 km off the coast of the Air Self-Defense Force’s Misawa Air Base in Aomori, a ministry official said.

The F-35A lost radar contact approximately 85 miles east of Misawa Air Base. A P-8A joined JASDF aircraft and Japan Maritime Self Defense Force ships searching the area overnight. Additional flights are continuing today. Guided-missile destroyer USS Stethem (DDG 63) is sailing to the search area now. U.S. 7th Fleet provides security alongside allies and partners throughout a free and open Indo-Pacific. As the U.S. Navy’s largest forward-deployed fleet, 7th Fleet operates roughly 50-70 ships and submarines and 140 aircraft with approximately 20,000 Sailors. The P-8A aircraft are assigned to Patrol Squadron (VP) 8 and Patrol Squadron (VP) 5. Both squadrons are homeported in Jacksonville, Fla. and are on rotational deployments to 7th Fleet out of Misawa, Japan. Stethem is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, Japan. The wreckage likely sits at a depth of around 5,000 feet, which will make recovering it challenging.

The jet had been airborne for around half an hour when it went down. Supposedly, there was no warning at all from the pilot that something had gone wrong. A call was made to stop training by another pilot sometime around when the aircraft went down. The pilot was in his 40s was highly experienced, but was still somewhat new to the F-35.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There appears to be a large-scale military exercise underway across Nevada and Utah. In the dead of night, a variety of U.S. surveillance and support aircraft have popped up over and around Las Vegas and Dugway Proving Ground west of Salt Lake City. The most interesting of the lot is a U-2 Dragon Lady serial number 68-10366, which is based out of Plant 42 in Palmdale, California and is normally used to test new U-2 payloads and configurations. The U-2 has been flying long tracks that cross over South Las Vegas for hours at an altitude of 60,000 feet. This is not a common flight profile for any U-2. In addition to the Dragon Lady, an EC-130 Compass Call —the USAF’s only dedicated electronic warfare platform—is lingering northwest of Las Vegas. An RC-135V Rivet Joint electronic and communications intelligence collection aircraft is also flying to the north of Las Vegas.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 22, 2019",USAF Reveals Timelines And Basing Plans For Its Huge Adversary Support Contract,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has unveiled a number of different possible schedules for when it will award contracts under a multi-billion dollar plan to hire private companies to act as “red air” adversaries and help train U.S. military fighter pilots at a dozen different bases across the United States. The new information has emerged as one firm, Draken International , continues to secure interim contracts, setting it up to be a major competitor for the larger deal. Air Combat Command, which oversees the bulk of the Air Force’s active duty combat-coded aircraft, released details about what it called the “Operating Location (OL) Laydown” on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, on June 5, 2018. Under the different schedules, the Air Force will award the first of multiple contracts, with unspecified values, in July 2019. It will sign the final deals as part of this adversary air, or ADAIR , program between 2020 and 2021. On June 1, 2018, the Pentagon also announced that the Air Force had awarded Draken a $280 million contract to continue providing training services for the 57th Adversary Tactics Group at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, as well as Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Some of the firm’s L-159E Honey Badger aircraft touched down at Kingsley Field in Oregon as part of a separate deal to support the Oregon Air National Guard’s 173rd Fighter Wing on June 3, 2018. The 173rd is the USAF sole F-15C/D Eagle training unit. The Air Force’s goal for the upcoming larger, more comprehensive contracting arrangement is to have a single overarching deal to meet its needs for contractor support during both air-to-air and air-to-ground training. In the latter cases, a private company would supply aircraft to conduct mock air strikes to help train Joint Tactical Air Controllers (JTAC) and Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP). The service reportedly expects to spend up to $7.5 billion between 2019 and 2029 on the complete ADAIR program, which could see contractors fly between 30,000 and 37,000 flight hours in total with an unspecified number of aircraft. A pair of Draken International L-159E Honey Badgers., Draken International But it seems highly unlikely that just one contractor will have the aircraft, personnel, and overall operational capacity to meet the Air Force’s total requirements, which includes training services at 11 sites in the contiguous United States and at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. The new contracting documents further suggest that the service will award smaller “task order” contracts on a base-by-base basis within the larger “indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity” (IDIQ) deal that could go to multiple vendors. The question then becomes who gets ADAIR support and when and how the Air Force plans to pay for the services. The service says it will decide the final timeline based on the offers it gets from companies, the results of environmental impact studies in line with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), how much funding Congress decides to allocate for the project, and other factors as determined by its own senior leadership. The Air Force has put together four schedules it says are “likely” and which are “based on constraints on the program known as of 1 Jun[e] 2018,” according to the recent contracting notice. “Actual fielding is subject to change at any time, including after the IDIQ is awarded.” The full list of possible courses of action to award the ADAIR contracts., USAF Two of the proposed plans involve Air Combat Command paying out of its particular budget lines, while the other two would see funding come from the Air Force’s more centralized accounts. Each pairing includes one “slow” and one “rapid” concept for handing out the ADAIR program contracts. They all involve a total of 12 contract awards for training services at separate operating locations, but there are no prospective values for the individual deals to help indicate which ones might involve more complex requirements than others. You can see the full schedules below: The four proposed schedules, plus ACC’s priority list. , USAF The slower potential plans exist because of concerns that the bases in question may not be able to physically handle the extra aircraft and support the increased operational and logistical strains from the extra sorties and other activity. The Air Force makes clear that the faster timelines will only work at all if it can secure the funding it needs to quickly expand the capacity at the different operating locations. Any one of these plans would, of course, also be entirely dependent on how many aircraft a company says it has to deploy and for how long to meet the service’s demands. Beyond that, the main difference between the two sets of plans is the order in which bases would get private contractors and their aircraft. The courses of action where Air Combat Command pays by itself are both slower overall, but would better meet the command’s priorities for ADAIR support, at least according to the contracting notice. The schedules that involve funding straight from the Air Force’s top echelons may move faster, but focus on bases the service thinks would be able to complete their NEPA reviews more quickly. It’s not entirely clear how this could be the case based on the information provided, though. The “NEPA” plans both match up better overall with Air Combat Command’s priority listing, with the exception of the contract for Nellis Air Force Base. In one of these proposals that base, which is the number one priority, gets pushed all the way to the bottom of the schedule. Draken International already supplies adversary support to the base under a separate contract with A-4 Skyhawks and L-159 Honey Badgers being fixtures on the base’s huge apron for years now. But that capability would likely drastically increase under this expanded deal. The idea that Nellis, which already manages a number of expansive aerial training ranges , would have more difficulty than any other site in fulfilling any additional NEPA requirements seems curious at best. Furthermore, the Air Combat Command-funded plans that are supposed to be more in line with its priorities would send ADAIR contractors first to bases it lists seventh and eighth on the priority list out of 12. A map showing the Nellis Air Force Range and the Nevada Test Site with Nellis Air Force marked in the lower righthand corner outside Las Vegas., Finlay McWalter via Wikimedia There is a fifth option to just follow Air Combat Command’s priorities in sequence. The Air Force does not offer a timeframe for how long it would take to award all the necessary contracts in that case. Regardless of these discrepancies, under both of the two Air Combat Command-sponsored proposals, the Air Force would award the first contract, for training services at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, in July 2019. If the service chooses the slower version of this plan, it would sign the last deal in July 2021. The faster iteration of plan pushes that date up to September 2020. Hill Air Force Base, which has the lowest priority, would be the final recipient in either case. The NEPA timelines also have the same start July 2019 start date, but wrap up a month earlier in both the slow and fast scenarios. However, they award contracts in the intervening period at a significantly more expedited rate. With unrestricted funding, the Air Force says it could have five deals already signed by the end of 2019 by following the NEPA-focused schedule. An F-5E Tiger II aircraft belonging to TacAir, another company vying for the Air Force’s ADAIR contracts., TacAir Whichever schedule the Air Force decides to proceed with for the contracts, the demand for ADAIR, especially for air-to-air training, is already pronounced and only likely to continue growing. As I wrote back in December 2017 : “For more than two decades, the adversary air industry had been slowly expanding, especially in the United States. This has accelerated as the Pentagon has faced budget caps and cuts, as well as a shrinking overall force size and a worn out fleet of 4th generation fighter jets,  limiting the amount of personnel and aircraft individual services can dedicate to the aggressor role itself. “This is only likely to become more pronounced as the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy acquire more fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , something The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has written about extensively over the years . It is simply not going to be cost effective to have 5th generations fighters flying as adversaries, especially for basic training duties. As for dedicated adversary units within the Pentagon’s portfolio, funds to expand the number of squadrons focused on this mission even with fourth generation aircraft is unlikely to materialize. This is especially problematic because 5th generation fighters need greater adversary capacity to train against in order to challenge their pilots. “The Air Force in particular has scaled back their organic adversary elements in recent years. But faced with emerging threats and the need to train and challenge 5th generation fighter pilots in training, the service has become increasingly in favor of shifting increased aggressor capacity to private contractors, such as Draken.  Using contractors gives the U.S. military more flexibility to schedule exercises around the training and pre-deployment needs of fleet units rather than the availability of aggressors and do so for a lower overall cost. The company provides its own pilots and maintains  for its own aircraft, meaning the U.S. military doesn’t have to pull its own resources away from other priorities or maintain separate, dedicated units.” Various contractors, such as Draken , Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (ATAC), TacAir , and Top Aces , have noticed the trend, too. As noted, Draken has already been securing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of deals to provide this kind of support at Nellis and other locations. At the former site, the company has been working with the Air Force’s highly respected Weapons School and taken part in complex, multi-national capstone Red Flag exercises . At the same time, the industry as a whole has been looking to expand their capacity and capabilities. Most recently, there has been a push to provide aircraft that can adequately represent opponents in fourth-generation fighter jets. Both ATAC and Draken have purchased second-hand French-made Mirage F1s in various configurations specifically for this purpose. A Spanish Air Force Mirage F1M. Draken bought a number of these aircraft from Spain in 2017., Draken International Draken is also acquiring a number of South African Cheetah fighters , a highly modified derivative of the Mirage III . Another firm, TacAir, recently took delivery of a number of ex-Jordanian F-5E Tiger II combat jets, too. A single-seat Atlas Cheetah C fighter jet. Draken purchased a number of these from South Africa in 2017., Draken International The aforementioned commercial adversary support program at Kingsley Field in Oregon is a good poster-child for what contractors can offer. With Kingsley hosting the last F-15C/D schoolhouse in the Air Force, its throughput has suffered in no small part due to an increasing shortage of pilots across the service’s active and reserve components. Draken’s jets and their pilots will free up instructors from having to play the “red air” role and give them more opportunities to fly with new aviators instead. “The base’s mission long-term right now is still to provide the best F-15 pilots to the combat air forces but hopefully the integration will prove that we can produce more pilots and provide higher quality training for our current 15 students,” U.S. Air Force Captain Chris Dubois, a member of the 173rd Fighter Wing, told Oregon’s Herald and News newspaper earlier in June 2018. “Leaning on their [Draken’s] experience and their depth of knowledge will help our students learn as well.” Even more relevant is that the L-159, which packs a modern multi-mode pulse doppler radar, costs a fraction of what an F-15C costs to operate—between $25k and $45k per hour depending on how it’s calculated—in the adversary role. For new pilots, training flights are often just about learning how to execute intercepts and beyond-visual-range engagements where a very high-performance F-15 isn’t needed to act as the bad guy. As such, flying F-15s versus F-15s for new Eagle Driver pilot training, and for many regular fleet training needs as well, is hugely wasteful. It also depletes precious airframe hours on an increasingly geriatric fleet. But while Draken’s current contracts might give them an advantage in securing a number of these future deals, the Air Force definitely looks to be setting itself up to award contracts to multiple vendors. Even spread out among a number of companies, the individual task orders for certain bases are still likely to be multi-million dollar deals and will remain a lucrative opportunity. Some of ATAC’s ex-Israeli Kfir fighter jets, another aircraft that the company pitches as being able to provide a fourth-generation-like surrogate., ATAC The contracting documents also note that the Air Force is in contact with other services, including the U.S. Marine Corps, to potentially make the ADAIR effort a joint arrangement. The Marines have expressed their own interest in contractor-operated combat jets , light attack aircraft , and even gunship helicopters for various training purposes. In addition to working with the Air Force, ATAC has already been providing adversary support to the U.S. Navy for decades, as well. Winning one or more of the U.S. Air Force’s contract could only help boost a private ADAIR company’s profile in general. Draken, ATAC, and others are all eager to expand their business overseas. Draken L-159Es flight with F-16 fighter jets from The Netherlands, left, and Denmark., Draken International The Air Force is clearly interested in having the contracting process as it understands it now wrapped up by the end of 2021, but we don’t know how long it might take to get the full program up and running. What is obvious is that the ADAIR industry is about to get a significant boost and it will be interesting to see how many different companies get an opportunity to take part in this new decade-long program.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 13, 2021",U.S. Amphibious Assault Ship Loaded With F-35s Operating Off Disputed South China Sea Shoal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Filipino fishermen have spotted the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship USS Wasp sailing and conducting flight operations off the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The vessel’s presence there, along with its unusually large complement of stealthy F-35B Joint Strike Fighters , is sure to irk China, which sees the area as a lynchpin in its larger efforts to assert control over the bulk of the region . Fishing boats in the region first noticed the first-in-class Wasp near the shoal, which is at the heart of a long-running territorial dispute between Filipino and Chinese authorities, on Apr. 9, 2019, according to Filipino media outlet ABS-CBN . The amphibious assault ship has been in the South China Sea since March 2019 and arrived in the Philippines on Mar. 30, 2019 , to take part in the annual Exercise Balikatan. This is the first time F-35s of any kind have taken part in these drills. Wasp had already drawn attention after pictures showed it carrying at least 10 F-35Bs, a significantly larger fixed wing force than ships of this class normally deploy with. The U.S. Marine Corps and the Navy have been working for years to examine new concepts of operation for Marine air combat elements, or ACEs, equipped, in part, with Joint Strike Fighters when embarked on amphibious assault ships, which you can read about in more detail here . The force of at least 10 F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron One Two One (VMFA-121) that are onboard Wasp now reflects proposals that could turn amphibious assault ships effectively into light aircraft carriers , if necessary, during major conflicts. “Together they [ Wasp and the F-35Bs] represent an increase in military capability committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the Navy said in an official statement regarding the exercise. “Participating in Balikatan demonstrates their ability to quickly forward deploy in support of an ally should a crisis or natural disaster occur.” Even before arriving near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, the comment about a “free and open” region had already seemed directed at the Chinese, in particular. For years now, China has physically occupied a number of shoals and reefs in the South China Sea and has worked to turn them into man-made military outposts equipped with airfields capable of support heavy combat aircraft and port facilities to enable local naval operations. The Chinese have also deployed shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles and long-range surface-to-air missiles on these artificial islands to challenge the ability of outside actors, including the United States, to operate freely in the region. Full, uncontested control of Scarborough Shoal could give the Chinese a “ strategic triangle ,” with the other major points being Woody Island to the northwest in the Paracel Island chain and a cluster of outposts in the Spratly Islands to the south. Aircraft and ships operating from these islands, along with shore-based defenses, would offer overlapping coverage and present a major threat to any potential opponent trying to move through the region during a crisis. A satellite image of Scarborough Shoal as it existing 2000., NASA A general map of China’s potential “strategic triangle” in the South China Sea, consisting of Woody Island to the northwest, various sites in the Spratly islands to the South, and Scarborough Shoal to the northeast, closer to the Philippines., Google “China’s island-building and military activities in the South China Sea threaten your sovereignty, security, and therefore economic livelihood, as well as that of the United States,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Manila during a visit on Mar. 1, 2019 . “Any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea will trigger mutual defense obligations.” Wasp , with its F-35-heavy aviation component, certainly offers an American challenge to China’s regional claims and a clear demonstration of U.S. commitment to its alliance with the Philippines. If the ship is conducting activities directly related to Exercise Balkistan, it could reflect a more active effort to use those drills to directly assert Filipino claims than in the past, when American and Filipino forces generally stayed clear of the disputed shoal itself. The USS Wasp , with 10 F-35Bs visible on the deck, sails in the South China Sea with the Philippine Navy’s BRP Tarlac landing platform dock, at left, and BRP Ramon Alcaraz , an ex-US Coast Guard Hamilton -class cutter ., USN The area has already been hotly contested between China and the Philippines for years now. In 2012 , Filipino Navy ships moved to arrest Chinese fishermen illegal operating within the Shoal’s lagoon, leading to a protracted standoff with Chinese “ Marine Surveillance ” vessels – now part of China’s Coast Guard – and elements of a paramilitary fishing fleet, which has since become commonly known as the “ Little Blue Men .” The latter is a reference to the “ Little Green Men ,” a mix of Russian special operations forces and local proxies, who appeared in Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 before Russia invaded and illegally annexed the peninsula. The video below shows interactions between Chinese and Filipino ships during the 2012 standoff. The outcome of the standoff was embarrassing to the Philippines, who withdrew, effectively ceding control to the Chinese. Since then, China has continued to assert their authority over the area since and routinely chase Filipino fishermen away . Wasp ‘s appearance in the area is not the first time U.S. forces have made moves to dispute China’s control over Scarborough Shoal. In January 2018 , the Arleigh Burke -class destroyer USS Hopper conducted a so-called Freedom of Navigation Patrol, or FONOP, near the shoal. In April 2016 , U.S. Air Force A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft on a rotational deployment to the Philippines had also flown a mission over the contested area. China responded angrily in both cases, declaring that the United States had violated its sovereignty . Still, how China might react now to Wasp operating in the vicinity of the Shoal isn’t clear. Chinese forces have been increasingly aggressive throughout the South China Sea, even toward American ships , since the beginning of 2018. At the same time, after taking office in 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had also pledged to largely drop the Scarborough Shoal issue, so long as China did not try to further expand its physical presence there, in favor of improving ties with Beijing. However, in recent months, Duterte has faced increasing criticism for his stance toward China and its aggressive actions in the region. Just days ago, the Philippine military said that Chinese Coast Guard vessels and Little Blue Men had “ swarmed ” Pag-asa Island in the Spratly chain, which the Philippines occupies with its own military garrison, prompting an unusually strong response from the Filipino president. A map of Chinese military outposts in the Spratly island chain. Pag-asa is situated just to the northeast of Subi Reef., DOD “I will not plead or beg, but I am just telling you that lay off the Pag-asa because I have soldiers there,” Duterte said on Apr. 4, 2019 . “If you touch it, that’s another story. Then I will tell my soldiers ‘prepare for suicide missions’.” The United States and China are also in the midst of a protracted trade war , rising tensions over Chinese threats toward Taiwan , and other disputes beyond the South China Sea. So, with Chinese ties with the Philippines cooling off, and a chill in relations between Beijing and Washington, it remains to be seen how China will react, directly or indirectly, to Wasp ‘s sudden appearance with its contingent of F-35Bs near the Scarborough Shoal.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 28, 2019",Indian Radar Data That Supposedly Proves They Downed An F-16 Is Far From “Irrefutable”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Indian Air Force claims radar data from an airborne early warning and control aircraft, along with other intelligence, shows that the Pakistani Air Force lost an F-16 Viper fighter jet during an aerial skirmish in February 2019, an already hotly debated event that The War Zone has covered in detail . This follows a highly circulated report based on unnamed sources from Foreign Policy stating that U.S. government officials inventoried Pakistan’s Viper fleet and found that none of them were missing. Indian Air Force (IAF) Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor laid out the new information in a press briefing on Apr. 8, 2019. Competing Indian and Pakistani claims regarding the aerial brawl over the contested Jammu and Kashmir region on Feb. 27, 2019 , which followed Pakistani air strikes on various Indian bases in the area, continue to swirl more than a month after the incident, which reportedly brought the countries worryingly close to an all-out war . A major disputed part of the narrative remains whether or not IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, flying a MiG-21 Bison, shot down a Pakistani Air Force (PAF) F-16, before getting shot down himself. Read our widely-read pointed takedown on all the bad information and naive assumptions swirling around that engagement at this link . “The IAF has irrefutable evidence of not only the fact that F-16 were [sic] used by PAF on 27 Feb 19 but also that an IAF MiG21 Bison shot down a PAF F-16,” the IAF said in a written statement given to journalists during the press briefing. India has previously shown portions of an American-made AIM-120C-5 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) that the U.S. government sold to Pakistan as evidence that the F-16s were involved in some way. Pakistan has denied that its Vipers, which are its only aircraft capable of carrying AMRAAMs, participated in the battle, to begin with, and continues to deny that it lost any of those jets. Kapoor first showed a radar image of the overall situation. An IAF airborne warning and control aircraft, either one of its A-50EIs or an EMB-145 Netra, operating in the area at the time was tracking three distinct groups of Pakistani jets, one to the north consisting of JF-17 Thunders , one in the middle with F-16s, and a third one to the south with F-16s. The IAF claims as many as 11 F-16s in total took part in the Pakistani strikes on targets in areas of Kashmir under Indian control. Additional Indian MiG-21, Su-30MKI, and Mirage 2000 aircraft had also scrambled in the response to the Pakistani intrusion into Indian airspace. India has now officially claimed that Pakistani F-16s fired multiple AMRAAMs during the battle, but that Indian aircraft dodged the bulk of them thanks to unspecified countermeasures and evasive action, but offered no details to support this assertion. The IAF officer then presented additional images he said showed the period shortly after Wing Commander Varthaman had moved to engage a portion of the enemy F-16s in the middle group. There were three Vipers specifically in the Indian pilot’s “engagement zone,” according to the press briefing. The Indian claim is that Varthaman was then able to shoot down one of these F-16s, before his plane succumbed to enemy fire. The Indian Air Force says it has proven this because the airborne early warning and control aircraft on station had identified the F-16s and saw one of the tracks disappear from its screens completely. We have no way of knowing whether the images that Kapoor presented at the press briefing were taken directly from the radar outputs on AWACS, from a ground radar station or other integrated air defense network node, or were created from data from one or more of those sources specifically for the presentation. When Varthaman purportedly shot down the F-16, there were supposedly separate reports from Indian Army outposts along the so-called Line of Control (LOC), which separate the areas of Kashmir under Indian and Pakistan control, that troops had seen multiple parachutes falling on the Pakistani side in different, distinct locations. The MiG-21 is a single-seat aircraft, but it also has a drogue chute, which could have deployed inadvertently before it crashed, leading to the sightings of an additional parachute. An Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison., Jyotirmoy895 via Wikimedia Pakistan’s existing official claims about the shootdowns are already confusing and conflicting . At first, Pakistani authorities said that, in addition to Varthaman, there were as many as two additional Indian pilots on the ground who it was searching for. Subsequent statements from the Pakistani Military’s main public affairs office, known as Inter-Services Public Relations, said that a second, unnamed individual was in custody with no mention of a third pilot. There is no evidence to support any variation of these claims. India now says these reports of additional Indian aviators in Pakistani detention were, in fact, the crew of the Pakistani F-16. The PAF has two-seat F-16Bs, BMs, and Ds, which would account for one plane crashing, but two pilots ejecting. A Pakistani F-16BM dropping GBU-10/B laser-guided bombs during a training exercise, Asuspine via Wikimedia “This is corroborated by radio communications intercepts of Pakistan Army formations in the area,” the IAF’s written statement added. These “categorically state the capture of atleast [sic] two pilots, one of them being Wg Cdr Abhinandan and a second one being admitted to CMH [a Pakistani Combined Military Hospital].” However, the IAF has similarly declined to share the intercepted radio communications themselves or a transcript thereof, making it impossible to independently verify the claims. “Due to security and confidentiality concerns, we are restricting the information being shared in public domain,” IAF Air Vice Marshal Kapoor said during the briefing. India and Pakistan are in agreement now that Abhinandan Varthaman was the only Indian aviator ever in Pakistani custody following the skirmish. There are also confirmed photographs of the crash site of his MiG-21. It is worth noting that Varthaman landed, got attacked by a mob of Pakistani civilians before authorities arrived and detained him. They provided first aid and questioned the Indian pilot before moving him to a military hospital. It is very possible that there was some confusion and that the “second” individual admitted to the CMH was actually the Indian Wing Commander. Part of the wreckage of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 Bison., AP Photo/Abdul Razzaq It’s also worth pointing out that India has not provided any evidence of the F-16 shootdown beyond the radar track “vanishing.” Kapoor only showed two still radar images, as well. Without having more data and context, we have no way of knowing conclusively that the contact disappeared and never reappeared or that it was an F-16, to begin with. Electronic warfare and the limitations of the airborne early warning and control system could have been factors, as well. The mountainous terrain and other ground clutter may have masked the Viper’s radar signatures temporarily and the fighter could have dropped into the “doppler notch” of the airborne radar system. There are so many possible explanations that cannot be ruled out without more information and at the very least, full motion video of the tactical picture, not just a few hand-picked screenshots. There is no indication that Pakistan launched any combat search and rescue effort to recover the crew of the purportedly downed F-16, which one might have expected to see, either. There is an unsubstantiated report that a group of civilians on the ground lynched a Pakistani pilot after his plane got shot down, mistaking him for an Indian aviator, but this is incredibly hard to believe. Pakistan has also released images of portions of Russian-made R-73 Archer and R-77 Adder missiles it recovered from the MiG-21 crash site as evidence that Varthaman never got off a shot. The remains of one of the close-range R-73s, which numerous reports say was the weapon that brought down the F-16 , consists of just elements of the rocket motor and seeker head, raising questions about this claim. The remains of two R-73 and two R-77 missiles from the crash site of Wing Commander Varthaman’s MiG-21 Bison., Pakistan Inter-Services Public Relations “The infrared seeker right in front is completely destroyed when it detonates. No part is left intact,” an unnamed senior IAF official declared to Asia Times . But the R-73’s warhead section is relatively small and is supposed to detonate outward as the missile flies in close proximity to the target, showering it with shrapnel, not exploding straight forward as the weapon physically slams into a plane. With this in mind, an R-73 missile missing its middle section is what one might expect to see if it had passed near its target and functioned as intended. Of course, the extensive damage may also have been a result of missiles hitting Varthaman’s MiG-21 or the fighter jet then crashing into the ground. Not surprisingly, Pakistan has denied India’s latest claims, while also reiterating their own unsubstantiated claim that Pakistani aircraft shot down a second Indian combat jet during the skirmish. There is no photographic or video evidence, even unconfirmed imagery from bystanders, of any other crash sites on either side of the LOC, beyond that of the MiG-21, in the aftermath of the battle. Pakistan does not claim to be responsible for bringing down an Indian Mi-17V5 transport helicopter, a separate incident that India has officially said was an accident, but which some posit may have been the result of friendly fire . The Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing an election at the end of this month , has been under increasing pressure to prove its claims about both the aerial skirmish on Feb. 27, 2019, and unprecedented air strikes near the Pakistani town of Balakot the day before, which precipitated the air battle. There has been mounting evidence that also calls into question India’s claims that its jets successfully destroyed their targets in the Feb. 26, 2019 aerial raid. This latest IAF press briefing also follows the aforementioned report from Foreign Policy on Apr. 4, 2019, citing two unnamed U.S. defense officials, that the United States counted Pakistan’s F-16s and found that none of them were missing. Pakistan’s F-16s, including jets obtained second-hand from Jordan, are under heavy U.S. export controls, which could allow for American inspections of the jets at the U.S. government’s request. One of the Pakistani Air Force’s Block 52 F-16Ds taxies at PAF Base Shahbaz near Jacobabad, Pakistan., USAF There are reports that the export agreement also limited the functionality of key systems and the PAF’s ability to service major components independently. There have also been rumors of tracking devices or additional systems that would allow American authorities to remotely disable the aircraft or certain systems, if necessary. Asia Times subsequently reported that Pakistani officials, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, had also said an American audit had taken place and involved sending all of the Vipers to PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, which is home of the PAF’s Central Air Command. After that report came out, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken to Twitter to slam India’s claims of having shot down an F-16. “BJP’s attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F 16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan’s fleet,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan Tweeted out on Apr. 6, 2019, referring to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) political party. “The truth always prevails and is always the best policy.” But sending all the F-16s to Mushaf would have been a major logistical undertaking. The PAF has around 76 Vipers total, including A/B, AM/BM, and C/D models. Even if they are all technically in service, it is, at best, statistically improbable that all of them are flyable at any one time. Some should have been undergoing major maintenance that would have made it even more difficult to return them to any sort of mission capable state or otherwise move them to the base in Sargodha. In addition, the U.S. government has, so far, declined to officially confirm or deny that the F-16 count occurred or that it directly substantiated Pakistan’s claims. At the time of writing, the Pentagon had not yet responded to queries on the matter from The War Zone . The U.S. Department of Defense was not “aware of any investigation like that,” a spokesperson reportedly told India’s Hindustan Times on Apr. 6, 2019 . “As a matter of policy, the Department does not publicly comment on details of government-to-government agreements on end-use monitoring of U.S.-origin defense articles,” the U.S. State Department public affairs office wrote in a statement to The War Zone by Email. “It is important to note that since January 2018, the United States government has suspended security assistance to Pakistan.” The Hindustan Times also received this same exact same statement from the State Department. A member of the US Air Force, at left, gives senior Pakistani Air Force officers an overview of the Daniels Kit, a tool kit used to repair complex wiring systems on F-16s, during a visit to Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas in 2006., USAF The comment about the suspension of military aid to Pakistan is notable. U.S.-Pakistani relations are at a recent low, with U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration cutting military aid to the country after accusing Pakistan of not doing enough to combat terrorists within its territory who also operate in neighboring Afghanistan. The Trump Administration has also pushed for greater ties with India, which is Pakistan’s chief rival, including military-to-military cooperation. In addition, there has been significant political opposition to selling F-16s to Pakistan at all from members of Congress over the years for various reasons, chiefly allegations that its state security apparatus is at least complicit in various terrorist activities if it is not supporting them outright . With this in mind, there have been suggestions that Pakistan has a sufficiently large number of political enemies in Washington, D.C. at present who would have leaked details about a lost Pakistani F-16 if the U.S. government was aware of it. There is similarly nothing to back up conspiratorial rumors that the U.S. government is looking to conceal a Pakistani F-16 loss, especially to a heavily modernized MiG-21, for fear that it could impact future Viper or other American fighter jet sales abroad. F-16 manufacturer Lockheed Martin is presently trying to sell an advanced F-16 variant to India itself, rebranded the F-21 . Such an outlandish conspiracy is preposterous, to begin with. An artist’s conception of the F-21, an advanced F-16 variant that Lockheed Martin is pitching to the Indian Air Force., Lockheed Martin India’s Prime Minister Modi has used the Varthaman shoot down to publicly argue for speeding up purchases of French-made Rafales, a deal that opposition parties in India have accused of being rife with corruption and graft . Separately, Russia’s state media has used the incident to argue that the IAF should buy more Russian jets . Regardless, the exact details of the aerial engagement that led to the Pakistanis shooting down the MiG-21 remain unclear. The truth is that air combat is a multi-faceted and extremely complex affair where the exact capabilities of two individual planes account for just a fraction of the many factors at play. You can read more about this in The War Zone ’s previous deep analysis of the aerial skirmish on Feb. 27, 2019. Furthermore, it’s unclear why India waited more than a month to release this latest information, which still does not conclusively prove that the IAF shot down an F-16 in any tangible way. On Feb. 28, 2019, just a day after the aerial brawl, Indian authorities publicly showed the AIM-120C-5 fragment, which did offer compelling evidence that Pakistani Vipers had, at least, taken part in the operation overall. India’s latest release of information is interesting, but it remains too circumstantial and limited to put the issue of whether or not the IAF shot down an F-16 to rest for good. The Indian government’s repeated claims, and the counter-claims of an audit of Pakistani Vipers, only seem to raise new questions about exactly what happened in the skies over Kashmir more than a month ago.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 14, 2019",Navy’s Trash Is NASA’s Treasure As Surplus F/A-18Bs Begin Arriving At Armstrong Flight Test Center,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center has taken delivery of the first of three F/A-18B Hornet jets it expects to receive from the U.S. Navy . This will be the largest influx of “new” aircraft the center has seen in nearly a decade and could be a major boon to its research efforts, including studies related to quieter supersonic travel and why U.S. military pilots might suffer from dangerous hypoxia-like symptoms . The two-seat F/A-18B arrived at Armstrong, which is situated within Edwards Air Force Base in California, after flying from Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland on Nov. 13, 2018 . High winds forced the aircraft to make an overnight stop at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. NASA did not say what unit the aircraft had previously belonged to, but Pax River is home to the U.S. Naval Test Pilots School and various research and development squadrons . NASA is set to get another B-model Hornet from Pax River before the end of 2018. A third example will come from Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas in 2019. The last time Armstrong took possession of three aircraft in a similarly short amount of time, was when the center took delivery of three ex-U.S. Air Force F-15D Eagles in 2010. In March 2018, the Navy disclosed that it had approved plans to begin retiring its F/A-18A-D model Hornets , also known collectively as Legacy Hornets. The U.S. Marine Corps will receive a significant number of the F/A-18C/Ds as a result, but the F/A-18A/B types are becoming available for other uses, including by NASA. The Navy does expect to continue flying at least some of the older Hornets operationally itself through 2026 and for non-combat support missions, such as in the role of aggressors , for some time after that, as well. “Although the aircraft Armstrong is receiving are nearing the end of their service life for the Navy, some of the aircraft could have extended use for the center,” Tim Krall, a flight operations engineer at Armstrong said in an official NASA press release . “There are fewer flight hours on research and mission support aircraft than the frequent flight rates required for the military.” The “newish” Hornets could also have much more life left in them for these types of limited research missions as compared to the NASA’s existing three F/A-18s, which include two single-seat A models and a lone B model. Armstrong received these from the Navy between 1984 and 1991, according to an official fact sheet . NASA personnel at the Armstrong Flight Center talk with US Navy Lieutenant Commander Mike Shelton, in the flight suit, after he brought the first of three F/A-18Bs to the facility on Nov. 13, 2018., NASA Since then, NASA has used these jets primarily for research support , which includes flying as chase planes during tests of other aircraft and taking photos and videos during those events. In addition, its F/A-18B is configured to be able to stream full-motion video straight to engineers on the ground to further help monitor the basic safety of any test flight. The two-seat aircraft also has the benefit of a second individual to operate the various mission systems and reduce the workload in the pilot. The Hornets have also taken part in research in their own right. In August 2018 , the F/A-18s, along with Armstrong’s three F-15Ds, began supporting research into persistent reports of hypoxia-like symptoms from U.S. military pilots. This is a serious issue has dogged the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps for years and NASA is helping build a baseline dataset of what physiological effects fighter pilots can expect to endure during various flight maneuvers. This will help military researchers better identify and understand abnormal episodes. NASA’s existing F/A-18B Hornet., NASA The same day the former Navy F/A-18B touched down at Armstrong, NASA’s two-seat Hornet also flew a test flight in the Houston and Galveston, Texas areas during which it employed a “low-boom” or “ quiet thump technique ” to reduce the felt impact of sonic booms on communities down below. This is part of a broader effort to explore supersonic air travel that is nearly “boomless,” which could have a game-changing impact on both commercial and military aviation . The “quiet” supersonic flight program is a lead up to the start of testing of the experimental X-59A Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) test plane. On Nov. 16, 2018, NASA and Lockheed Martin announced the official start of the X-59A’s construction. The aircraft will hopefully make its first flight in 2021. NASA doesn’t appear to have decided whether it will use the jets to replace the planes it already has or add them to its existing fleet. If the organization did decide to expand its capacity, this could allow it perform more research missions in total. With additional aircraft, there would be more alternate jets available in case another one is not available for a scheduled flight due to a maintenance issue or other problem, as well. NASA could also take on more of the Navy’s F/A-18A/Bs as parts sources or for static research purposes. There are a number of non-flyable Hornet airframes at Armstrong already. Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that the F/A-18Bs NASA is getting now will actually find their way into regular service or will be airworthy enough to support its various mission requirements. At present, officials at Armstrong plan to conduct a fly-off of sorts between the first two jets and pick the best performing one to add to the active fleet as soon as possible. After taking delivery of the third aircraft in 2019, NASA then expects to make a separate decision about whether or not to fully accept one or both of the remaining jets into service, as well. One of NASA’s F/A-18A Hornets., NASA Before the evaluations can even begin, the Hornets will each need a months-long phase maintenance period to ensure everything is working properly. They will then need modifications in order to accept the NASA-specific mission equipment found on the aircraft it already has in inventory. The F/A-18Bs will retain their overall gray tactical scheme until NASA formally accepts them into service, after which they would get the trademark white-with-blue cheat line paint job. Each one will receive a civil registration code, or N-number, and sport the NASA logo on their tails, though. Since arriving at Armstrong, the first Hornet from Pax River has gotten the N-number N868NA. Armstrong hasn’t given a firm timeline for when it might make a final decision on how many ex-Navy F/A-18Bs it will add to its fleet in the near term. But given the demands of its research programs and the aging state of its present fleet, it seems very likely that we’ll see at least one new Hornet in NASA colors sooner rather than later.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 9, 2018",Those Lights In The Sky Seen Across The U.S. Were Big Formations Of Military Airlifters,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. From South Carolina to Missouri to Denver to Utah and beyond, reports popped up last night from people seeing large formations of lights in the sky heading westward. Considering it’s about two weeks too soon for Santa to be on the job, and taking out a Red Dawn scenario or an alien invasion, people were puzzled as to what they were actually witnessing. Well there’s no reason to worry as we can confidently report that the objects in question were dozens of USAF transport aircraft heading towards Nellis AFB, the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), and other locations out west, likely as part of a well established large-scale air power exercise that focuses on America’s unique airlift abilities. The sightings began on early Saturday evening around on the east coast and slowly moved west as time went on. Tweets began springing up from all over with concerned citizens not knowing exactly what they were seeing. Local news stations jumped on the story , and began asking the same questions as those who were spotting the strange aerial phenomenon. Our good Twitter friends @Aircraftspots, who always have a keen eye on aircraft movements around the U.S. and beyond, were following the action closely. By around midnight they were tracking no less than 30 C-17s and 20 C-130s making their way across the country towards Nevada. Such a mass migration of cargo aircraft towards NTTR is indicative of one major training event in particular—Joint Forceable Entry Exercise (JFEX). JFEX occurs around this time of year—and in June—as a capstone event for USAF Weapons School classes. Think of these courses as Topgun but for all types of USAF communities and longer, not to mention even more academic. In the case of JFEX, primarily cargo haulers and heavy transports take the center stage over fighters or bombers. Students plan and lead these exercises as part of the school’s “graduate level” curriculum which is notoriously demanding. The hope if that at the end of all of it each student will graduate with the lauded title of Weapons Instructor for their specific platform, also known as the “Target Arm” in many units. Being able to proudly wear the coveted Weapons Instructor patch is also a huge added bonus. https://youtube.com/watch?v=MNGQymfBhiU JFEX in particular has progressively become more relevant with every iteration. The idea behind it is to train as a large force, while incorporating elements from across the Defense Department’s combat domains, to break through an enemy’s anti-access bubble and setup a foothold in their own backyard. Hence the name “Forceable Entry.” This is done principally by using America’s unique airlift capacity. Often times forward operating bases are setup on the Nellis Range Complex and at a number of locales around the country, where C-17s and C-130s will be guided in by USAF Combat Controllers, just as if they would in a real scenario. Other transports will make airdrops of all sorts, including executing large-scale airborne assaults. For units heading to NTTR as part of the exercise, fighters and attack aircraft will provide cover and suppression of enemy air defenses for them, and other aircraft will provide surveillance, command and control, and electronic warfare support. Ground combat units are a key component of JFEX as well. It is the quality of this entire ultra-complex “package,” and its implementation for a common set of scenario-based objectives that the Weapons School students will be judged on. USAF I wrote a previous piece detailing JFEX in 2014 which you should take a look at, and in it I quoted Capt. Cliff Caldwell, 62nd Operations Support Squadron wing weapons and tactics director, stating: “This is day one and night one of the war… This is us going in and taking all the training that we do and putting it all together and focus on application of combat skills.” What makes this particular iteration of the exercise, or another drill very similar to it, somewhat different is that this high-profile nation-spanning portion of it is occurring at night. This makes total sense though as this is likely when such a large-scale mission would occur during wartime, and there are some very important benefits and challenges posed by executing such an operation under the cover of darkness. A side effect of this is that people all over the U.S. were seeing strings of lights in the sky heading west without any explanation. USAF In retrospect, what’s actually pretty cool is that these folks were lucky enough to see what America’s air force is capable of in a time of war. The USAF’s ability to rapidly project immense power into remote places is a very strong deterrent in itself, and a very important capability to have available should the need arise. During a major peer-state conflict, especially one against say China, where the vastness of the Pacific region can either work against or for you, these types of tactics will be critical to success. With the USAF’s transport aircrews ready to inject major military power virtually anywhere with a dirt strip long enough to accommodate a C-130 and/or C-17, it opens up a whole new set of options for commanders and keeps the enemy from being able to neuter America’s regional combat capability just by barraging master air bases with ballistic missiles and other long-range weaponry. We have contacted the USAF for comment and are awaiting a reply. We will update this post with more information as we receive it. In the meantime keep looking up!

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 5, 2017",Marine F-5 Aggressors Becoming Far More Threatening Via “Red Net” Data Link Upgrade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USMC’s small fleet of a dozen F-5N/F aggressor aircraft flown by VMFT-401 “Snipers” out of MCAS Yuma are receiving a major upgrade in capability. A so-called “Red Net” tactical and situational awareness data link system is being installed on the jets. The system uses a commercially available tablet-kneeboard display, which is significantly more flexible and cost-effective than integrating a data-link display into the F-5N/F’s cockpit avionics, which are largely made up of “steam” gauges along with a recently upgraded radar and navigational display. The upgrade was discussed in the recently released Marine Corps 2019 Aviation Plan . It states: “A recent upgrade to the F-5 is a red-net data link solution that provides requisite safety and tactical awareness through securing a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) kneeboard tablet that has been funded and is fielding. Upgrading EA [electronic attack] capabilities in the future is also a priority within the adversary community and Program Office.” F-5N landing at MCAS Yuma. , USMC The F-5 Tiger II has been flying for the Navy in the adversary support role for 45 years . Read what it is like to fly the aircraft in this role in this past special feature of ours. We don’t know the capabilities of this exact data link system, but it should drastically increase the F-5 adversary’s capabilities. Not only would it allow a ‘God’s eye’ view of the where the other adversary aircraft are in the battlespace and what their onboard sensors are seeing, but it could have additional capabilities. These could very likely include “synthetic radar,” where software and offboard telemetry gives pilots a radar-like picture of where their opponents are within certain parameters that simulate the limitations of enemy sensor systems. Linking the “picture” from non-fighter assets, such as ground, sea, and air-based radar systems are also features that a data link like this should be able to provide. All the information from the data link is displayed on the tablet kneeboard, which can offer superior fidelity and adaptability over small console-mounted displays. The kneeboard tablet operating as a heads-down situational display could be able to also display radar warning receiver (RWR) and electronic warfare information, as well. It could even be able to potentially display electro-optical/infrared imagery if those sensors were bolted on to the aircraft. It’s worth noting that at least some U.S. F-5 pilots are already flying with Apple iPad mini kneeboards. Tablet kneeboard displays have become a proven and very cost-effective solution for upgrading older tactical aircraft with new sensor and situational awareness capabilities. For the last years of its life, the Super Étendard Modernisé used a tablet kneeboard so that its pilots could interface with its advanced targeting pod and more (seen above). , Youtube Screencap All this is software and hardware dependent, but this economical arrangement would offer the Marines a lot of flexibility when it comes to integrating new threat replication sensors in the future. Above all else, it could allow the F-5s to link with higher-end contractor operated adversary support aircraft in the future, many of which will be packing far more capable sensors than what the Marine F-5s carry today. Just one aircraft equipped with an advanced radar in a formation could share all that info with the rest of the red air jets, acting as a huge force multiplier at a bargain price. The same can be said for information gained from infrared search and track systems or advanced radar warning and homing systems. So, you can see why such a system is so valuable and such a value. America’s potential enemies are fully aware of this and fly with their own data link system of varying degrees of quality and capability. Having a specialized data link system for aggressor aircraft could even allow the data link itself to perform differently based on the threat profile being presented to fleet aircrews. This could be achieved via software filters, not expensive hardware changes. The Marines’ 12 F-5N/Fs serve alongside the Navy’s F-5N/F fleet, which includes 31 jets across two squadrons—VFC-13 at NAS Fallon, Nevada and VFC-111 at NAS Key West, Florida—so it is probably very safe to assume that this upgrade is also happening across the Navy’s Tiger II fleet. Tyler Rogoway/Author NAVAIR, which manages both the Navy and Marine Corps aircraft inventory, has requested funds to dramatically augment their F-5 fleet by purchasing 22 second-hand F-5E/Fs from Switzerland—the same place where the current fleet of F-5N/Fs came from over a decade ago. You can read all about this planned acquisition in this recent piece of ours. The need for more F-5s to augment the current fleet is also reflected in the Marine’s 2019 Aviation Plan: “The F-5 fleet is funded for life-limited components such as upper cockpit longerons, wings, horizontal stabilator pairs, and vertical stabilators that will enable the F-5 to achieve its planned 6000 (F-5F)/9000 (F-5N) hour life. This extends the Department of the Navy’s 43. … The Marine Corps [current] F-5 fleet has a service life plan that begins divestiture of current platforms in 2026. … Procurement of additional F-5s with significant service life remaining would provide additional organic adversary resources and expand capacity. Headquarters Marine Corps Aviation continues to assess global fighter procurement opportunities…” “Sniper” F-5N., USMC Suffice to say that the USMC and the Navy need more organic adversary capacity to support their growing F-35 and advanced 4th generation fighter fleets. These aircraft, with their AESA radars and enhanced sensor fusion, have a huge appetite for adversary aircraft. The smaller volumes of aggressors used in the past simply don’t challenge their aircrews. USMC’s 2019 Aviation Plan makes a huge point of the rapidly increasing deficit of organic adversary support capacity: Adversary capacity is the greatest issue in Marine Corps air-to-air training, followed closely by range availability and modernization, and training simulator capabilities. VMFT-401 can source up to 3300 sorties per year, restrained by aircraft utilization and numbers of F-5s assigned. Combining A/A requirements for fleet training, FRS [Fleet Replenishment Squadron] production and weapon school support, the USMC builds an adversary requirement of over 10,000 sorties in 2019. Accordingly, the USMC suffers a nearly 7000-sortie capacity gap. … Marine aviation is working with the Navy to determine future Department of the Navy adversary requirements and to conduct analysis on future government and vendor operated solutions. The DoN adversary solution will require a solution for the increase in adversary demand and investment in upgraded capability to represent modern and future adversary threats. Current USMC adversary inventory is 12 F-5s assigned to VMFT-401 at MCAS Yuma that execute local training and detachments to away sites for training support. Marine aviation is researching the requisite manning and logistics to expand adversary capacity and capability while improving accessibility by possibly placing resources at MCAS Beaufort in support of the F35 FRS. Expanding adversary capacity could be accomplished with either government operated aircraft, vendor-operated aircraft, or a combination of both. The current configuration and future upgrades to the F-5 do not meet all of these MAGTF [Marine Air-Ground Task Force] requirements for adversary against F-35 and FA-18, but these aircraft can effectively service many fixed-wing, rotary-wing DACM, GBAD, and C2 training needs. A combination of fleet support and investment in contracted 4th generation fighters will augment the USMC F-5 fleet in supporting high-end adversary training requirements. An F-5N pilot inspects a jet before heading out on an adversary mission. , USMC As we were first to report , the USMC has been eyeing setting up another F-5 adversary support squadron or detachment at MCAS Beaufort since 2017. Supporting F-35 pilot production is the main catalyst for this, with helping with fleet readiness training and advanced fighter syllabi coming in close behind. Even half a dozen additional F-5 airframes could potentially make this a reality. Beyond that, the Marines look ready to deeply embrace contactor adversary support on a grand scale. What this means is that that the USMC’s F-5s will be flying with contractor operated and upgraded fighters like F-1 Mirages , Atlus Cheetahs , and yes, more F-5s , as well as other high-performance airframes, in the years to come. In fact, the Navy picked a contractor with deeply upgraded F-5s over one with F-16s for their adversary support contract at Naval Air Station Fallon recently. You can read all about why they chose the F-5 offering in this past feature of ours. With that in mind, you can see how binding all these assets together via a proprietary “red net” data link would be absolutely essential for getting as much value out of each training flight hour as possible. And remember, this training isn’t just about dogfighting. It’s about high-speed target saturation, beyond-visual-range threat tactics representation, and learning to fight and win in an electronic warfare environment. Amazingly, the F-5 remains just about the most economical platform available that can pull off such a mission set—albeit with the help of modern upgrades like “red net” data links.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 3, 2024","U.S. Navy hovercraft evacuated Americans from Tripoli, Libya (Updated)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Factions of the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by hardline General Khalifa Haftar , have made a thrust into Tripoli and have claimed to have taken control of Tripoli International Airport, which hasn’t been anywhere near fully functional since 2014. The UN-backed Libyan government calls Tripoli home, whereas Haftar has amassed his power largely in the eastern and southern stretches of Libya. Last week, Haftar—who enjoys varying degrees support from the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , and Russia —ordered his militias to take the Libyan Government’s seat of power in what could be a far more decisive military operation than most expected it to be. On Saturday, April 6th, 2019 the UN Security Council demanded Haftar stop his military push into Tripoli and to de-escalate the growing military crisis that could see various militia factions pour into Tripoli for what would be another bloody battle for the war-torn city. Video has now emerged showing U.S. Navy Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft approaching and landing on the beach in the town of Janzour, which is located just a few miles to the west of Tripoli. The LCACs supposedly landed, loaded-up, and left the area. U.S. Marines also likely supported the operation by providing additional security. An official statement from U.S. Africa Command says that personnel were “relocated” as a result of the deteriorating security situation. U.S. Africa Command LCACs are heavy-load carrying ship-to-shore conveyors capable of accessing unimproved beaches and loading and offloading as much as 75 tons or hundreds of personnel. As such, they are an ideal solution for rapidly evacuating people and material from coastal areas. Using LCACs instead of helicopters also allows for the elimination of the risk posed by shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles taking down a helicopter—and there are many of those weapons floating around Libya. Considering potentially hostile forces had not reached the coast in that area yet, the threat to the lumbering LCACs was likely low. It isn’t clear what amphibious ship was launching and recovering the LCACs. The Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group was operating in the Arabian Sea as of April 1st and there is no indication that it has pushed through the Suez Canal since. A single San Antonio class amphibious transport dock or a Whidbey Island or Harpers Ferry class landing ship dock could be working as the mothership for the LCACs. Using a local land base is more doubtful as Malta would be the closest possibility, but it would stretch the LCACs range unless auxiliary fuel was carried. LCAC approaching the well deck of an amphibious assault ship., USN The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated nearly five years ago via a tense convoy to the Tunisian border backed up by Marine airpower. Still, American forces and diplomatic staff have continued to work in Libya with a special focus on helping the Libyan Government maintain its rickety grip on portions of the country. It was hoped that a conference on holding national elections would be held soon, but that may be in question now as hostile forces sit in a position to potentially expel the Government Of National Accord from their own capital. Sky News reports that Ghassan Salame, UN special envoy to Libya, stated the following after Haftar had sent his forces pushing toward Tripoli International Airport: “We have worked for one year for this national conference, we won’t give up this political work quickly.” Attempts to de-escalate the situation on an official level through negotiations have been rebuffed by Haftar, with the BBC stating: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in the city [Tripoli] to discuss the ongoing crisis. Gen Haftar spoke to Mr. Guterres in Benghazi on Friday, and reportedly told him that his operation would not stop until his troops had defeated “terrorism.” Prime Minister al-Serraj said his government had “extended our hands towards peace” while Gen Haftar had declared a coup. Meanwhile, Haftar has declared a no-fly-zone over the western half of Libya while government air power has been striking Haftar’s forces, albeit those sorties seem to have done little to slow his forces’ advance into Tripoli. https://youtube.com/watch?v=HvW0SFKd2tQ If Haftar’s operation to take control of Tripoli proceeds, it could lead the country into a deeper fight as western militias work to expel him from the captial or even struggle to hold on to the territory they hold to the west of it. There is also a chance that certain members of the international community could step in militarily with airpower in an attempt to repulse Haftar’s assault, but that could spark a major international crisis considering the various parties involved and their conflicting interests. Regardless, today’s imagery and news just further underscores how chaotic and unsettled Libya remains over eight years after Operation Odyssey Dawn kicked off. UPDATE: 6:55am PDT— A couple of notes worth mentioning: The Libyan Government is now saying that they are going to execute a counter-offensive against Haftar’s forces in Tripoli. Amphibious Ready Groups to split up often. It is very possible that USS Arlington (LPD 24) and/or USS Fort McHenry (LSD 43) are present in the Mediterranean while the USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) is operating in the Arabian Gulf. In fact, the Arlington was last spotted two weeks ago off Carthage: MV-22 Osprey’s brought a high-ranking delegation to Tripoli to meet with the Government of National Accord on March 20th, 2019. This was a very rare event that certainly got the attention of General Haftar. UPDATE: 5:30pm PDT— Haftar’s forces have made the following statement about the no-fly-zone: “We are implementing a #NoFlyZone over west #Libya , any military jet will be considered a target as well as its takeoff location. This includes Aerial photography and excludes commercial flights.” Meanwhile, LNA fighter aircraft based in the eastern part of the country executed airstrikes near Tripoli in support Haftar’s ground forces’ push into the center of the metropolis. There are reports that the Libyan National Army is moving road-mobile SAM systems into position near Tripoli to enforce its no-fly-zone and to keep international aircraft out of the area. The U.S. and its allies often fly reconnaissance missions over the area with turbprop manned aircraft and drones. The UN has repeatedly tried to broker a ceasefire, even just a temporary one to get civilians out of Tripoli, but Haftar isn’t interested. Even mentioning the strongman directly in a joint statement by the UN Security Council was shot down by Russia . We will update this post with new details as more information comes available.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Princess Juliana International airport on St. Martin is among the most famous in the world. It is a Mecca for aviation nerds who can wade into the waters off Maho Beach as wide-body airlines scream just feet overhead on final to the airport’s single runway. Some of the best aviation images are taken here and if you are really brave—or stupid depending on how you look at it—you can try to hang onto the airport’s perimeter fence while being blasted by jet engines spooling-up for takeoff. But bad weather usually doesn’t come to mind when you think of the Carribean island paradise, yet it certainly does occur. The 757 in the clip below encountered just that while attempting to land there. As you can see in the video below, the jet approaches the runway under poor visibility and heavy rain and begins a nasty wing drop and begins to sink just as it passes high over the fenceline. It then powers up and goes around, seemingly at the last possible moment. Here is a direct link to the twitter clip if it doesn’t propagate automatically below: Here’s are some clips of what normal 757 operations at the airport should look like: Princess Juliana International is already tricky to operate out of with its tight confines and the close proximity of the runway’s edge to a major roadway and beach area, but bad weather certainly makes it all that much more challenging.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 3, 2020",Here’s What’s In The Army’s Requirements For A Future High-Speed Assault Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has revealed new details about what it wants from its high-speed, long-range replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk series of helicopters. The service’s goal is to have the first examples of this future assault rotorcraft in service by 2030, with additional variants for U.S. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Marine Corps following soon thereafter. The Army’s Program Executive Office for Aviation issued a request for information regarding what the service formally calls the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft ( FLRAA ) on Apr. 4, 2019. FLRAA is part of the over-arching Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, through which the service hopes to replace all of its existing helicopters. If the Army keeps to its proposed schedule, it will award a contract for the rotorcraft – which could be an advanced compound helicopter or a tilt-rotor design – in late 2021. The plan is then to have the selected aircraft make its first flight in 2024 and have the first fully-equipped unit operational with the type six years after that. There is no estimated total purchase order at present, but the service does have more than 2,000 UH-60s of all types across active duty units, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. Sikorsky and Boeing’s SB>1 Defiant, an advanced compound helicopter that could meet the Army’s FLRAA requirements., Sikorsky The Army wants the FLRAA to have a top speed of 250 knots, or more than 285 miles per hour, and potentially up to 280 knots, or more than 320 miles per hour. The maximum speed of the Army’s latest iteration of the Black Hawk, the UH-60M, is still under 200 miles per hour. The FLRAA should also have an unrefueled combat radius of 200 nautical miles and possibly over 300 nautical miles. The threshold requirement for rotorcraft’s maximum range, which it could use to self-deploy to forward locations, would be at least 1,725 nautical miles, while the objective goal is 2,440 nautical miles. Bell’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor, another FLRAA contender., Bell The final design needs to be able to accommodate 12 passengers in crash-resistant seats, up to 4,000 pounds or cargo, or some combination of both. It will also have an external cargo hook able to lug around at least 10,000 pounds and hopefully up to 13,100 pounds. The Army needs the FLRAA to be able to operate in so-called “ hot-and-high ” environments. The rotorcraft has to retain at least 95 percent of normal power to the rotors even at altitudes up to 6,000 feet and in temperatures of up to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while carrying 12 passengers and enough fuel for a combat radius of 120 nautical miles, and perform a 500 feet-per-minute climb out of the landing zone. If possible, the service wants the design to lose no power at all under these conditions. You can see the Army’s full threshold and objective requirements below: US Army The Army plans for the FLRAAs to have an approximately 50-year long service life with the help of future upgrades to “increase capability and maintain relevancy,” according to the request for information. The service has also a target average unit price for the FLRAA design at $43 million in 2018 dollars. This is substantially higher than what the service is paying now for UH-60M Black Hawks. The flyaway cost for an M model in its latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year is around $15.5 million. It is significantly cheaper than the flyaway cost for new V-22 Osprey, though. In its Fiscal Year 2019, budget proposal, the Marines say its new MV-22s have a flyaway cost of $76 million. U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which would be primarily looking to replace the MH-60s within the Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, has only a few publicly stated additional requirements. These are the need for a kit to make the aircraft capable of mid-air refueling and a specific demand that the rotorcraft remains capable of fitting into a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft just like the current Black Hawks. The Marine Corps, which the request for information says could begin buying their own service-specific FLRAA variant two years after the Army awards the initial contract, have much more extensive demands. These are driven largely by the Marines’ need for the rotorcraft to be able to operate from ships in maritime environments, but this service also envisions using them for close air support, deep air support, which the Marines define as any air strikes against targets that do not involve close cooperation with friendly forces on the ground, as well as other armed operations. The stated requirement for up to 350 aircraft in total would allow the Corps to replace all of its AH-1Z Viper gunships and UH-1Y Venom armed utility helicopters, as well as some of its MV-22 Ospreys , if required. However, the Marines specifically say they do expect their FLRAA variants to also serve as Osprey escorts, something the service has also proposed as a mission for armed drones in the future. Notional close air support (CAS) or deep air support (DAS) mission profile for the Marine’s FLRAA., US Army A notional MV-22 escort mission profile for the Marine’s FLRAA., US Army With all this in mind, the Marines are looking for a design with a combat radius of at least 365 nautical miles and potentially more than 450 nautical miles, much greater than the Army’s requirements. To be able to cover those distances rapidly, the Corps is looking for something with a cruising speed of 275 knots, or more than 310 miles per hour, and a top speed of 305 knots, or over 350 miles per hour. This equivalent to the performance of the service’s existing MV-22 Ospreys. If possible, they’re hoping to adopt a rotorcraft that can hit 295 knots while cruising, or almost 340 miles per hour, and have a dash speed of 330 knots, or nearly 380 miles per hour. At present, the world speed record for a non-jet-augmented compound helicopter is less than 300 miles per hour. Jet-augmented helicopters , as well as tilt-rotors , have been able to get close to the threshold speeds the Marines are looking for, but could still have trouble meeting their objective requirements. The Marine Corps is only asking for space for eight troops in its FLRAAs, but also requires that they have a slightly greater overall internal payload capacity compared to the Army’s versions. As with SOCOM, Marine FLRAAs will need to be capable of mid-air refueling, too. The Marines are also eying dedicated attack and utility variants, further pointing to a potential plan to replace its existing AH-1Z and UH-1Ys. Interestingly, the service wants both types to be able to deploy their own small drones to help support their operations. You can see the full Marine-specific requirements below: US Army There is no mention specifically of a requirement for the FLRAA from any other service. The U.S. Air Force and Navy have expressed interest in various portions of the larger FVL program in the past. In addition, within the Army’s Program Executive Office for Aviation, it was the Multi-National Aviation Special Project Office ( MAPSO ) that put out the request for information. MAPSO’s main focus has been on so-called “non-standard” aviation programs aimed mainly at foreign countries, including purchases of Mi-17 Hips and MD 530 Little Birds . This could indicate existing interest for foreign allies and partners who also operate Black Hawk fleets. The FLRAA could also be an attractive choice in small numbers to foreign operators who are looking for Osprey-like capability for more specialized missions, such as special operations or search and rescue roles, at a lower cost. An artist’s conception of a navalized V-280 Valor tilt-rotor that could potentially be a replacement for the Navy’s SH-60 and MH-60 Sea Hawks ., Bell Right now, the leading contenders for the FLRAA program are Bell’s V-280 Valor tilt-rotor and the SB>1 Defiant, from a team-up between Sikorsky and Boeing, which you can read about in more depth here and here , respectively. These two designs are set to face off against each other first as part of the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program, which the Army is leading and has said will help inform the final FVL program requirements. Smaller aviation firms AVX and Karem Aircraft have indicated that could be interested in competing, as well. Airbus Helicopters has announced plans to take part in the Army’s separate Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program, which you can read about in more detail here , but has not mentioned plans to participate in the FLRAA competition. A model of one of Karem Aircraft’s tilt-rotor designs on display during the Association of the US Army’s main annual convention and trade show in Washington, DC, in 2018., Joseph Trevithick It is worth noting that the acquisition timeline the Army has laid out now also shows that the Black Hawk will remain in service for many years to come, long after the first FLRAAs begin arriving. Depending on the complexity and operating costs associated with the final FLRAA design, the Army might end up deciding to keep the traditional helicopters in certain roles, as well. The Army isn’t planning to issue a contract to buy these new rotorcraft until 2021, but it does want responses to its request for information by this time next week. So we may not have to wait too long to begin getting more information on the possible contenders for the service’s future Black Hawk replacement, which might also supplant a number of other helicopters in service across the U.S. military and with American allies and partners abroad.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scaled Composites Model 401, an exotic, stealthy jet aircraft with a dorsal air inlet, trapezoidal “Lambda” wings, chined edges, and a big V-tail has flown from the company’s base in Mojave, California across the country to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. “NAS Pax River,” as it is often called, is the Navy’s premier aerospace test base, roughly akin to Air Force’s Edwards AFB in California. The long trip comes 18 months after the type’s first flight and could help to finally shed some light as to what the aircraft’s mission is and who its intended owner is. It also serves as proof that the design has matured to the point where cross-country flights are not an issue. One of two Model 401s in existence stopping off for gas in Bowling Green, Kentucky on its way to NAS Pax River. What a crazy plane to have show up at your FBO!: Our good friend @CivMilAir helped us track the jet after it left Bowling Green and headed further east, terminating its flight at NAS Patuxent Maryland. @Civmilair Since its first flight , nearly no new details have been officially released about the Model 401’s mission or its intended customer, aside from the fact that it and its sister ship were indeed built for an external entity. The famed aerospace design firm’s original statement read : “Scaled Composites is proud to announce the rollout and first flight of its most recent project, experimental aircraft Model 401. Scaled worked with a proprietary customer to build two vehicles to demonstrate advanced, low-cost manufacturing techniques and to provide aircraft for research flight services to industry partners and the United States government. The two vehicles were designed to be identical in outer mold line and performance, with each aircraft powered by a single Pratt & Whitney JTD-15D-5D engine with 3,045 pounds of thrust. The vehicles are capable of flying Mach 0.6 with a service ceiling of 30,000 feet and have a wingspan of 38 feet and are 38 feet long. They have an empty weight of 4,000 pounds and a maximum take-off weight of 8,000 pounds with an endurance of up to three hours. Aaron Cassebeer, Project Engineer said, “This is such an exciting time for us. Scaled is at the forefront of experimental aircraft development and I am fortunate enough to have a front row seat.” He went on to say this about the mission, “Today was a great day for our test team. We had a great flight and we are looking forward to the future test program.” This successful first flight is the beginning of the flight test phase for vehicle number 1. The Scaled team plans to continue envelope expansion on the first aircraft as they move toward first flight of the second Model 401 vehicle.” Still, Scaled Composites’ corporate silence doesn’t mean that new facts haven’t emerged. We have kept a very close eye on the aircraft and have discovered a bunch of information about its lineage that seems to point towards unique possibilities as to its intended purpose. Above all else, we discovered it is called “Son Of Ares,” with each aircraft being named after the Greek gods of fear and terror Phobos and Deimos. Ares was Scaled Composites’ light close air support prototype from 30 years ago that ended up being turned into a small but highly adaptive testbed for sensor, communications, and avionics technologies, many of which had to do with unmanned aircraft. You can read all about this in these two prior exclusives of ours . Exclusive photos The War Zone obtained also show large cavernous equipment bays located on the bottom of the aircraft’s fuselage. This would point to the possibility that this aircraft could be reconfigured to carry various types of sensor payloads—a feature that is not uncommon on Scaled Composites aircraft. Its upward canted wings may also be indicative of a platform optimized for carrying sensors as it would help keep its target within a sensor’s field of view during banking turns. Model 401 getting some TLC on the ramp in Mojave. Note the bays are open on the underside of the fueselage. , Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films It appears to be a somewhat stealthy design, which would indicate that it has some level of enhanced survivability when operating over or near contested territory, or at the very least, wherever it is intended to be operated could be sensitive in nature. As we noted when it was initially unveiled, its design is remarkably similar to General Atomics’ Predator C/Avenger unmanned aircraft, a plane that also designed with some level of low-observability in mind. It also shares similar attributes with past technology demonstrators, such as Tacit Blue and Bird Of Prey . So, the big question is why would this aircraft fly across the entire country to NAS Pax River? Did the Navy order these aircraft? If so, for what purpose? Are they to become test aircraft that act as surrogates for new sensors? Are they to be used as training aids to replicate the capabilities of penetrating unmanned surveillance aircraft like the RQ-170 Sentinel or Q-11 Avenger during exercises? We know that manned platforms with similar performance as advanced unmanned aircraft currently in service have acted as stand-in surrogates for training exercises . We have also speculated that the aircraft could be optionally manned, similar to the company’s innovative Firebird design . Scaled Composites. With this in mind, maybe U.S. Navy Special Warfare Command has decided to procure a manned aircraft that can easily stand-in for unmanned aircraft during testing and training missions. Clearly, overwatch and airborne intelligence collection has become a very important part of special operations. Most famously, the RQ-170 kept watch on Bin Laden’s compound and was overhead relaying video during Operation Neptune Spear—the SEAL Team Six raid to capture or kill the terrorist mastermind. It’s also possible that it is just visiting the base for some unknown reason. But that’s a long and expensive flight for such an aircraft to make just for show and tell. We have reached out to NAS Patuxent River for more information, we will let you know what we hear back.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 20, 2020",India’s First-Ever Supercarrier Might Be Based On The UK’s Queen Elizabeth Class,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. BAE Systems says it has proposed a design based on the U.K. Royal Navy’s Queen Elizabeth -class to India to meet that country’s requirements for a second domestically-produced aircraft carrier. The Indian government is hoping that, whatever the final design, construction of the future INS Vishal , the country’s first supercarrier, will begin in 2022. On Apr. 4, 2019, Australian Defence Magazine was first to report the developments after speaking with a representative from the U.K.-headquartered defense contractor at 2019 Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) trade show in Malaysia. This event ended on Mar. 30, 2019. India has been laying the groundwork for Vishal since at least 2011 . The country’s authorities sent formal letters of interest about possible carrier designs to BAE, as well as France’s DCNS, U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, and Russia’s central arms exporter Rosoboronexport, in 2015 . “BAE Systems is pleased to have begun discussions with India about the potential for basing development of the second Indigenous Aircraft Carrier [IAC-2] project on the Queen Elizabeth class design,” BAE’s representative in Malaysia said, according to Australian Defence . “The U.K. carrier design has now been proven at sea and is a near match to the Indian Navy’s requirement for a 65,000-ton carrier with Integrated Full Electric Propulsion [IFEP], that could be constructed under the country’s ‘Make in India’ program.” At present, India has one aircraft carrier in service, the INS Vikramaditya , which displaces around 45,000 tons. This is a modified Soviet-era Kiev -class ship, previously known as the Admiral Gorshkov , which the Indians purchased from Russia in 2004. INS Vikramaditya. , Indian Navy That same year, the Indian Navy ordered the country’s first indigenously produced aircraft carrier, also known as IAC-1, the future INS Vikrant . The design is similar in many respects to Vikramaditya and has a displacement of around 40,000 tons. At present, she is expected to enter service in 2021. With her displacement of around 65,000 tons, the future Vishal will be significantly larger than either of these two ships. The Indians had initially considered making her nuclear-powered, as well as, before dropping those plans in favor of a conventional IFEP propulsion system. Beyond these features, the Indians have not publicly released many details about Vishal ’s expected configuration. Most notably, there remains a question about whether it will be a Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery ( CATOBAR ) type, like U.S. Navy supercarriers, or a Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery ( STOBAR ) design with a ski jump in the front like the smaller Vikramaditya and up-coming Vikrant . The future INS Vikrant in 2015., Indian Navy The Indian Navy is certainly interested in acquiring a CATOBAR type aircraft carrier in the future, in general. In the mid-2010s , the service reportedly evaluated General Atomics’ advanced Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for the U.S. Navy’s Ford -class aircraft carriers. In 2017, there were reports that President Donald Trump’s Administration had approved the prospective sale of the EMALS to India. In principle , EMALS offers substantial benefits over traditional steam-powered catapults, including the ability to fine-tune the exact amount of force the system exerts on the launched aircraft. This limits the wear and tear on the airframes, which in turn reduces maintenance and logistical requirements. The U.S. Navy also says it will help increase the Fords ’ ability to generate sorties and launch a wider-range of aircraft, including lighter unmanned systems. In practice, so far, EMALS has seriously underperformed by every meaningful measure, forcing the Navy to reset its baseline requirements for the system. The electronically-controlled Advanced Arresting Gear , another General Atomics product, has also been plagued by developmental issues. The final decision could end up being tied to what the composition of India’s future carrier air wings and what type of carrier-based fighter jets it plans to buy as part of a new tender. The Indian Navy has already soundly rejected a navalized variant of the domestically produced Tejas as overweight and is now looking to foreign designs. Russia is in the running with its MiG-29K, but India has been disappointed with the performance of its existing naval MiG-29s . The other entrants include the Dassault Rafale , a naval variant of the Saab Gripen , and Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet . Boeing has pointedly said that Super Hornet will be able to fly from a catapult or ski-jump-equipped carrier . But whether India decides to go with a CATOBAR arrangement using EMALS or steam, or stick with a STOBAR configuration, BAE will have to make significant changes to the existing Queen Elizabeth design. The Royal Navy’s carriers are built to accommodate Short-Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) type aircraft that don’t need catapults or arresting gear at all. However, the United Kingdom only arrived at this decision after a notable debate over the carrier’s configuration, which means that BAE has already done at least some design work on STOBAR and CATOBAR variations. “The design is adaptable to offer either ski-jump or catapult launch and can be modified to meet Indian Navy and local industry requirements,” the BAE representative explained to Australian Defence . An artist’s conception of a proposed CATOBAR configured HMS Queen Elizabeth . The United Kingdom did not ultimately choose this design., BAE Systems The design may need further adapting to meet any other Indian-specific feature or equipment requirements. For instance, the Queen Elizabeth -class has a notably limited suite of air and missile defense systems, though the Royal Navy is now looking at how to improve those capabilities in the future. India, which faces potential threats from both Pakistan and China , may have immediate demands for a more robust self-protection suite on its ships. The much smaller Vikrant , for instance, will already have four 76mm multi-purpose guns, two 32-cell vertical launch systems for either the Barak 1 or Barak 8 surface-to-air missiles, and a number of Russian 30mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS). But the major advantage of using the Queen Elizabeth as a starting place is that it is a recently produced design that has spent some time at sea. India will build Vishal at the country’s Cochin Shipyard , but could leverage BAE’s production experience to help reduce the chances of serious issues arising during construction and causing major delays. The HMS Queen Elizabeth ., Andrew Matthews—PA Wire/PA Images Just in March 2019, a delegation with Indian Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba at its head visited the United Kingdom. There he toured the Queen Elizabeth and talked with the Royal Navy about best practices for carrier construction. “I am sure we will be able to develop further synergies in our respective future carrier strike capabilities,” First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones, the Royal Navy’s top officer, said afterward. “The important thing is that by developing these capabilities in tandem, we build in a level of interoperability.” This interoperability could be a major boon for the United Kingdom, as well, which is also looking to expand its naval presence , as well as other military activities, in the Pacific Region. In February 2019, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said it had plans to send Queen Elizabeth on a patrol in the hotly contested South China Sea. BAE’s representative at LIMA also told Australian Defence that cooperation with the United Kingdom would help reduce the delivery schedule for Vishal and potential risks. “The distributed build of a large complex carrier, having been successfully demonstrated in the U.K., could potentially assist public and private Indian shipyards in sharing roles and responsibility for construction of this important strategic asset,” he added. All of this would be extremely important given India’s drive for major industrial cooperation in all of its defense procurement, as well as its past experience buying and building aircraft carriers. The Vikramaditya , in particular, was a debacle , with Russia’s Sevmash Shipyard delivering the ship years behind schedule and over budget. Though India purchased the carrier in 2004, it only re-commissioned the heavily modified and overhauled ship in 2013. Sevmash had no previous experience with aircraft carriers or with any ship close to Vikramaditya ’s size. The Soviet Union had built all of its carriers at shipyards in what is now Ukraine and Russians have continually pushed back plans to build new carriers of their own . Vikramaditya in the final stages of construction at Sevmash in 2013., Indian Navy Difficulties with Russian suppliers have also complicated the construction of the future Vikrant. India had to construct facilities to produce the high-grade steel required after difficulties arose in buying the materials from Russia . This past performance can only hurt Russia’s chances for winning any final deal to cooperate on the construction of the future Vishal . The other two firms that India previously contacted about carrier designs, DCNS and Lockheed Martin, also do not have any recent relevant recent designs in service or under construction. DCNS, together with Thales Naval France, had been working on their own 75,000-ton displacement carrier concept derived from the Queen Elizabeth , as a replacement from the French Navy’s carrier Charles de Gaulle , but this program got canceled in 2013. DCNS also built the Charles de Gaulle in the 1980s, but this ship is significantly smaller than what the Indians have called for with the future Vishal . France is only now beginning to conduct new studies regarding a future carrier replacement, which DCNS will certainly be a part of, as well. An artist’s conception of the DCNS Porte-Avions 2 aircraft carrier design, which was based on BAE’s CATOBAR proposal for the Queen Elizabeth -class., DCNS Lockheed Martin has never built a carrier, though it has worked together with Italy’s Fincantieri on various other shipbuilding projects in the past. Fincantieri designed the Italian Navy’s aircraft carrier Cavour , but this a STOVL type that is also substantially smaller than what India is looking for. It is worth mentioning that this Italian shipbuilder has been involved in the development of the propulsion system for the up-coming Vikrant . If India were to select BAE from this field to design its future supercarrier, it would also be significant for the company and the British economy in general, which has slowed significantly in the face of the country’s increasingly convoluted plans to leave the European Union. Even with the Vishal built in India, BAE systems could be looking at decades of subsequent contracts to support the ship’s continued operations and craft future upgrades. Depending on how much commonality there is between the Vishal and the Queen Elizabeth -class, it could help create economies of scale that reduce the sustainment and upgrade costs of the Royal Navy’s carriers, as well. There are already serious questions about whether the Royal Navy has the personnel , operational budgets , escort ships , and aircraft to make the most of its planned two-carrier fleet. This, in turn, has led to persistent, but so far entirely unfounded rumors that the United Kingdom might just sell Queen Elizabeth ‘s sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales , outright to a foreign party, such as India. Of course, India has yet to make any formal decision on who will design, or help design, its future Vishal and it’s unclear when that announcement might come. But BAE does make a very strong case for the first Indian supercarrier to use the Queen Elizabeth as an established starting place.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 29, 2019",Nuclear Device Assembly Facility In Nevada Desert May Be A Ticking Time Bomb (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the most important and high-security facilities in the Department Of Energy’s sprawling nuclear infrastructure portfolio could be a radiation hazard just waiting to occur according to the Chairman of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The fortress-like Device Assembly Facility (DAF) sits about 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas within the highly-security Nevada National Security Site (NNSS)—previously called the Nevada Test Site—near Yucca Dry Lake. The NNSS is surrounded by the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) with shadowy neighbors like Area 51 . The entire area continues to have massive strategic importance as evidenced by a recent Russian surveillance flight directly over the NNSS that occurred according to the rules of the Open Skies treaty. NNSS Powerpoint It turns out that the area is at a much higher risk to powerful seismic activity than the DAF’s designers realized decades ago. Considering that the potentially seismically vulnerable installation houses nuclear material and high explosives, and these compounds are manipulated inside the facility, a large quake could have terrible consequences. The issue was first reported on by Gary Martin of the always great Las Vegas Review Journal. In an official letter to DOE secretary Rick Perry, Chairman Bruce Hamilton states the following: “The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board is concerned that the Department of Energy has not adequately addressed the seismic hazards for the Device Assembly Facility at the Nevada Nationatinal Security Site. The DAF probabilistic seismic hazard analysis update in 2007 identified a significant seismic hazard increase… A seismically induced high explosive violent reaction could result in unmitigated dose consequences to the offsite public… The facility continues to operate without accounting for the increase in seismic hazard and without evaluating whether the credited structures, systems, and components can perform their safety function during and after a seismic event.” Here is the full letter: DNFSB via Scribd The Device Assembly Building is a low-slung, partially buried, extremely high-security, bunker-like structure that is ringed by rows of security fencing and flanked by turrets. Internally it is comprised of various compartments including nuclear storage and device assembly areas, labs, and administrative offices. It was built in the 1980s and has quietly supported America’s nuclear deterrent enterprise ever since, with a history that includes acting in conjunction with live tests at the National Test Site before such events were officially curtailed in 1992. The DAF near Yucca Flats and deep within the NNSS. , DOE An official DOE factsheet offers a fascinating description of the foreboding facility: “For 41 years, nuclear weapons testing was the primary mission during which nuclear testing operations occurred in a safe, remote, and secure environment. These operations included assembly, disassembly, modification, staging, transportation, maintenance, repair, retrofit, and testing of nuclear devices. The mission of the DAF continues evolving since the nuclear weapons testing moratorium began in October 1992. Current missions are an integral part of the U.S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration’s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which includes work to support subcritical experiments, special nuclear material staging, and emergency response training. The DAF is a collection of more than 30 individual steel-reinforced concrete buildings connected by a rectangular common corridor. The entire complex, covered by compacted earth, spans an area of 100,000 square feet. Safety systems include fire detection and suppression, electrical grounding, independent heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems with high-efficiency particulate air filters, alarm systems, and warning lights. In operational areas, pairs of blast doors, designed to mitigate the effects of an explosion, are interlocked so that only one door may open at a time. The operational buildings in the DAF include assembly cells, high bays, assembly bays, one of which houses a glove box, and one of which houses a downdraft table, and radiography bays. Staging bunkers provide space for staging nuclear components and high explosives. All materials packages arrive or depart the DAF through one of two shipping and receiving bays. The support buildings include vaults for staging explosives, or special nuclear material decontamination areas and an administration area with office space, a conference area, personnel changing and shower rooms, and a machine shop. In addition, two buildings provide laboratory space, one for conducting instrumentation and environmental testing and the other for observing operations in an adjacent assembly cell. The assembly cells were named Gravel Gerties after a 1950s comic-strip character. Modeled after the structure at Pantex Plant, these are where hands-on assembly and disassembly of U.S. nuclear weapons and devices would take place. They provide the maximum environmental and personnel protection in the event of an inadvertent high-explosive detonation. The cells are designed to absorb the blast pressure from a detonation of explosives equivalent to 250 kilograms (or 660 pounds) of TNT. Should a detonation occur, the Gravel Gertie would minimize release of nuclear material and its spread to other areas of the facility and to outside areas. The DAF is a national asset. The design of the facility and its safety features makes the DAF well-suited to address new national challenges – such as the National Criticality Experiments Research Center (NCERC) to the NNSS- which supports maintaining the nation’s nuclear stockpile. Additionally, the DAF is used to prepare subcritical experiments and target chambers for the Joint Actinide Shock Physics Experimental Research facility experiments. Currently, the United States is not conducting nuclear tests. However, in 1992 the then President in a Decision Directive pledged to maintain an underground test readiness program in the event that nuclear testing resumes. The DAF is located in the interior of the NNSS and its remoteness provides a substantial safety zone for the general public and adds to the security of the facility. In addition, activities at the DAF comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.” Photos from inside the facility are very limited, but here are some that show a couple of its unique areas: See a diagram of the Gravel Gertie here. , Top: DOE Bottom: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( https://str.llnl.gov/str/Page.html ) In an interesting read posted over at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s webpage, it notes that the facility would also be used to “disable nonstandard explosives, such as a clandestine nuclear device.” A Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board staff report dated November 27th, 2018 discusses the fact that the facility sits on ground that is more unstable than architects realized during its design and construction. It states: “The Board’s staff review team is concerned that DAF continues to operate without incorporating the increased seismic hazard and without analyzing its credited safety-related SSCs to ensure that they can perform their safety function during and after a seismic event. In the DAF documented safety analysis, a high explosive violent reaction (HEVR), or a detonation of high explosives that are co-located with special nuclear material, has the highest public dose consequences that challenge the evaluation guideline and require safety class controls.” The report goes on to talk about all the systems in place to help mitigate risk to the public during an accident and notes that these systems may not meet the current risk requirements. The same goes for the overhead crane systems, ducts, conduits, and other infrastructure contained in the facility. The report includes a somewhat ominous conclusion: “The Board’s staff review team is concerned that DAF continues to operate with the increase in seismic hazard and MSTS has not adequately evaluated credited safety-related SSCs to ensure that they can perform their safety function during and after a seismic event. Seismic accident scenarios at DAF could result in significant consequences to the offsite public. Since the impact of seismic events on DAF SSCs has not been adequately characterized, DAF continues to operate with unknown risk.” All of this is quite timely as America’s aging nuclear infrastructure is taking center stage once again as the Pentagon pivots towards focusing on what it calls “great power competition.” This includes not just modernizing America’s existing nuclear arsenal , but also adding new nuclear capabilities like low-yield tactical nuclear warheads that can be mounted on cruise and ballistic missiles . With new nuclear weapons come the need for billions of dollars worth of testing and development and they have to be assembled and maintained somewhere over the course of their service lives. With these developments in mind, it is quite possible, if not probable, that the DAF will see a substantial uptick in operations in the coming years, not the other way around. Gary Martin of the Las Vegas Review Journal notes in his article that the Nevada Governor’s office is aware of the report and is taking it very seriously. As for revelations about elevated seismic risk to an area that houses many of America’ most secretive and sensitive installations, Martin writes: “The most recent U.S. Geological Survey, in 2008, lists the area that includes the Nevada security site and nearby Yucca Mountain, a proposed nuclear waste repository, as one of moderate to high seismic hazard. Two faults, the Northern Death Valley and the Black Mountains, are located near the Nevada security site and the proposed nuclear waste storage facility. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., said earlier this week following a Senate hearing on the Energy Department’s budget request to jump start licensing to open Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste storage that the site was “seismically unsafe.” America’s Nuclear weapons enterprise has controversial but deep roots in Nevada and nuclear material and warheads are constantly being transported in and out of the state by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s road-borne paramilitary force tasked with protecting their deadly cargo at all costs. This includes rolling across thousands of miles of highway in armored vehicles and heavily customized semi-trailers replete with booby traps and other active defenses. You can read all about this unique force in this past feature of ours. The National Nuclear Security Administration also commands a small army of law enforcement agents and contractors that guard the NNSS and the DAF within it, as well as many other sensitive DOE sites across the United States. They are equipped with heavy armaments that are not traditionally found in the arsenals of other domestic law enforcement outfits. In the case of some sort of nuclear disaster, a number of the DOE’s radiation mapping aircraft and rapid response teams are based in Nevada at Nellis AFB, which is located on the outskirts of nearby Las Vegas. They would be absolutely key in mapping an accidental radiologic release so that officials can try to limit the impact of the disaster through evacuations and/or order citizens to shelter in place. The potential vulnerability of the DAF to earthquakes is just another reminder of America’s rickety nuclear infrastructure that supports the strategic deterrent. Some have said it is not a matter of if but when a major nuclear issue occurs at one of these sites due to lack of maintenance, upgrades, and a robust long-term plan for storing nuclear waste . Even concerns about security in and around America’s nuclear stockpile have been raised. Scares of multiple types have occurred recently , some of which seem to underline these concerns. The fact is that the dawn of nuclear age and the Cold War that followed has left the U.S. speckled with bizarre nuclear sites , most of which the average person would never know existed. But that could rapidly change if a major accident that could have been avoided occurs at one of them… Such as an earthquake near the Device Assembly Building at a very inopportune time. Update: 12:00pm PDT 4/4/2017— We received the following response to our story from the National Nuclear Security Administration: “The concerns expressed by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) about a seismic event at DAF are based on unmitigated radiation dose consequences associated with an explosion induced by an earthquake during nuclear explosive operations when high explosives are in close proximity with large quantities of nuclear material. However, nuclear explosive operations are not authorized at the DAF. Authorized activities involve significantly less nuclear material than would be present for nuclear explosive operations.  Accordingly, the worst case radiation dose associated with current DAF operations, such as subcritical experiment assembly, is significantly less than established dose limits for the public and are far less than that those reported by the DNFSB. Because of the lower magnitude of hazardous materials involved in current operations, the Department concludes that the risks associated with DAF seismic hazards are analyzed and understood. That notwithstanding, NNSS is working to update its analysis. The M&O partner, Mission Support and Test Services (MSTS), at the NNSS has commissioned and completed a revision to the DAF seismic hazard sensitivity analysis, including a peer review. These improved analyses will be used to update the DAF safety analysis in the future, but risks are adequately addressed in the safety analysis for current operations. The half-ton of plutonium shipped from South Carolina is staged in a secure building that prohibits the introduction of high explosives and ensures adequate protection from external explosive events. This material would not be adversely impacted by a seismic event.” The thing that stands out with this response is that the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board did account for the change in the DAF’s use and operation and still found there to be major safety issues, stating: “However, even with removal of the nuclear explosive operations mission, DAF still will have high explosives co-located with special nuclear material. Specifically, part of DAF’s mission is to build subcritical experiments, which includes mating high explosives to special nuclear material. Therefore, the potential for seismically induced HEVR accidents is still credible at DAF. MSTS has not conducted an analysis to determine how the material (i.e., high explosives co-located to special nuclear material) will be reduced and what impacts the reduction will have on the dose consequences for HEVR accidents.” We will reach out to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board for comment on the NNSA’s response.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 4, 2020",Here’s Where Boeing Aims To Take The Super Hornet In The Decades To Come,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Last time we checked in with Boeing about the state of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program, the company had already laid out an impressive plan for the jet’s future based around the new Block III configuration , which promises to significantly expand the combat capabilities of the aircraft. We’ve now had a chance to receive an updated brief from Boeing officials on the Super Hornet program, which points to a bright future for the fighter jet, including additional upgrades and potential foreign sales, through the end of the coming decade and beyond. The War Zone had a chance to sit down and chat with Dan Gillian, the head of Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler programs, at the company’s Washington, D.C. offices about both aircraft on Mar. 27, 2019. At present, the U.S. Navy, the largest single customer for these aircraft, is planning to buy 84 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets between the 2020 and 2024 Fiscal Years, according to its latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year . This is on top of the 24 jets the service received funding for in the previous fiscal cycle. The Navy is not planning on buying any additional Growlers at present, but this could change in the future. Boeing has suggested to the service that an optimal number of EA-18Gs per carrier air wing would be between 8 and 11, rather than the present allotment of five . If the Navy were to pursue this plan, it would have to buy between 24 and 48 additional Growlers in the future to ensure adequate operational capacity. Still, the Chicago-headquartered planemaker already expects to actually deliver 78 Super Hornets to the Navy as part of a new multi-year contract starting in 2020 and ending in 2023, with additional deliveries stretching out to 2026. The Navy’s latest budget documents show that it is expecting to pay around $66 million for each new Super Hornet in the 2020 Fiscal Year. Front to back, an EA-18G Growler, an F/A-18F Super Hornet, and an F/A-18E Super Hornet., Boeing The F/A-18E/F does “continue to enjoy the lowest cost per flight hour of any airplane in the U.S. inventory,” Gillian said, adding that this was around $18,000 per hour at present. Beyond new-build aircraft, the Navy also expects to begin converting a significant portion of its 540 existing Block II F/A-18E/F to the new Block III configuration in 2022. This upgrade program, which also includes a service life modification (SLM) effort to extend the lifespan of these older aircraft, is projected to run through 2033. The total life expectancy of any Block III Super Hornet, new build or updated, will be around 10,000 flight hours, a fifty percent increase over Block II aircraft. A timeline of Boeing’s projected Super Hornet and Growler production as of 2018. Since then, the number of aircraft actually on contract, as well as projected sales, has moved to the right substantially., Boeing Super Hornets in the Block III configuration will have five major upgrades over the previous Block II types. These include are conformal fuel tanks (CFT), updated and added coatings to reduce its radar signature, a set of new mission computers and data links, and a single, readily customizable wide-area multi-function display will go into each cockpit, including the rear seat on two-seat F/A-18F models. In addition, two previously planned upgrades to the Block II Super Hornets are getting rolled in with the Block III program.  These are the ability to carry a modified centerline drop tank with a networked infrared search and track (IRST) sensor and an improved satellite communications (SATCOM) system. You can read more about these updates in detail in The War Zone ‘s past feature on the Block III Super Hornet. Boeing says it plans to deliver a pair of Super Hornet testbeds to the Navy with various Block III features, including the new multi-function displays, later in 2019. This will help the service begin to develop new concepts of operation based on the added capabilities, allow it to begin devising a plan to transition pilots from Block II to Block III aircraft, as well as support the continued development of the other updated features. A general overview of the Block III Super Hornet upgrades., Boeing Earlier in 2019, the Navy already completed Phase I of the testing of the CFTs, which focused on ensuring that the Super Hornet flew as intended with empty tanks fitted. Phase II will involve additional flight testing with the tanks actually full of fuel. Otherwise Boeing says that the development of other Block III features, such as the podded IRST sensor, the added Distributed Targeting Processor-Networked (DTP-N) networking capability to the aircraft’s mission computer, and the new Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) data link, are all on schedule for delivery of the first jets to the Navy. The service expects to reach initial operational capability with the new Super Hornets in 2021 and have one squadron of Block III jets per carrier air wing by 2024. This is set to grow to two squadrons in each carrier air wing three years after that. F/A-18E Super Hornets., Boeing Boeing doesn’t expect the Navy’s Super Hornet upgrade efforts to end with the Block III program. The most significant item that the company is still looking at is the integration of an improved version of the jet’s General Electric F414 engine. “Obviously, every fighter pilot would like more thrust,” Gillian explained. “But when you look at the kill chain, the Block III story more about being a networked fighter and really unlocking the full potential of the IRST sensor and being able to do [sensor] fusion with all of those carrier air wing assets.” But Boeing is in ongoing discussions with both the Navy and General Electric about how to proceed on a new engine, even though there is still no formal re-engining effort in place. General Electric has proposed both “Enhanced Durability” and “Enhanced Performance” concepts in the past, that would increase the life expectancy of the engines and performance. The F414-Enhanced Performance Engine (EPE) offered the potential for a 20 percent increase in thrust. A look at the specifications of the previously proposed F414-EPE engine. , General Electric Other enhancements could be coming to the Super Hornet in the future, including an improved electronic warfare suite for self-defense. The jet lacks a missile approach warning system, which is becoming more common on fighter jets, including Boeing’s own F-15 series, which might be a part of any future self-protection upgrades. There aren’t any firm plans to add hard- or soft-kill active protection systems , such as a directional infrared countermeasures package , but these could be another addition to the defensive suite on Super Hornet or Growler in the future. The Super Hornet does already have an often-overlooked towed decoy system , which the Navy’s latest budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year says is set to get an upgrade of its own in the coming years. Gillian also said that “manned-unmanned teaming” was a “hot topic” of discussion with the U.S. Navy, among other customers and potential customers. A separate Boeing team recently revealed that it had been working with the Australian government on a “ loyal wingman ” type unmanned combat air vehicle that would work with that country’s Super Hornets, as well as its Growlers , among other aircraft. “If you think about an F model Super Hornet, or a Growler, with two aircrew that’s a natural way, a low-risk way to start doing some tactical manned-unmanned teaming work,” Gillian added. The networking and sensor fusion capabilities that the DTP-N and TTNT upgrades offer already provide the “building blocks” for this kind of capability in the future, he explained. He also noted that many potential customers are still working on outlining what they might want out of a future team-up of manned tactical aircraft and drones. In that same vein, the U.S. military as a whole is looking to increasing integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning into its operations. Super Hornet and Growler might take advantage of these developments in the future. Gillian specifically mentioned the possibility of “ cognitive electronic attack ” being an option for the Growler, which would involve future systems that could detect, categorize, and and then adapt to new threats, including emitters, such as radars or communications nodes, using previously unknown waveforms, all right in the middle of a mission. There are things that Boeing says are unlikely to end up on any future Super Hornet variant in the end, too. Previous stealthy concepts involving an IRST sensor integrated into the airframe and enclosed weapons pods, have fallen by the wayside since they first appeared in the company’s proposal for an Advanced Super Hornet in 2013. This aircraft was also referred to as the International Roadmap Super Hornet. The enclosed sensor pod, seen here on Boeing’s Advanced Super Hornet demonstrator, is one of the things that Gillian said hadn’t “earned” its way into the present future planning for the fighter jet., Boeing “When you talk stealth, and you’re thinking in the [2020s] and beyond, you have to be stealthy to survive, but just being stealthy will not ensure your survival ,” Gillian said. “The threat has figured out how to counter stealth and, obviously, having it is essential, because it does give you advantages, but having to have the highest level of stealth has somewhat been marginalized down to a few niche missions.” “We continue to say that the right level of stealth – which is where we think we’re at with the Super Hornet, with the Block III Super Hornet – is what the carrier air wing and air forces around the world need to cover the widest swath of missions that a Super Hornet can cover,” he continued. “And then you have the Block III Super Hornet with a long-range IRST sensor – can see a stealth airplane just fine. So as people get more comfortable with that technology, you have to have a more balanced approach to survivability.” A rendering of Lockheed Martin’s IRST21 sensor and an associated environmental control unit from Meggitt Defense Industry integrated into a GE Aviation FPU-13 drop tank. The Block III Super Hornets will be able to carry this store., Lockheed Martin Some or all of the Block III F/A-18E/F upgrades may eventually make their way to the EA-18Gs, as well. The DTP-N and TTNT started life on the Growler to begin with, before making their way to the Super Hornet upgrade program. Boeing is now looking at the possibility of an Advanced Growler, which the Navy is tentatively referring to as a Block II Growler, that would include the other updates, such as the wide-area cockpit displays and CFTs. The latter addition could be especially valuable for the Growlers, given that these jamming aircraft have to lug around multiple electronic warfare pods, reducing their overall endurance and limiting the available stores stations to carry additional fuel in drop tanks. “I can certainly see a strong case for a Growler with an enhanced engine, if for no other reason than to generate more electrical power,” Gillian said. The EA-18G could definitely see its demands for electrical power generation grow in the coming years, depending on how the Navy’s multi-part Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) program proceeds. You can read more about the development of these new electronic warfare pods in this past feature . An EA-18G Growler with a full load., USN The Navy’s major investments in the Block III Super Hornet also make Boeing “optimistic” about future foreign sales. The planned American purchases have “certainly given a lot of confidence to international customers,” Gillian said. Kuwait, which has 22 F/A-18Es and six F/A-18Fs on order already, has actually helped fund a number of parts of the Block III program. The Kuwaiti jets will be in a sort of hybrid configuration between Block II and III, receiving some of the upgrades, such as the wide-area cockpit displays. The first of this batch of aircraft is set to fly for the first time in the coming months. Super Hornets, with various Block III features, are also on offer for current and upcoming fighter competitions in Canada, Finland, Germany, India, Poland, and Switzerland, among others. In many cases, these deals might potentially end up tied together with sales of Growlers, too.  Growlers would offer any new operator a quantum leap in electronic warfare capabilities. Finland is in the process of looking for a replacement for its aging F-18C/D Hornets . Gillian specifically highlighted that the U.S. government had recently approved the sale of EA-18Gs to Finland, along with F/A-18E/Fs, which he felt made the company’s offer to that country particularly strong. “We think that’s a great combination for Finland given the threat environment they operate in,” he said, a nod to the Scandinavian country’s increasingly tense relationship with Russia . A Finnish F-18C refuels while an F-18D flies behind., USAF Boeing also plans to offer Growlers to Germany, along with Super Hornets, as the replacement for that country’s fleet of Tornado combat jets, though the U.S government has not yet approved this possible sale of EA-18Gs. The replacement of German Tornados has been its own saga, which you can read about more here , but the country is now set to decide between buying the Super Hornet, possibly with the addition of Growler in the future, or more Eurofighter Typhoons . Gillian noted that Germany’s Tornado fleet includes a number of examples of the Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance variant, or ECR, which has added equipment specifically for the suppression of enemy air defenses mission (SEAD), including sensors to spot and locate enemy radars and other emitters. This is one of Growler’s missions sets, as well, which would make it an ideal replacement for those particular aircraft, while also providing a massive boost in electronic warfare capabilities for the Germany Air Force, overall. There is still a nagging question about when any Tornado replacement might be able to perform the Tornado’s present nuclear mission. As part of an inter-NATO agreement , Germany’s Tornado’s are certified to carry U.S. B61 nuclear gravity bombs if required. An official diagram showing the loadout for a Tornado during tests to determine its suitability as a delivery platform for the new B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb ., Sandia National Laboratories Neither Super Hornet nor Typhoon is presently nuclear certified, which could lead to a pause in Germany’s participation in the nuclear sharing deal. “We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German’s] timeline,” Gillian said regarding this issue. Boeing is still eyeing a possible Super Hornet sale to Canada. Canada had previously planned to buy F/A-18E/Fs as an interim solution to its growing fighter jet woes, which you can read about more here , but this ran afoul of a trade dispute between Boeing and Canadian company Bombardier. The Canadians subsequently made a controversial purchase of ex-Australian F/A-18A/B Hornets as a stopgap measure instead. Super Hornet is still in the running for the future contract to replace Canada’s existing Hornet fleet outright. Boeing is of the view that the jets, especially with at least some Block III features, such as the podded IRST and CFTs, would be well suited to the Canadian mission, which has a major air defense component. Canadian jets with the added endurance of the CFTs and increased ability to spot stealthy aircraft at long range using the IRST could be a boon for defending North America from outside threats as part of the U.S.-Canada North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). They would also be valuable for supporting rotating air policing missions in Europe as part of NATO. A Royal Canadian Air Force CF-18A+ Hornet., RCAF Super Hornets will also be flying in Switzerland later in 2019 as part of that country’s competition to replace its existing F/A-18C/D Hornets, as well as its remaining F-5E/F Tiger IIs. The Swiss have already retired the bulk of their F-5s, with the U.S. Navy now asking for money in the 2020 Fiscal Year to buy more than 20 Tiger IIs sitting in storage in Switzerland to support its adversary training requirements, as well as that of the U.S. Marine Corps . Beyond that, Super Hornet is in the running for two major contracts in India. The Indian Navy is looking to buy dozens of new carrier-based fighter jets to support the country’s future aircraft carrier plans and the Indian Air Force has a standing requirement for more than 100 new fighter jets to replace various aging types, including its heavily upgraded Soviet-era MiG-21 Bisons . Unfortunately, Indian defense procurement is its own saga, which you can read about in more depth here , and it is unclear exactly when that country might make a final decision in either case. An infographic laying out Boeing’s pitch to the Indian Air Force for its future contract, which includes significant requirements for industrial cooperation with Indian firms., Boeing All told, though the Navy remains Boeing’s best Super Hornet customer, the future of the jet, as well as the Growler, looks bright, both in terms of additional capabilities down the road and growing sales abroad. The big questions about whether any of these aircraft will get a new engine or if the Growlers might get the CFTs are still unanswered, but there are increasingly strong incentives in both cases. Additional sales overseas could prompt further demands for these improvements and help the Navy shift some of the cost burdens of developing them onto other partners.  As noted, the sales of more advanced Super Hornets to Kuwait already helped facilitate the development of the full Block III configuration. The networking and sensor fusion capabilities found in the Block III, combined with future improvements to the self-protection features on the Super Hornet and Growler, will only help keep the aircraft relevant for years to come. The jets that Boeing delivers in the next decade may also find themselves working directly with unmanned aircraft. USN All of this is a major turnaround for the Super Hornet, even just compared to how things were even two years ago. Before defense spending significantly increased under President Donald Trump’s Administration, Boeing was concerned that it might have to close down the entire production line . Things are very different now. With this year marking the 20th anniversary of the F/A-18E/F’s entry into U.S. service, the prospects look good for the Super Hornet, as well as the Growler, to still be going strong on its 30th birthday. Correction: The article originally said that Super Hornet costs are rising. The unit cost that the U.S. Navy is paying will drop significantly between the 2019 Fiscal Year and the upcoming 2020 Fiscal Year. Boeing has also now revealed that the full life expectancy of new Block III jets and upgraded aircraft will be around 10,000 flight hours rather than “over 9,000 flight hours.” Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Drones"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",U.S. Special Operators Want New Armored Vehicles To Replace Their Obscure Austrian Ones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Special Operations Command has laid out the first basic requirements for a new light armored vehicle to give elite American forces added protection, firepower, and mobility over even their heaviest mine-resistant trucks. These would replace an obscure fleet of Austrian-designed wheeled armored vehicles that the U.S. Army’s Delta Force , among others, has utilized over the past two decades. They could also supplant the Stryker armored vehicles assigned to that service’s 75th Ranger Regiment, which made a notable appearance in northern Syria two years ago. Logan Kittinger, Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Deputy Program Manager for Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV), first revealed the Next Generation Armored Ground Mobility System (AGMS) program at the National Defense Industry Association’s (NDIA) annual Tactical Wheeled Vehicles Conference on Feb. 4, 2019. Kittinger’s briefing notes that SOCOM is expecting to continue developing the requirements for the new armored vehicle, as well as looking at what existing options are available, into 2020. However, it does outline some key features that the special operations forces are looking for already. The final design will have to be able to carry between nine and 10 passengers and have a total payload capacity of 4,500 pounds or more. The vehicle will have to fit inside a C-130-series transport aircraft , as well. The slide on the Next Generation Armored Ground Mobility System from the February 2019 briefing., SOCOM This is similar in many respects to the existing AGMS, which is a variant of the 6×6 Pandur I light armored vehicle that Austrian conglomerate Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeuge, or SSF, first developed the in the 1980s. These vehicles have a crew of two and can carry seven additional personnel. They have a gross weight of around 30,000 pounds and are also C-130 transportable. Beyond that, the requirements for the Next Generation AGMS call for an unspecified “heavy weapons capability” using a remote weapon station, and a desire for “improved situational awareness.” Though not specific, these both point to a demand for special operators to be able to operate effectively from within the confines of the vehicle with its hatches closed. This would be a major boost in capability over the existing vehicles, which feature an open-topped, manned turret and have very limited visibility for any personnel within the vehicle. The current AGMS configuration does have the option to mount a fully-enclosed armored glass cupola for the driver that offers added protection and improved visibility for operations with their hatch open, but this still requires that individual to be more exposed than they would be if they were riding fully enclosed with the vehicle’s armored body. A rare picture of an Armored Ground Mobility System vehicle, which is, in this case, equipped with the ballistic glass cupola for the driver., DOD A remote weapon station with an electro-optical and infrared targeting system would also offer the ability for added situational awareness while operating in a buttoned-down configuration, but only in the direction that the turret is facing. Added optics, or even a more advanced remote vision system consisting of cameras placed around the vehicle, would offer additional visibility. This would be valuable, especially in an urban environment, where threats might quickly pop up to attack a blind spot from one or more directions before darting back behind cover. Improved situational awareness could also involve the installation of improved communications and networking capabilities. This would allow the crew to quickly share information about their position, enemy movements, and other items of interest to build a better picture of the battlefield around them. A remote weapon station could be an easy path to adding increased firepower, as well. The original AGMS can only carry one heavy weapon, such as a .50 caliber M2 machine gun, 40mm Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher, or TOW anti-tank missile launcher at a time. As of 2017, at least one had received a remote weapon station of its own. But the U.S. Army is now in the process of fielding newer and still relatively lightweight remote weapon stations that combine an M2 or Mk 19 with a Javelin anti-tank missile launcher. Depending on the exact design SOCOM chooses for its future vehicle, it might come equipped with a light automatic cannon . A remote weapon station on US Army Stryker armored vehicle equipped with a .50 caliber M2 machine gun and a Javelin anti-tank missile., US Army But, if nothing else, the Next Generation AGMS program offers SOCOM a chance to obtain an overall more modern light armored vehicle and potentially expand the fleet size for what is a niche capability at present. Until U.S. special operations forces began receiving the first generation of mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) armored trucks in the mid-to-late 2000s, the Pandur-based AGMS vehicles were the heaviest and best-protected means for these elite forces to get around. The exact history of the AGMS is somewhat murky, as is that of its primary operator, Delta Force. This unit’s experience in Somalia in 1993, especially during the running battle in that country’s capital Mogadishu on Oct. 3-4, 1993 , was almost certainly a contributing factor in its decision to acquire a light armored vehicle. This event, in which Somali militia men notably shot down multiple Black Hawk helicopters, resulted in pockets of Delta operators and other American special operations forces scattered across the city. Attempts to use additional helicopters and a convoy of unarmored vehicles failed and the United States had to turn to the United Nations force in the country, which included contingents with light armored vehicles, for assistance. Malaysian 4×4 Condor armored personnel carriers in Somalia in 1992 or 1993. Condors were part of the force that ultimately helped rescue American special operators during the Battle of Mogadishu on Oct. 3-4, 1993., CT Snow via Wikimedia In 1999, the Army awarded a $51 million contract to A.V. Technology, working with both General Dynamics Land Systems and SFF, for up to 50 AGMS. This team of companies reportedly only delivered 12 of the vehicles under this contract in 2000. SOCOM then received a second tranche of 11 vehicles in 2006. Task Force Wolverine, with Delta Force in the lead, used the AGMS along with various other vehicles in the initial stages of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to Leigh Neville’s Special Operations Patrol Vehicles : Afghanistan and Iraq . The AGMS were involved in the infamous mission to recover U.S. Army Private Jessica Lynch after her convoy got ambushed by Iraqi forces on Mar. 23, 2003, during the Battle of Nasiriyah . The vehicles continued to see use in the subsequent American-led occupation of Iraq, supporting operations to detain high-value insurgents. An AGMS is seen at around 2:05 in the runtime of this montage of clips from the mission to recover U.S. Army Private Jessica Lynch from Saddam Hospital in Nasiriyah on April 1, 2003. But even with the adoption of steadily more capable MRAPs, the AGMS has remained one of the more heavily armored vehicles organic to the special operations community and is certainly among the most capable of operating off-road. The only other traditional armored vehicles in service with U.S. special operations forces are the 8×8 Strykers within the 75th Ranger Regiment, which that unit received starting in 2005 . These Strykers continue to offer an important capability for special operations units, especially when operating in areas where there is a greater risk of encountering conventional forces with heavier weaponry. In 2017, the Rangers sent the vehicles to the area around the hotly contested northern Syrian city of Manbij . Ranger Strykers near Manbij in 2017., AP There they helped keep a buffer between Turkish troops and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, while also offering added protection against potential attacks from elements aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. Though not as widely reported on at the time, at least two AGMS were also spotted in Syria in 2017, too. An AGMS equipped with a TOW missile launcher is seen in a larger American convoy in northern Syria near the end of the video below. With the U.S. military refocusing on preparations for large-scale conflicts against “great power” competitors, such as Russia and China, there could be an increased demand for this type of armored vehicle within the U.S. special operations community. Increased concerns about the possibility of a major armed confrontation after Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 has already led to an armored vehicle renaissance among conventional American units . None of this is to say that special operations forces will be launching full-on armored assaults in the future. But a Next Generation AGMS would provide them with better protection and firepower that could be useful for conducting unconventional warfare operations against more conventional opponents , as well as just executing general movements on the sidelines of any future large conflict. Though it’s too early to tell what vehicles SOCOM might be interested in for its next light armored vehicle, it might make sense in the interim to simply acquire additional Strykers. These vehicles are in production and have benefited from a variety of Army-funded upgrades . Another option might be to acquire lighter 8×8 LAV-25 vehicles from the U.S. Marine Corps. The Army’s 82nd Airborne Division has already gone this route as part of its effort to add additional protection and firepower during airborne operations. Both of these vehicles are significantly larger than the Pandur, which might make them less attractive as a direct replacement for the AGMS. A new vehicle with a similar footprint to the existing AGMS could have the advantage of being able to operate more discreetly than a larger design, as well as maneuver through tighter spaces, especially in an urban environment. A lighter vehicle might also be easier for special operations forces to support logistically, especially during extended duration operations separated from more established supply lines. Regardless, SOCOM says it wants to formally begin the process of acquiring the Next Generation AGMS sometime between 2022 and 2023. It will be interesting to see how the special operations community’s requirements and expectations for its next light armored vehicle evolve and solidify in the coming years.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jan 10, 2019",This Is What The Boom Operator’s Station On The New KC-46 Tanker Actually Looks Like,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Probably the most controversial feature on the USAF’s new KC-46 Pegasus tanker is its Aerial Refueling Operator Station (AROS). The KC-46 abandoned the tried and true boom pod that puts the boom operator looking out the back of the jet through a window and replaced it with a series of multi-spectral cameras distributed around the aircraft and a hybrid 3D/2D remote system for operating the boom itself. The operators sit in the front of the aircraft at a two-person station that looks like something out of drone command trailer more than a high-flying gas station. In the past, we have seen photos of the system mocked up on the ground and in simulators, now Altus AFB has published a variety of images showing off the real McCoy during an actual mission. AROS includes three main displays in front of each operator. The top set of displays is for situational awareness around the aircraft’s rear hemisphere. It is especially well suited for monitoring probe-equipped aircraft that are refueling via the aircraft’s centerline hose and drogue unit and the two podded units that will eventually be available to the Pegasus tanker. A number of them were supposed to be delivered with the initial aircraft, but to our knowledge, they are behind schedule due to flight certification issues and will not be delivered for some time. Boeing The central 2D/3D display replicates the boomer’s view out the back of the aircraft for boom refueling operations. The boom, which operates via fly-by-wire controls, is flown with control sticks mounted on either side of each boom operator’s console. A third display, which is a heads-down unit, provides critical data related to the aircraft’s configuration and fueling operations. As you can see, the boom operators also use their tablets during missions. A wide variety of controls surround these display units, some of which are shared between the operator stations that are connected via a central console. One advantage with the system is that boom operators can execute their mission in total darkness, with both aircraft blacked out visible light-wise. In the past, specially equipped KC-135RTs and highly trained crews focused on this type of refueling. You can read all about the shy world of Special Operations Aerial Refueling in this special feature of ours . At the same time, the system has proven to be highly troublesome and is set to undergo a major overhaul.

It shows a rearward aspect of the KC-46’s AROS., U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. David Bernal Del Agua The KC-46’s development has been troubled, to say the least, but the Remote Vision System (RVS) that feeds video to the AROS has been at the very center of some of the most significant issues . Previous testing showed that there is a small, but problematic difference between what the boom operator sees and what might actually be happening at the tail end of the aircraft. “There is a slight difference between the motion viewed in the RVS versus what is actually occurring in the physical world,” an Air Force official told Defense News in January 2019. “All of those things can create a depth compression and curvature effect.” Any shadows, glare , or other similar factors might impact what the boom operator actually sees, causing them to over-compensate and swing the boom around erratically. This could put dangerous strain on the boom itself or increase the risk that it might strike the receiving aircraft, the latter being a particularly worrisome issue when working with stealth aircraft and their sensitive radar absorbing skins. KC-46 about to refuel a C-17. , U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Laura Beckley In addition, the hybrid 2D-3D system requires the use of stereoscopic glasses to get the full effect, just like watching a modern 3D movie in a theater. Studies have warned that this might lead to increased instances of eye strain, headaches, vertigo, and other vision issues, especially among individuals already predisposed to those issues. So, when the Air Force accepted the first KC-46 in January 2019, it did so after Boeing agreed to completely overhaul the RVS at its own cost. This will include hardware changes, including new camera lenses and computer processing capability, as well as software fixes, among other things, according to Jane’s 360 . Just developing the fully revised RVS could take between three and four years, according to the Air Force and there’s no timeline yet for how long it might take to integrate those changes into any aircraft the service has already accepted up to that point. Of course, the delivery schedule has already been beset by delays. USAD photo by Tech. Sgt. Kenneth Norman Another major and seemingly flagrant issue with the aircraft has also popped up recently, one that has nothing to do with the plane’s development issues. In February 2019 , Boeing halted KC-46 flight activities at its Washington state plant after finding loose tools and other foreign object debris inside the airframes of completed jets. Air Force personnel were at the facility at the time conducting flight training. On Mar. 1, 2019, the Air Force confirmed that it had stopped accepted new KC-46s altogether over these issues. Less than two weeks later, though, the service began taking deliveries of the tankers again, after Boeing agreed to a 13-step corrective plan . Then on Apr. 2, 2019, the Air Force revealed that it had again suspended accepting any more KC-46s more than week earlier due to more FOD turning up in completed aircraft. At the time of writing, the service is still refusing to take delivery of any more tankers until Boeing implements additional correction actions. The good news is that these cost overruns, which have added up to a sum in the billions of dollars, are all on Boeing as they executed a fixed price contract for the jets. Still, further delays and capability issues will impact the USAF plans adversely in myriad ways and can hurt the flying force’s power projection capabilities when it needs them most. At the same time, competitors Airbus and Lockheed have joined forces to provide potential alternatives to future KC-46 acquisitions. Clearly, they smell blood considering the USAF’s unhappy disposition over the ongoing issues with its new tanker. So even though the KC-46 is technically flying for the USAF today, a vision of what’s to come for the tanker still isn’t crystal clear.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 4, 2019",U.S. Withholding F-35 From Turkey Could Give Russia The Chance It Needs To Export SU-57,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I don’t think anyone would claim it came as a surprise, but nonetheless, the U.S. deciding to hold back NATO ally Turkey’s F-35 order and potentially curtailing its industrial involvement in the program is a major development. It’s also one that is nearly certain to push Turkey further into Moscow’s orbit and could offer Russia a unique and much-needed opportunity to export their Su-57 advanced fighter. On March 1st, 2019, Department of Defense spokesman Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews stated the following: “Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability have been suspended.” Reuters reported that the next shipment of training equipment and all other F-35 related material to Turkey has been canceled. Acting Pentagon spokesman Charles Summers Jr. added more detail regarding the decision: “The United States has been clear that Turkey’s acquisition of the S-400 is unacceptable… Until they forgo delivery of the S-400, the United States has suspended deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability. Should Turkey procure the S-400, their continued participation in the F-35 program is at risk.” Summers also added that the Pentagon is now actively looking for other sources to provide the Turkish-built parts currently being used on the F-35 in a move to protect “the resiliency supply chain” and “the shared investments in our critical technology.” Congress is also working on tough legislation that could crystalize the Turkish F-35 embargo permanently. The U.S. is at odds with its long-time ally over a number of issues , but Ankara’s final decision to proceed with the purchase of the Russian-built S-400 air defense system is the driving factor behind the course correction. It is an issue we have followed very closely and you can read all about in our latest of many articles on the topic linked here . Suffice it to say that the technological and intellectual property risk of having a military operate America’s most advanced fighter jet and Russia’s most advanced air defense system concurrently is extremely high. Presumably, it would give the Russian’s unprecedented insight into the F-35’s systems, capabilities, and operating concepts. USAF Last week it became clear that Ankara has no intentions of backing down from its purchase of the S-400 system even as U.S. diplomats and Pentagon officials have made a full court press to get Turkey to purchase the U.S.-built Patriot system instead. The offer to sell the Patriot to Turkey expired formally on March 31, 2019. In some ways, the S-400 purchase has acted as a fulcrum of sorts to showcase Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s independence from Washington’s influence—a narrative that has been increasingly cultivated since the failed military coup against Erdogan in the Summer of 2016. To this day, pro-Erdogan elements within the Turkish government accused the U.S. of being behind the operation without any hard evidence to back up such claims. For the Kremlin, the news that the U.S. is suspending significant portions of Turkey’s involvement in the F-35 program, including potentially the fairly lucrative inclusion of Turkey’s aerospace and defense industrial base in it, couldn’t have come at a better time. Russia is now aggressively and very vocally trying to find a new export partner for its Su-57 fighter after India pulled the plug on its participation in the program. UAC Aircraft Russia, whose military has found itself increasingly cash-strapped , cannot afford these aircraft in significant numbers and will need an external revenue source to achieve any economies of scale with the type. Even its continued development may be increasingly in question without an export customer. Turkey was set to buy 100 F-35. As such, it was one of the type’s largest customers. If Russia could secure that size of order for its Su-57 it would be a huge coup for the struggling program and could allow Russia to buy more of the jets itself than the dozen developmental aircraft it has currently and about another dozen on order. Specialized munitions development for the type could also be accelerated. Russia could also offer extensive industrial offsets to fill the gap that the F-35 would leave behind and possibly even much more. Direct technology transfer is also possible. Turkey would find this extremely attractive as it continues to work on its own 5th generation fighter aircraft, the TF-X, that isn’t slated to be delivered until the early 2030s at the soonest. Above all else, the Su-57, or even a combination of Su-57s and Su-35s , would be able to be directly integrated with the S-400 air defense system without caveat. AP We must underscore that the Su-57 is no F-35, but it does have some unique features that make it a formidable fighter assuming they all operate as advertised. You can read our whole analysis on the Su-57 and how it is chronically misunderstood in this past feature of ours . Turkey currently flies a mix of two American fighter types. It continues to operate aging F-4 Phantoms that are in need of replacement and is one of the world’s largest operators of the F-16 Viper. There is also talk that Russia is eyeing China as a possible export customer for their notional “Su-57E.” That would be a puzzling choice for Beijing, a country that has two stealth fighter designs already flying , one of which is in service . But China may be willing to buy a batch of the jets anyway. They have made similar moves in the past, such as the purchase of Su-35s even though a number of Flanker clones are being produced indigenously. If Russia was willing to share critical engine technology with China—an area of expertise in which China is still lagging behind its competitors and their major aerospace programs are suffering as a result—could in itself push Beijing to become and Su-57E operator. There is even a glimmer of renewed hope that India would come back to the table and rejoin the program after the loss of a MiG-21 Bison during a high-profile aerial skirmish with Pakistan that occurred in late February. Still, this is a longshot as India has multiple fighter import programs ongoing as well as what looks like an order for additional Su-30MKIs and refurbished MiG-29s to help offset continued losses of its geriatric MiG-21 and MiG-27 fleets. So, as you can see, Turkey could become a very exciting Su-57 export opportunity for Russia if Ankara continues to move away from the U.S. and its NATO allies, and certainly rumblings of such a sale have been ongoing for some time. Doing so would also help Moscow deepen the divide between NATO and one of its most powerful member states. UAC Aircraft The big question remains just how far will Turkey’s slide away from the alliance that helped define it as a modern military power. All this also puts into question the U.S.-Turkish relationship as a whole. What on earth is the U.S. doing having deployed tactical nuclear weapons in a country it no longer can trust even to even operate its latest export fighter—one that is being bought by a significant number of allies, with Singapore being the latest country to sign up for the stealth jets. Additionally, the situation also should raise concerns about the technological risk posed by Turkey’s large existing fleet of advanced American combat aircraft types, which includes the highly advanced E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft and Block 50 F-16C/Ds. Clearly, the U.S. is preparing for an age in which Turkey is no longer considered a close ally, one in which using its airspace and Incirlik Air Base as a staging point for military operations in the region no longer exists. Case in point, America’s plans to drastically expand its air base facilities in Jordan. But logistics are only one part of an avalanche of issues a non-aligned Turkey could bring on, the largest of which have to do with the country’s future membership in the NATO alliance. In the meantime, the country won’t be receiving any F-35s and the handful that have already been delivered will be put into storage until further notice. We will keep you up to date as this saga unfolds.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 23, 2019",This Is The Army’s New Submachine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The American subsidiary of Swiss gunmaker B&T has won a multi-million-dollar contract to supply the U.S. Army with a variant of its 9mm APC9 submachine gun. For almost a year, the service has been evaluating a number of proposed weapons as part of an effort to give personal security details added firepower . The Army quietly announced that it had awarded B&T USA the deal, worth more than $2.5 million, on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps on Mar. 29, 2019, but did not specify which weapon specifically it was buying. A trusted source familiar with the contract confirmed the gun in question was a version of the APC9 PRO series , but could not say which model specifically. The Army now expects to purchase at least 350 of what it officially calls the Sub Compact Weapon, or SCW, with additional options to buy up to 1,000 of the guns in total. The order also includes unspecified accessories, spare parts, and services. The Army initially kicked off the SCW competition in May 2018, before canceling the project and quickly rebooting it in a revised form two months later . Along with B&T USA, its Swiss-headquartered parent company had also entered the SCW competition itself in partnership with Trident Rifles . The Army passed on that bid, along with other offers from Angstadt Arms , Global Ordnance , Shield Arms , and Sig Sauer all of which submitted entries, as well. Reports in 2018 had indicated that B&T, through Trident Rifles, had initially offered a variant of the company’s MP9 machine pistol . However, this gun has a side-folding stock, which would have disqualified it under the Army’s revised requirements. Though we don’t know the exact configuration of the guns the Army is now buying, the APC9 PRO family of guns already includes a variant, the APC9 PRO K, that meets a number of the Army’s requirements, such as a barrel shorter than five and a half inches, a weight under seven pounds, and a stock that retracts and extends rather than folds to the side. B&T presently offers this gun with only a semi-automatic fire option, while any Army version would have a fully automatic mode. The APC9 PRO K., B&T The PRO upgrades to the original APC9 series, which B&T was developing right as the Army’s SCW program was getting underway, might have made the Swiss gun attractive in many ways over its competitors. Most notably, the improved variant features a modular lower assembly that comes in three different flavors to accept different types of magazines. B&T also offers a wide array of other optional accessories to go with the updated design. The standard version uses B&T’s proprietary magazine design. There are two others available that can accept Glock pistol magazines and those for the Sig Sauer P320 series. The latter is particularly notable given that, in 2017 , the Army picked versions of the P320 as its new standard sidearms as part of the Modular Handgun System (MHS) program. A graphic showing the various components available for the APC9 PRO series, including the lower receiver that works with Sig Sauer P320 magazines., B&T This means that the Army’s version of the APC9 could use the same ammunition and magazines as its new standard issue pistols. This would give any individual equipped with the SCW immediate magazine commonality between their primary and secondary weapon, which could be extremely valuable in even a brief firefight. It would also allow personnel with one of the submachine guns to exchange magazines back and forth with individuals who are only armed with a pistol, if necessary. Beyond that, it would help reduce logistical requirements for the new submachine guns. The service does say the SCWs will need to have 20 and 30 round magazines, but it is already buying 21-round P320 magazines as part of the MHS program and there are 30-round options available on the market. This might also make the submachine guns attractive for personal security details, and any other units with a requirement for this kind of compact firepower, across the U.S. military. The full-size MHS pistol, now known as the M17, and the compact version, or M18 , are set to become the default sidearm across all the branches . Glock pistols have also become increasingly popular with various specialized units , especially special operations forces , and a variant of the SCW that uses the same magazines as those guns might also be of interest. Extended 21-round magazines for the Sig Sauer P320 loaded with ammunition during the Army’s MHS pistol trials., US Army But the Army’s decision to acquire any new pistol-caliber submachine gun, a category of firearms that has been becoming steadily obsolete in military and law enforcement circles, especially due to its limited ability to penetrate body armor,  for years now, remains curious. There are an increasing number of ultra-compact rifle-caliber weapons available, along with specialized cartridges, such as the increasingly popular .300 Blackout , to help maximize the effectiveness of these short-barreled guns. On top of that, there are more novel purpose-built personal defense weapons that are specifically intended to meet the kind of physical requirements the Army has laid out and that offer better range and armor-piercing capability over a 9mm gun. The U.S. Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six reportedly already uses the 4.7mm Heckler and Koch MP7 , while the U.S. Secret Service is a notable user of the 5.7mm FN P90 . A US Army soldier fires an MP7 personal defense weapon during an exchange event with German troops in Afghanistan., US Army Beyond the aforementioned logistical benefits, the primary benefit of an APC9-based SCW for personal security details would seem to be primarily the added volume of fire and magazine depth compared to their pistols. The submachine guns will also be more accurate than pistols, thanks in large part to the stock, at any kind of appreciable distance. Though personal security details often work in close quarters, this doesn’t mean that they might not find easily themselves in a more open area. Sticking with 9mm might reduce the potential for bullets over-penetrating and endangering innocent bystanders in extremely close quarters environments, such as inside a building. The new submachine guns will also be able to make use of the improved ammunition, including the new XM1153 hollow point rounds , that the Army is buying as part of the MHS program. From left to right, the XM1152 ball ammunition, the XM1153 jacketed hollow point cartridges, and the XM1156 dummy rounds that the Army has adopted as part of the MHS pistol program. Not seen are any examples of the XM1157 blank cartridge, which completes the family of new 9mm ammunition., Joseph Trevithick That’s not to say there isn’t a need to give personal security details protecting high-value individuals added firepower to respond to any potential threats, especially from insider attacks. The Army’s had released its revised program requirements less than a month after an Afghan Army soldier murdered one Army soldier on a security detail assignment and wounded two others. In October 2018 , another insider attack almost claimed the life of the top American general in Afghanistan. It’s a potential threat that’s hardly limited to that particular theater of operations, either. In recent years, insider attacks have also led to the death or injury of American servicemembers in Jordan and Syria . This is all on top of the threats of more traditional terrorist attacks and other kinds of violence that high-profile American military and civilian officials might face while working overseas. Just traveling between locations can be risky in many cases. Protective detail operations that might involve having to rapidly get in and out of a vehicle , or engage targets from within one, are where compact weapons, such as the Army’s future SCW, really shine. We don’t know how long it will be before Army personal security details begin receiving their new B&T guns, but given the relative speed of the contracting process, we could begin to see them in the hands of troops downrange in the near future. In the meantime, The War Zone will be keeping its eyes out for more details on the service’s new submachine gun.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Aug 12, 2020",U.S. Amphibious Assault Ship In South China Sea With Unprecedentedly Large Load of F-35Bs,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s first-in-class amphibious assault ship USS Wasp recently arrived in the Philippines for a major annual exercise carrying a U.S. Marine Corps contingent that includes at least 10 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . This is a larger than average number of the combat jets than Wasp -class ships normally embark, but is a force structure that the Navy and Marines are looking to standardize. It’s also one that could help lay the groundwork for a future operating concept that could turn amphibious assault ships into light carriers , as necessary. Wasp entered the Philippine port of Subic Bay on Mar. 30, 2019 , ahead of the beginning of Exercise Balikatan 2019. The ship is carrying Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Four (SPMAGTF 4), with the 4th Marine Regiment as the lead unit. The drills have occurred almost every year since 1991 , with the exception of a hiatus between 1995 and 1999 due to a protracted dispute over the legal status of American troops deployed to the country during the exercise. “During Balikatan 2019, U.S. and Philippine forces will conduct amphibious operations, live-fire training, urban operations, aviation operations, and counterterrorism response,” according to an official Navy statement . “[ Wasp and SPMAGTF 4] Participating in Balikatan demonstrates their ability to quickly forward deploy in support of an ally should a crisis or natural disaster occur.” This deployment is already notable since it is the first time F-35Bs, in any quantity, will take part in these drills. But it also appears to be one of the first times, if not the first time, a Marine task force has embarked aboard an amphibious assault ship with an air combat element, or ACE, in this particular F-35 heavy configuration. USS Wasp pulls into Subic Bay on Mar. 30, 2019. A total of 10 F-35Bs are visible on deck, as well as two MH-60S helicopters., USN From what we can see on deck, Wasp ’s current complement includes at least 10 F-35Bs from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron One Two One (VMFA-121), as well as four MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors from Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron Two Six Eight (VMM-268) and a pair of MH-60S Sea Hawks from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Two Five (HSC-25). A more typical aviation component onboard an amphibious assault ship would only have around six F-35Bs, in favor of more MV-22s, as well as a detachment of CH-53E Sea Stallion heavy lift helicopters. This is by no means a hard rule, though, and Wasp-class ships have carried AH-1 gunships and UH-1 light armed utility helicopters at times, as well. It’s also important to mention that we don’t know how many more aircraft were in the ship’s hangar bay when the photos were shot. The Marine aviation force in the Philippines right now reflects the development of high- and low-end force mixtures to respond to a variety of different crises, from a potential major conflict to a humanitarian disaster, that has been ongoing since at least 2012. How to employ the F-35B, which the Marine Corps officially said had reached initial operational capability in 2015 , has been at the core component of crafting these concepts. F-35Bs onboard Wasp ., USN In the past, the Marines have outlined two basic ACE configurations for embarked Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) on Amphibious Ready Groups (ARG) consisting of one Wasp -class amphibious assault ship, one San Antonio -class landing platform dock, and one Whidbey Island -class landing ship dock. One of these has six F-35Bs, 12 MV-22s, and four CH-53Es, while the other has eight F-35Bs, six MV-22s, and four CH-53Es. Typically, the bulk of the ACE would be onboard the Wasp -class ship. The other two vessels would carry additional smaller helicopters, such as AH-1s and UH-1s, as well as unmanned aircraft, such as the RQ-21A Blackjack . A briefing slide showing the ship-by-ship breakdown of the distribution of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit in 2016 across the USS Bataan Amphibious Read Group, which also included the San Antonio -class USS Mesa Verde and the Whidbey Island -class USS Carter Hall . As you can see, the bulk of the ACE, including the fixed wing contingent of seven AV-8B Harrier jump jets, was embarked on Bataan ., USN/USMC In the aforementioned configurations, the expectation is that CH-53Es will eventually give way to the new CH-53K King Stallions . Some number of MH-60s would be part of the full aviation complement in any case, as well. “Both options require congested decks & restrict maintenance footprint,” a chart from the 2017 Marine Aviation Plan noted. This would help explain the apparent absence of CH-53Es entirely onboard Wasp at the moment, as well as the smaller number of MV-22s. A look at existing and future Air Combat Element configurations as of 2017. “AST” refers to amphibious assault, while “FW” is an abbreviation for fixed wing, with the different configurations rated on their ability to perform either general mission set, with red being the most limited and green being the most capable., USMC But amphibious assault ships deploying with 10 F-35Bs could become increasingly normal. In 2017, the Marines said the eventual plan was for ARGs with the aviation-focused USS America , and USS Tripoli, in the lead to be able to carry that many Joint Strike Fighters together with six MV-22s and five CH-53Es. There were also ACE configurations for these ships with only six or eight F-35Bs and more tilt-rotors and helicopters. It’s not clear if this would necessarily work with the third America -class ship, the future USS Bougainville , which is basically in a sub-class of its own. It will feature greater deck space, but will have a well deck, a feature missing on the other two America class ships, reducing the size of its hangar and aviation-related spaces. Still, the Marine Corps doesn’t feel that it will take an America -class amphibious assault ship to carry an aviation force with 10 F-35Bs forever. The Flight II San Antonio -class landing platform docks, previously known as the LX(R) and that will replace the Whidbey Island -class landing ship docks, are set to have improved flight deck capacity. An overview of the changes on the Flight II San Antonios ., Huntington Ingalls Industries When the new Flight II San Antonios arrive, the Marines hope they can shift more tilt-rotors or helicopters to these ships in an each ARG. This, in turn, would free up space on the amphibious assault ships for more F-35Bs. Beyond all this, the mix of at least 10 F-35Bs and four MV-22s on Wasp at present is in some ways a stepping stone toward an even more capable high-end light aircraft carrier concept, known as the “Lightning Carrier,” a reference to the F-35’s official name of Lightning II , which you can read about in more detail in our past feature on the concept linked here . This configuration was based on earlier experience with turning amphibious assault ships into Harrier Carriers with dozens of AV-8B Harrier jump jets. A briefing slide showing the differences in deck layout offered by the USS America (LHA 6) and the future USS Tripoli (LHA 7), versus the future USS Bougainville (LHA 8). , USN A look at how USS America might get configured to serve as Lightning Carrier., USMC An America -class ship setup as a Lightning Carrier might have as many as between 16 and 20 F-35Bs, together with four MV-22s carrying the V-22 aerial refueling system (VARS) acting as dedicated aerial refueling tankers. It would give the amphibious assault ship an impressive amount of firepower for their size, which could allow them to ease the strain on the Navy’s notably overworked supercarriers , especially during smaller conflicts. Separately, the Marines want to develop an advanced unmanned aircraft to serve as an airborne early warning node, which you can read about in more depth here . This could help make it more viable for a Lighting Carrier to conduct independent expeditionary aviation operations, even in higher-risk environments, in the future. An MV-22 employs a prototype of the V-22 Aerial Refueling System (VARS) during a test., Bell To get this critical surveillance and sensor capacity at present, the Marines have to rely on other services and their aircraft, such as the Navy’s carrier-based E-2 Hawkeyes . The F-35’s impressive sensor and electronic warfare suites could also help mitigate the need for this sensor capability, as well as additional jamming support , to begin with. However, this would also require dedicating some number of the jets on board an amphibious assault ship to this role, and keeping one airborne consistently, limiting the overall operational capacity of the force. Lightning carriers could also embed themselves with supercarriers to offer additional capacity during larger operations. The Navy is planning to fly a mix of both stealthy F-35C Joint Strike Fighters and non-stealth F/A-18E/F Super Hornets for the foreseeable future, which means that an amphibious assault ship loaded with F-35Bs could offer an important additional compliment of 5th generation jets to the air wing during a high-end fight. It might not be possible for Wasp -class ships to ever operate as true Lightning Carriers, both because of the physical and maintenance space required and the inability of their decks to handle the increased wear and tear of those kinds of high-tempo aviation operations. But even with 10 F-35Bs, the ships would be able to provide a significant amount of air combat capability. In 2016, during the U.S. air campaign to drive ISIS-affiliated terrorists from the Libyan city of Sirte, the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Bataan conducted a significant amount of the total strikes with just seven AV-8Bs. More recently, during its 2018 cruise to the Horn of Africa and the Middle, the USS Essex , another Wasp -class ship, was ready to send its complement of six F-35Bs to strike in Somalia if need, conducted the first-ever strikes by American F-35s in Afghanistan , and later flew additional sorties against ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The USS Essex sails in the Gulf of Aden in September 2018 with her six F-35Bs. Also visible onboard are 10 MV-22s, four CH-53Es, and an MH-60S., USN In total, Essex ’s Joint Strike Fighters flew more than 100 combat sorties over both Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria across a period of 50 days, according to Task and Purpose . This number could easily have been higher with four extra jets, especially given what we know about the F-35’s readiness rates across the board. With this in mind, having more Joint Strike Fighters could actually be a requisite for generating a meaningful number of sorties during sustained combat operations. It seems to have been no accident that Wasp appeared in the Philippines in this particular high-end configuration, either. “Together they [ Wasp and the F-35s] represent an increase in military capability committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the Navy’s official announcement of the ship’s arrival added. Flight operations aboard Wasp in the South China Sea., USN This statement seems aimed particularly at the Chinese, who have been increasingly assertive in enforcing their broad territorial claims in the South China Sea in recent months. Over the past few years, China has also notably built up a constellation of man-made islands , home now to an array of defenses, including long-range anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, to further cement its claims. In 2016, the Philippines secured an international legal ruling against China’s claims to The Scarborough Shoal, which Manila claims as its territory. The Chinese have rejected this determination and Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte has been included to largely drop the issue, at least publicly , in favor of better ties with Beijing. But it remains a major point of contention between the two parties. A map of Chinese man-made island outposts in the South China Sea that conflict with Filipino territorial claims., DOD In addition, the U.S. government recently reaffirmed that it would defend Filipino forces from any attack in the South China Sea, pointedly including from the Chinese. The United States and the Philippines have had mutual defense treaty in place since 1951 and expanded those ties in 2014. “China’s island-building and military activities in the South China Sea threaten your sovereignty, security, and therefore economic livelihood, as well as that of the United States,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Manila during a visit on Mar. 1, 2019 . “Any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels in the South China Sea will trigger mutual defense obligations.” Wasp , with its load of F-35Bs, is certainly a demonstration of that American commitment. It’s also a very tangible demonstration of the potential value of amphibious assault ships was larger complements of the stealth fighters to project power in higher-risk environments, at least in principle. It remains to be seen if a Wasp -class ship in this configuration can generate enough sorties for the concept to be especially useful. USN Still, Wasp ’s cruise in the Pacific will provide important lessons learned toward the continued development of the Lightning Carrier concept. It could also may point to a future where amphibious assault ships deploying with at least 10 F-35s becomes the norm, especially in the Pacific region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 22, 2021",Skunk Works’ Helendale Radar Signature Test Range Is Where Stealth Dreams Become Reality,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even with the almost surreal size of America’s defense budget, most people would be blown away with how many elaborate installations dot the American landscape that are dedicated to the testing and development of new military technologies and weaponry. These include everything from giant sound-stage like buildings used test missile seekers in action, to lakes where new submarine technologies are run through their paces. They also include a number of outdoor radar cross section measurement facilities, commonly known inside the aerospace and defense world as “RCS test ranges.” From Palm Beach, Florida, to Boardman, Oregon, these ranges are often mistaken for clandestine airstrips or have conspiracy theories related to underground bases or even alien technology slapped on them. But their true role is to carefully evaluate the radar signatures of aircraft designs from different aspects and using different radar bandwidths. Radar signature test sites date back to the dawn of low observable aircraft design , but as the stealth revolution finally got underway in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they became far more technologically advanced than their predecessors. Their very mission necessitates a large open space with a flat linear area positioned in line with various radar emitters. A pole, or a number of poles, often designed of acute angles or of a radar transparent substance like foam, are used to raise aircraft models high above the ground for testing. Obviously security is a major concern at many of these installations, as testing means putting potentially very sensitive aircraft designs and shapes high-up in the air. As such, these facilities are often located in very desolate and/or pre-secured areas, and feature elaborate security measures and clearly marked borders. Lockheed Skunk Works’ Helendale RCS range., Google Earth RCS test facilities also usually feature sliding shelters to hide the test article when not being tested, and large hangar-like buildings for storage, not to mention at least one big array of antennas at the opposite end of facility as the test pylon or pylons. Finally, some do feature underground areas which serve the same function as the moving shelter but in a much more functional manner. Mix all these features together and RCS test facilities can look more like a set from Close Encounter of The Third Kind than a place to where radar measurements are taken on model airplanes. Of all the radar cross section test facilities (aside from the DYCOMS system at Area 51 and the flying NT-43A RAT bird ), one of the most elaborate is Lockheed Martin’s Helendale RCS measurement facility. Conveniently located in the Mojave Desert, just 45 miles east of Lockheed’s Skunk Works headquarters at Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, the installation sits where the old World War II era Helendale Airport once was, on approximately ten square miles of land. In fact, one of the airport’s old runways is still in operation for smaller aircraft, like Lockheed’s company operated PC-12s that ferry personnel to clandestine sites around the American Southwest, and is lit for nighttime operations. But to be clear, that airstrip is anything but public. The first phase of the modern Helendale range facility was built in the early 1980s—just as stealth technology was beginning to boom. By that time the Skunk Works’ F-117 Nighthawk was already operating in a highly classified manner, flying from deep in the Nevada desert out of Tonopah Test Range Airport and Area 51. In 1985 the facility saw a major upgrade, which expanded it from a fairly standard two “pit” setup, with the farthest pit being 5,500 feet from the main antenna array, to a three pit layout that measured some 8,200 feet in length. A massive bunker-like concrete installation at the farthest end made up the third and farthest pit, which included a large retractable pole and an underground staging area for lightly modifying, mounting and dismounting test articles. This subterranean hangar like structure is known as the “upper chamber” and is something of a modern marvel in its own right, with its retractable roof and articulating and very stealthy test pole that can be raised high above the pit and retracted far below, deep beneath the upper chamber. Aerial image of the polecap sitting atop the retractable pylon recessed into the “upper chamber” at Lockheed Helendale RCS range., Otherhand.org At the other end of the facility, by the main array, a series of hangar, support, and control buildings are present, with the large 70 foot tall dish array sitting at the foot of the perfectly flat concrete slab that continues for roughly 7,500 feet until it terminates at the underground pit. The surface is perfectly smooth, with the natural curvature of the earth negated by design. The facilities various main radar arrays are positioned together, with each being are attached to a hydraulic lift that can position them up or down. Other radar arrays can be placed  closer to the poles farther down on the range, and are setup on tracks so that they can be moved in and out of position. Here are some great aerial shots of the facility. According to the website Otherhand.org , which also has some awesome annotated pictures of the installation, the three pits spaced out along the flat surface are described as such: “Moving 1,400′ downrange from the Antenna Array, we come to Antenna Pit 1. At this location, test objects can be placed upon four different mounts. The support may be either a 14′ long metal or composite pylon, a foam column, or an inflated air column. The targets mounted at Pit 1 may be up to 14′ in length and weigh up to 1,600 pounds. The targets here are placed upon the mount using either a crane or forklift. Immediately uprange of Pit 1, visible on the surface of the range, is a long white metal cover. Under this cover is a hinged calibration pylon. Prior to testing a model at Pit 1, the calibration pylon is extended with a known, measured shape mounted on it. The technicians at the operations complex can then adjust and calibrate their equipment on the basis of a known shape. The calibration pylon is then retracted and an actual model measured. Moving next to a point 5,000′ from the antenna array, we come to Pit 2. This 80′ deep pit is covered by hinged white doors on the surface and contains a pylon extended by means of a hydraulic ram. Just beneath these doors, and above the retracted pylon is a small workroom in which models up to 50′ in length and weighing up to 6,000 pounds may be mounted to the pylon. Immediately adjacent and uprange to Pit 2 is a much smaller pit containing a calibration shape mounted on a hinged pylon. It functions in the same manner as the calibration pit for Pit 1. This is pretty much the limit of the first phase of the facility at Helendale. But then in 1985, work began to extend the range and the major bells and whistles were put in. A large 60′ diameter mobile antenna on a crawler-type transporter was added 5,300′ from the main antenna array. When not in use, the transporter moves the large dish antenna laterally, off to the west side of the range. This massive antenna required a specially constructed roadbed and bridge over a flood control channel. The antenna, known as MOBATS, is used for low frequency, high power RF measurements. This mobile crawler antenna seems to be a replacement for an antenna pit planned at the 5,400′ point, but never implemented. At the 7,300′ mark, we come to a very long white metal cover in the surface of the range. Beneath it is another calibration pit (Area 50), the largest of the range at 130′ long. As with the other calibration pylons, a simple methodology is used to raise it. The pylon is merely hinged at one end, and after the cover doors are opened, it is elevated from its horizontal resting position within a well to a near vertical position. Again in this case, its purpose is to place an object of known shape and size into the radar beam to calibrate the receiving equipment prior to actual model testing. The jewel of the facility is found at the 7,500′ point. This curious structure, in the depression at the far end of the range, is known as the “Upper Chamber” (or Area 30 during construction). Although it appears to be built of solid concrete, it is actually composed of concrete blocks. On the side of the structure with the vertical face, there is a large, side-sliding hangar door in the 40′ high face of the structure. It is through this door that models are brought into the Upper Chamber. Careful inspection of the Upper Chamber’s roof reveals what appears to be a square cover, 80′ on a side, with a split along a diagonal. This cover retracts on two sides, separating along the diagonal, exposing an 80′ square opening into the Upper Chamber below. When closed, an air bag arrangement seals the diagonal seam. Surprisingly, the useable area within the Upper Chamber is less than it appears when viewed from outside. Actual level floor space is only about 130′ by 110′, about 14,000 square feet. Most of the area apparently covered in concrete surrounding the Upper Chamber is actually covered slope. At the time of construction this area was not utilized and left as covered, but bare slope.” A test article on the pole being moved into exposed position., Youtube Screencap The site goes on to describe the interior of the upper chamber space: “The area within the Upper Chamber is primarily a workroom and staging area. There is a large overhead traveling bridge hoist for the movement and manipulation of RCS models. There is also a diesel generator, a control room, restrooms and a small winch room off to one end. There are no office areas. The right rear portion of the Upper Chamber is dominated by the Silo and its cover. The Silo, also known as Area 35, is located directly beneath the floor of the Upper Chamber and takes up much of the usable floor space. It is a massive circular shaft with an inside diameter of 33′, reaching a depth of 210′ below the floor of the Upper Chamber. It is constructed of reinforced concrete with a minimum wall thickness of 3-1/2′. The upper walls of the Silo are a bit thicker. Construction of the Silo structure alone required in excess of 3,000 cubic yards of concrete to construct. That’s the contents of about 300 fully loaded cement trucks, hence the local residents’ tales of “cement trucks lined up for miles” during the facility’s construction. The depth of the Silo puts it well below the water table of the adjacent Mojave River, and ensuring seepage water is constantly pumped out is a concern. There are some stories that the design of the Silo was based upon that of an underground Titan missile silo. If true, there was undoubtedly intense interest in the site from Soviet spy satellites during construction! Residing within the Silo is the retractable pylon upon which models are placed for raising into the radar beams for measurement. The pylon rests upon a counterbalanced hoist structure just beneath it, which is raised by a dual cable winch mechanism. In addition to a ladder, access is provided to various levels of the Silo by means of a small, Swedish made personnel elevator. For testing, models (or even full sized aircraft) are brought into the Upper Chamber through the side sliding doors, raised by the bridge hoist, and placed over the tip of the pylon. After any necessary calibration, the roof of the Upper Chamber is opened and the pylon begins to rise. The pylon, which was upgraded in May, 1996 with a new, stealthier design (called a “Squareback Superskirt” by Lockheed), has the capability to move the model fore and aft 7′ or rotate it 360 degrees, to help clear the opening in the roof of the Upper Chamber. The movement capabilities of the pylon are also used in the testing program. When the pylon reaches full extension, hydraulic cylinders tilt the pylon forward to an angle of 55 degrees from horizontal and the roof may close beneath it. When fully raised in its normal tilted position, it can place a model or actual aircraft (weighing up to 30,000 pounds with dimensions up to 105′ by 73′) about 100′ above the roof of the Upper Chamber. The silvery stretched pumpkin seed shape on the end of the main pylon, (and the shape on the pylon at Pit 2), is a “polecap”. The “Star”, a company newspaper published by the Lockheed Martin Skunkworks, in the June 21, 1996 issue, ran a photo of the new pylon and polecap on its front page (shown below). The polecap is used during calibration of the main pylon. The shape of the pylon is so stealthy, that only the very tip of the pylon ends up being a significant source of signal return. To minimize this, a precisely shaped polecap is placed on the tip of the pylon to eliminate any radar returns from this spot. Then, once the very small return from the pylon is accurately determined and the system calibrated, the polecap is removed and a model put in its place.  Perhaps surprisingly, the polecap was fabricated for Lockheed by a boat-building firm, Goetz Boats in Bristol, Rhode Island.  It consists of aluminum honeycomb and carbon fiber, and the band along the outside edge is made of Kevlar, and the whole thing coated with RAM.  After fabrication, it was shipped across country on a flatbed truck, looking to the world like the hull of a racing yacht.” RQ-3 Dark Star and F-22 being tested at Helendale. , Lockheed So a ton of engineering went into what appears as a fairly sparse but peculiar facility from a distance, and from above. The Pentagon contracted their own iteration of the design around the same time as Helendale was receiving its upgrades in 1985. Known as the Radar Advanced Measurements (RAM) and Radar Target Scatter (RASCAT) facility, it’s part of the National Radar Cross Section Test Facility (NRCSTF). The remote installation is located near Holloman AFB, among the White Sands Missile Range. It is the most advanced RCS range in the government’s portfolio and features a very similar underground staging facility as the one built at Helendale. The main NRCSTF, located roughly 35 miles from the RAS/RASCAT facility, is where Northrop and Lockheed had their “pole off” during the XST competition , which ended in Lockheed winning the contract that would eventually give birth to Have Blue and the F-117 Nighthawk. During this early test of stealth design, the radar operator thought Lockheed’s “Hopeless Diamond” model fell off the pole until a bird landed on it and a return suddenly showed up on his scope. Northrop’s XST stealth tactical aircraft contender on the pole during the competition which saw it face off against Lockheed’s “Hopeless Diamond” design., Public Domain You can get an unprecedented look side Lockheed’s Helendale RCS range in this video, which includes some very interesting comments from one of the top engineers that runs the site on what has been tested there, and what is possibly flying today under the cloak of deep classification: With the big changes that have come to rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing, one would have to imagine that building new models and shapes to test at RCS ranges like Helendale has become a faster, cheaper affair for major aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin. It is known that the Skunk Works in particular has taken a very aggressive approach to these capabilities, along with efficiently building large composite structures , dating back to the early 2000s . And considering how potential enemies’ radar and integrated air defense system technology is rapidly evolving, being able to better validate and tune new designs to be as stealthy as possible has become more important than ever. Whereas stealth aircraft like the F-117 , and even the F-35 to a large degree, are optimized for low observability in certain radar bands and from certain aspects, next generation stealth aircraft designs, l ike the B-21 Raider , will feature broadband low observability , which aims to counter a wide number of frequency bands from all aspects. Even morphing aircraft structures will work to reduce an aircraft’s detectability by radar in the future. As such, testers at Helendale and other RCS facilities will be more challenged than ever to provide the critical data needed to keep stealth a relevant technology in the coming decades and to validate much more dynamic aircraft designs against multiple radar bandwidths. But regardless of its capabilities or its critical mission, when it comes to just visuals alone, there are few facilities in the world that look as Hollywood ready as the Helendale RCS range.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 25, 2019",Taiwan Will “Forcibly Expel” Chinese Planes After Recent Taiwan Strait Boundary Violation,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing Wen has said her country’s air force will conduct a “forceful expulsion” of any Chinese military aircraft that cross the so-called “Median Line” in the Taiwan Strait, which serves as de facto boundary between it and the People’s Republic of China. This comes a day after two Chinese J-11 fighter jets violated the line, prompting Taiwanese jets to scramble in response and eliciting a particularly condemnation from Taipei. This initial incident also followed reports that the United States was preparing to sell advanced F-16 Viper fighter jets to Taiwan, where Beijing has long said it draws a “red line,” and a significant increase in American naval patrols through the Taiwan Strait . Tsai’s announcement first appeared in a post on her official Facebook page on April 1, 2019. The day before, the pair of Chinese J-11 fighter jets had crossed the median line and remained there for approximately 10 minutes, before returning to the other side. Chinese violations of the Median Line are not uncommon, but in the past, the aircraft have typically withdrawn quickly . Though Taiwan sent unspecified fighter jets out to meet the J-11s, it’s unclear whether the two actually came within visual distance of each other. This follows months of increasingly aggressive Chinese aerial activity around Taiwan, which is clearly meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) in any future cross-strait skirmish. In May 2018, PLAAF fighter jets and H-6 bombers had notably flown a route that effectively encircled the island, showing its ability to attack from virtually any direction , something that had not necessarily been the case in the past. Beijing “should stop behavior of this sort, which endangers regional peace, and not be an international troublemaker,” Huang Chung Yen, a spokesperson for the Taiwanese president, had said after the boundary line incursion on Mar. 31, 2019, according to Reuters . President Tsai had ordered the country’s military “to complete all tasks on war preparation,” he added. Taiwanese F-16s., Republic of China Air Force It’s not entirely clear from Tsai’s statement exactly what measures the Taiwanese Air Force will take in the future to eject Chinese aircraft that cross the Median Line. It certainly means that its combat jets will intercept any incoming planes and demand that they leave immediately, but what amount of “force” Taiwan’s pilots might use to ensure compliance with those instructions remains to be seen. The danger, especially with not knowing the exact extent of Taiwan’s new policy, is that miscommunication or miscalculation in a future incident might quickly lead to a larger cross-strait skirmish. Regardless, Tsai’s statement is a significant escalation in rhetoric and it’s hard to see how it won’t elicit a fiery response from the government in Beijing. So far, however, China’s Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry had declined to comment on the breach of the Median Line and the response from Tsai and other Taiwanese authorities. Tsai’s new threat to respond more forcefully to future Median Line violations also reflects a recent spike in tensions between the two parties, as well as between China and the United States, the latter being Taiwan’s principle international ally. After establishing diplomatic ties with China in 1979, the U.S. government broke off technical relations with authorities in Taiwan, but continues to work with officials there through other channels . The United States also reserves the right to sell weapons and other military hardware, ostensibly to bolster the Taiwanese military’s ability to defend against a Chinese intervention. However, in the past, the U.S. government has often shied away from selling Taiwan more advanced military systems that might draw particular ire from Beijing. The sale of new, or even upgraded , F-16 fighter jets to help improve the capability of the increasingly geriatric Taiwanese air force has been a particular saga, which you can read about more here . This attitude has undergone a noticeable change under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which has developed stronger ties with Tsai’s government. A Taiwanese Air Force F-16B. Taiwan is now in the process of upgrading its F-16A/B jets to the newer F-16V standard ., AP In March 2019, reports emerged that U.S. President Donald Trump’s Administration was preparing to approve the sale of dozens of new Block 70 F-16s, one of the latest and most advanced configurations of the jet that Lockheed Martin offers. Taiwan’s acquisition of these more capable fighter jets has long been a “red line” for China and this reported deal may have been part of what prompted the PLAAF to send its J-11s across the Median Line, at least in part, in the first place. The incursion also came just days after the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur and the U.S. Coast Guard’s Legend -class cutter USCGC Bertholf sailed through the Taiwan Strait on a so-called Freedom of Navigation patrol, or FONOP. This was the sixth such patrol in nine months , which reflects a major uptick in FONOPs through this region under Trump. There have also been reports that the Trump administration is considering sending an aircraft carrier through the Strait, which would only further heighten regional tensions. In January 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) released a China Military Power report that concluded Beijing’s desire to eventually coerce Taiwan to reunify with the mainland was the “primary driver” of the country’s efforts to expand and modernize its military capabilities . This same report also specifically cited then-U.S. President Bill Clinton’s decision to send two carrier strike groups through the Taiwan Strait in 1996, a massive show of force in response to a major regional crisis at the time, as a key incident that kicked off Beijing’s efforts to rapidly increase the size and capabilities of its forces. The People’s Liberation Army has been notably focused on developing means to counter American aircraft carriers in any future crisis. A grainy shot of the first-in-class USS Nimitz , at left, and the Forrestal -class USS Independence sailing together near Japan in 1997. These two carriers had sailed through the Taiwan Strait the year before., USN The present escalating war of words between China and Taiwan and China and the United States certainly points to a risk of another crisis similar to the one in 1996. In that instance, the inciting incident was the U.S. government’s decision to allow then-President Lee Teng Hui to speak at Cornell University, his alma mater, on “Taiwanese Democratization.” Authorities Beijing had branded Lee as an independence-minded “traitor.” The current Chinese government under President Xi Jinping has similarly labeled Tsai an “ independence extremist ” and China’s premier has not shied away from threatening to use force to prevent the island from formally breaking away and declaring itself an independent country. “The country is growing strong, the nation is rejuvenating and unification between the two sides of the strait is the great trend of history,” Xi said in a New Year’s address aimed square at Taiwan that he gave before a gathering in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Jan. 2, 2019 . “We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures.” Chinese President Xi Xinping gives his address on Jan. 2, 2019., AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein In 1996, China had responded to Lee’s talk in the United States with a series of snap military drills, including firing DF-15 short-range ballistic missiles near the Taiwanese-controlled Pengjia islet . This, in turn, led to the U.S. Navy show of force involving the two carriers. It’s not clear how a similar series of altercations might go today, and whether sailing carrier groups into the region might be enough now to defuse the situation, especially given China’s increasingly assertive stance elsewhere. Just in January 2019, Chinese forces performed a missile drill involving its relatively new DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles that seemed aimed at threatening the prospect of long-range strikes on American forces in the South China Sea. In October 2018, there had also been a very dangerous encounter between People’s Liberation Army Navy and U.S. Navy warships in that hotly contested region. The video below shows Chinese personnel conducting a snap drill involving the DF-26 IRBM in January 2019. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdm2i-jVAWk China seems disinclined to back down with regards to Taiwan, either, at least in the near term. As DIA’s China Military Power report noted, the entire reason for the country’s military buildup and its increasingly aggressive military activities has been to challenge America’s ability to operate at all in areas, especially Taiwan, which Beijing sees as part of its own national territory. Whether or not Taiwanese President Tsai is as much of an “extremist” as the Chinese government paints her as, her very public defiance of China’s authority is exactly the kind of thing Beijing would feel unable to allow to continue unchallenged. Beyond Taiwan, China has other potential breakaway provinces to worry about and fears that Taiwanese independence could have a cascading impact on its territorial integrity. Chinese authorities may feel under the gun to act, as well, given that U.S. and Taiwanese officials have already publicly scheduled meetings in September 2019 to discuss additional ways to push back against China’s reunification efforts. Beijing has, not surprisingly, decried this move as destabilizing interference in its affairs. On top of all this, the United States and China remained locked in a protracted and bitter trade war that has itself escalated into a worrisome series of tit-for-tat arrests of prominent business leaders and other individuals. Regardless, Taiwan’s government has taken a very hard line and has drawn its own immediate red line over any further incursions across the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait. This is a stance China will almost certainly challenge in the near future and that risks further pushing to two sides towards a new cross-strait crisis, one that could also draw in the United States.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Helicopters are amazing machines that we usually associate with vertical takeoffs and landings, but under some conditions, and especially with certain helicopters, vertical takeoffs and landings just aren’t in the cards. Russia’s Mi-8/17/24/35 family of helicopters, which includes the utility-oriented “Hip” and the attack-focused “Hind,” often use running takeoffs and landings to their advantage. The video below, that shows a Polish Mi-24 Hind taking off in Afghanistan, is an extreme example of this. The clip shows the Mi-24 kick-up its tail and balance on its nosewheel as it roars down the runway, transitioning to a climb right before the runway ends. It is an impressive video that makes the Hind look even more menacing than it already does—like a cobra about to strike. Here is a direct link to the video in case it doesn’t automatically show up below. The maneuver is usually used for hot and high operating environments and/or when the helicopter is heavily laden. In the case of the Polish Hind’s departure, I think there may also have been a bit of showmanship involved. Here’s a similar running takeoff made by a Polish Hind in Afghanistan that is a little less “Hollywood”: Another good example of the technique, albeit less extreme, is this video of an Indian Air Force Mi-17 taking off from one of the world’s most notorious airports— Lukla Airport in Nepal , elevation 9,334 feet. You can read a bit more about running takeoffs here and running landings here . Poland’s Hind and Hip community does like to show off the awesome stuff they do. Check out this sweet highlight reel from Afghanistan that also features some pretty awesome running takeoffs and landings: Even as Poland looks to bring more modern helicopters into its aerospace ecosystem , the country’s military plans on keeping roughly 30 Mi-24s in service, most of which are approaching 30 years old. An upgrade program is planned that will see them remain relevant and serviceable through the 2020s and probably beyond. So this probably won’t be the last time you will see a Polish Hind zooming off the runway with its nose buried and its tail high in the air!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 15, 2019",Armada Of B-52s And F-16 Escorts Just Flew Off Norway Resulting In These Gorgeous Photos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has released some gorgeous shots of B-52Hs flying with Norwegian F-16 Viper fighter jets over the Norwegian Sea, including uncommon shots of five of the bombers flying together above the clouds. The lumbering aircraft have been flying training missions across Europe from RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom for more than two weeks as part of a regional deployment. The flight over the Norwegian Sea occurred on Mar. 28, 2019 and involved five B-52Hs together with a pair of Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16AMs and a lone two-seat F-16BM. The Bomber Task Force consisting of six B-52Hs, also commonly called BUFFs, for Big Ugly Fat Fellows, first arrived at RAF Fairford on Mar. 14, 2019. All of the bombers are from the 2nd Bomb Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The flights with the Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16AM/BMs gave the bomber crews an opportunity to familiarize themselves with operating in that part of the world and “to demonstrate U.S. commitment to allies and partners through the global employment of our military forces,” according to an official Air Force statement . One of the five B-52Hs flies alongside the pair of Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16AMs and lone F-16BM on Mar. 28, 2019., USAF USAF USAF USAF “Training with joint partners, allied nations, and other U.S. Air Force units contributes to our ready and postured forces and enables us to build enduring and strategic relationships necessary to confront a broad range of global challenges,” the service had said when the bombers first touched down in the United Kingdom. So far, the B-52s have flown missions with a number of NATO members in and around the Norwegian Sea, the North Atlantic Ocean near Iceland, the Baltic region, and even in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Greece. The Air Force has said some of these missions, such as the ones off Iceland, have included mock strikes on surface targets. USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF USAF The deployment is clearly meant to be a signal of the U.S. military’s strategic capabilities to American’s “great power” competitors, primarily Russia. Though the Air Force has regularly sent small detachments of B-52s to the United Kingdom for training exercises throughout Europe over the years, having six of the bombers there at once is the single largest deployment of the BUFFs to the region since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to Military.com . During the opening phases of that conflict, 20 B-52s flew strike missions from the United Kingdom. B-52s taxiing together at RAF Fairford. Note the new color multi-function display., USAF Sending the bombers to RAF Fairford is just the latest in a string of increasing U.S. military activity that seems pointed straight at the Russians and reassuring NATO members in the face of the Kremlin’s threatening stance toward the alliance. Most notably, in October 2018, the North Atlantic bloc held its largest multi-national exercise in decades, Trident Juncture , which also took place in and around Norway. As part of those drills, the U.S. Navy sailed a carrier strike group above the Arctic Circle for the first time in nearly 30 years. The Kremlin has been decried the bomber deployment and was particularly sensitive about the B-52s flying over the Baltic Sea near its the Kaliningrad enclave . Kaliningrad is geographically separated from the rest of Russia and contains a number of key Russian military installations, including a warm water port that serves as the home of the country’s Baltic Fleet. “On March 15, 2019, a US Air Force B-52 aircraft with the transponder switched on performed a flight over international waters of the Baltic Sea parallel to Russia’s territorial waters,” the Russian Ministry of Defense said in on Mar. 16, 2019 . “The plane did not approach Russia’s border closer than 150 kilometers [93 miles] and turned around immediately after Russian air defense systems on combat duty tracked it.” The clear implication was that the bombers were practicing for mock attack runs on the enclave, akin to the accusations Norway has leveled at Russia over apparent simulated strikes on a secretive radar installation near the town of Vardø. But while the Norwegian government has provided evidence of the Kremlin’s activities, there is no clear indication that the B-52s conducted any overly aggressive maneuvering in the Baltic. At its widest, the distance between Kaliningrad and the Swedish coast on the other side of the Baltic is less than 200 miles. To say that the bombers were flying 100 miles away could easily put them closer to Sweden than to Russian territory and it would be hard to otherwise fly through the area in international airspace without coming this close to the enclave. Whatever happened on Mar. 15, 2019, didn’t deter the Americans from returning a week later, when the Air Force said the B-52s operated continuously in the Baltic for a 24-hour period . During that particular training mission, Russia sent Su-27 Flanker fighter jets to shadow some of the B-52s for a period of time. https://youtube.com/watch?v=1SAjcbNQDJs However, these intercepts have been much less notable than when another Flanker conducted an epic photo bomb over the Baltic in 2017. In that instance, the Russian jet snuck into formation with a large number of aircraft, including a B-52 and a B-1B bomber, that NATO had assembled as part of a media photo op. At the time, the Air Force had B-52s, B-1B Bones , and B-2 Spirits deployed to Europe, the first time all three had been in the region since 2009. Not to be outdone by these latest U.S. bomber exercises, on Mar. 29, 2019 , the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that two Tu-160 Blackjack bombers had conducted a 13 hour-long patrol in the Barents Sea near Norway and the North Sea near the United Kingdom. In the latter case, the bomber’s presence prompted the U.K. Royal Air Force to scramble jets to intercept and monitor the bombers. The Air Force has not said how much longer the B-52s will remain deployed in Europe, but hopefully we’ll get even more impressive shots of the bomber task force at work in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 9, 2019",U.S. Navy Turned A British Amphibious Ship Into A Mine-Clearing Sea Base Packed With Drone Tech,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy and the U.K. Royal Navy recently conducted an experiment involving deploying a specialized minesweeping task force, which included unmanned surface and undersea vehicles, onboard a British amphibious ship . The idea of using “vessels of opportunity” to host counter-mine forces is an important component of the U.S. Navy’s plan for reaching a fleet size of 355 ships in the next 15 years. This test also demonstrates how the concept could leverage non-combat and allied vessels for these missions in the future. The Navy’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Two (EODMU 2) led the American group of almost 120 personnel on board the Royal Fleet Auxiliary’s landing ship dock RFA Mounts Bay . The experiment, which occurred in the Caribbean Sea, ran from Mar. 18 through Mar. 24, 2019. Mounts Bay is in the midst of a three-year forward deployment in the region, where it is available to support humanitarian and disaster relief missions, counter-narcotics operations , and otherwise engage with the United Kingdom’s regional partners, including the United States. “To embark all of those players onto one platform, an allied platform nonetheless, to integrate them all from a central hub, and to deconflict them from one task group is what we were looking to accomplish,” U.S. Navy Commander Jon Haase, head of EODMU 2, said afterward . “This was an opportunity to exercise command and control of a mine countermeasures task group so we could refine and advance both our ability to command and control but also our understanding of how the systems would work together off a vessel not designed for them.” RFA Mounts Bay sails in the Caribbean with elements of the US Navy mine countermeasures task force visible on the deck., USN The mine countermeasures task group main contingent was from EODMU 2, who train to clear mines, improvised explosive devices, and similar threats at sea and on land. It also included an MH-60S Sea Hawk helicopter from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron Two Eight (HSC-28) and personnel from Littoral Combat Ship Squadron Two (LCSRON 2) to support the employment of a Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle (CUSV) and multiple Knifefish unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV). The MH-60S was based ashore during the experiment, but did fly missions from the Mounts Bay . During the test, the helicopter employed both the AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) and the AN/ASQ-235 Airborne Mine Neutralization System – Archerfish (AMNS-AF). Northrop Grumman’s ALMDS uses a laser imaging system to generate imagery that highlights potential objects of interest, such as mines, both on the surface and just below the waves. The full system can then classify and geo-locate those threats for other systems can neutralize them. The MH-60S itself can carry one such system to defeat those mines, the AMNS-AF, which Raytheon and BAE Systems have collaborated on to deliver to the U.S. Navy. The Archerfish system involves a cradle that the helicopter carries with four expendable interceptors. After the helicopter releases an Archerfish, it remains tethered to the helicopter, providing a fiber optic data link to an operator on board. That individual then manually steers it to the target using a camera feed from the interceptor, which also contains an armor-piercing explosive charge to destroy the threat. The video below shows a test of Archerfish launched from an unmanned undersea vehicle, which could be another combination the U.S. Navy might be interested in acquiring in the future. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IY1SbZdCD04 The Knifefish Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs), which carry a synthetic aperture sonar, are another means of detecting mines, especially those that might be submerged at depths beyond where airborne systems such as the ALMDS can scan, or that are buried or partially buried on the seafloor. The underwater drone also has the ability to classify and locate items of interest for further investigation or neutralization. The last major system in this recent test, Textron’s CUSV , is part of a still-under-development unmanned minesweeping system known as the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS). The UISS will consist of the drone boat pulling a mine-clearing system that triggers acoustic and magnetic naval mines, or mines that use a combination of those features. The Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle (CUSV)., Joseph Trevithick Embarked EODMU 2 personnel also had the ability to manually inspect possible mines and other hazards above and below the waves if necessarily. Mounts Bay is an ideal platform to support this mix of systems, given that the ship, which displaces around 16,000 tons, has a relatively large flight deck for helicopters, a well deck to launch larger boats, and the ability to launch smaller watercraft from bays on its sides. Able to carry more than 350 troops and their equipment on more traditional amphibious missions, it has ample space to house the various drone control and other necessary facilities to host the mine-clearing force. Earlier in 2019, Mounts Bay used this capacity to hosted a U.S. Coast Guard force, including a law enforcement detachment and an MH-65 helicopter from the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron, or HITRON , to conduct combined counter-drug missions in the Caribbean. https://youtube.com/watch?v=KxR1FGFdYoA In general, the concept of using Mounts Bay as a minesweeping platform in many ways reflects what is now years of continuous Navy experience. For nearly a decade straight now, the service has been using amphibious ships, and now dedicated sea bases, as floating platforms to support countermine operations. This began with the overhaul of the USS Ponce in 2011, which you can read about in more detail here , and has since evolved into a small fleet of purpose-built Expeditionary Sea Base vessels. The full package the U.S. Navy embarked on the ship also combined the bulk of the systems the service had developed for the mine countermeasures mission module for the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). The service originally planned for ships in both LCS classes to be able to rapidly swap out these different mission modules to fill different roles as necessary, but has steadily moved away from this concept. It now expects to designate eight LCS ships as permanent platforms for the minesweeping systems. An overview of the different planned mission modules for the Littoral Combat Ships, including the mine countermeasures package., USN The problem is that the this is not a one-for-one replacement for the 11 remaining Avenger -class minesweepers the Navy has in service now and is looking to have retired 2023. As such, the specially-equipped LCSs are unlikely to support the demand for mine countermeasures support in the future. The threat of naval mines is only increasing in general and the Navy knows it will need more mine-sweeping support in the future, not less, especially during any major conflict across the wide expanses of the Pacific Region. But it is also looking to avoid having to purchase new minesweepers at the cost of other shipbuilding priorities over the next 30 years. The Avenger-class minesweeper USS Scout neutralizes a threat during a training exercise., USN That’s where the “vessel of opportunity” concept comes in. The ability to readily embark a mine countermeasures force package on any available ship could help ease the strain on the service’s shrinking number of dedicated minesweeping ships and increase the flexibility of those assets. Utilizing non-combat ships, such as Military Sealift Command ’s sealift fleet, whenever possible could also help free up combat vessels for their primary missions. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have been increasingly exploring how MSC’s fleets might be able to support new and emerging roles . It’s also worth noting that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary serves a largely non-combatant role, similar to MSC, in support of the Royal Navy. Beyond that, leveraging any allied platforms, such as the Mounts Bay , could further expand the options available to the Navy, particularly on short notice. This would also help ensure the service has the ability to rapidly deploy counter-mine forces even if it has no vessels of opportunity of its own nearby. With the increasing proliferation of naval mines, including among non-state actors, such as Houthi rebels in Yemen , these threats could rapidly emerge with little advance warning. Beyond the obvious threat to American warships during more traditional combat operations, the sudden appearance of minefields in major shipping lanes could quickly have major geopolitical and economic impacts. https://youtube.com/watch?v=af9BnV1QrEE A prime example is the Strait of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and then on the Arabian Sea. Iran routinely threatens to blockage this passage, through which 20 percent of all the world’s oil exports flow and that serves as a transit route for 90 percent of all of the region’s energy exports, including natural gas. It still remains to be seen whether the vessels of opportunity concept will be as workable as the Navy hopes. While the plan might help avoid the need to have dedicated ships available, it will still require the service to have the mine-clearing force packages ready to go onto an available vessel on short notice. Each of its fleets around the world does have these elements organically, but that doesn’t ensure they’ll be close to the vessel of opportunity when the time comes or that there will be enough of them to meet demand at current force levels. Pre-positioning sufficient assets to support the plan could be costly and resource intensive in its own way, especially given the Navy’s persistent personnel shortages . Minesweeping is also a complex, time-consuming, and risky mission that demands both significant training and benefits greatly from expertise. The systems involved, such as the mine countermeasures equipment for the MH-60S and unmanned surface and undersea vessels, also require specialized support, as was clear from this latest experiment. HSC-28’s MH-60S aboard RFA Mounts Bay during the experiment in March 2019., USN These issues already called into question just how effective an LCS equipped with the mine countermeasures module might be unless its crew received more intensive training in the mission to go along with it. Mine-clearing task forces may similarly have trouble rapidly integrating with just any ship on a moment’s notice. If a lengthy workup is necessary to get everyone on the same page before a vessel of opportunity can set sail for a minesweeping mission, the entire idea may prove to be far less flexible than the Navy might hope. The Navy is also looking toward developing additional minesweeping tools that could help provide added counter-mine capacity and mitigate some of the issues with the vessels of opportunity concept. These efforts notably include high-endurance, autonomous unmanned surface and undersea vehicles that can operate across a larger area than something such as the CUSV and do so with more limited support from manned vessels. These are all issues the Navy will have to consider going forward in order to validate the concept and ensure it succeeds. It seems safe to assume that we will be seeing more experiments, like the recent one with Mounts Bay , in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 7, 2018",The USAF’s Plan To Move F-22 Training Could Make Langley Air Force Base Raptor Central,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has formally proposed moving its main F-22 stealth fighter training unit to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, which could put more than a third of the total Raptor force at just one base . The announcement comes as the service warns that it needs additional funds to keep repairs going at Tyndall Air Force base in Florida, still officially the F-22 training hub , which suffered devastating damage from Hurricane Michael last year. The Air Force formally designated Langley, technically part of Joint Base Langley-Eustis, as its preferred future home of the F-22 Formal Training Unit (FTU) on Mar. 25, 2019, but only publicly announced this decision two days later. The 43rd Fighter Squadron had served as the FTU at Tyndall until Hurricane Michael decimated that base in October 2018, forcing it to move to nearby Eglin Air Force Base, which is also in Florida. Tyndall’s 95th Fighter Squadron, an operational unit, had sent its Raptors to various other bases across the country, including Langley. “The permanent solution must address readiness and pilot production by ensuring the F-22 FTU is set up at a location that optimizes readiness and supports the secretary of defense’s requirement to improve mission capable rates to 80 percent,” U.S. Air Force spokesman Robert Leese said in a statement on Mar. 27, 2019 . The service still has to conduct environmental impact analyses and other studies to demonstrate that Langley can support the mission and what improvements might be necessary to ensure that it can. This is a process that can last multiple years. F-22s assigned to Langley Air Force Base take part in a total force exercise, or “ Elephant Walk ,” in February 2019., USAF Re-establishing the FTU at Langley – which may or may not continue to be known as the 43rd Fighter Squadron – involves more than just moving the F-22s. At Tyndall , prior to Hurricane Michael, the 372nd Training Squadron, Detachment 4 supported the 43rd’s operations. The 2nd Fighter Squadron had also provided dedicated adversary support with its T-38 Talons . Both of those units followed the 43rd to Eglin after the storm. Tyndall is also home to the physical F-22 schoolhouse facilities, including simulator facilities. The Air Force will need to move all of that to Langley to support the activities of the FTU. Langley does already host two squadrons of Raptors assigned to the 1st Fighter Wing, the 27th and 94th Fighter Squadrons, but it could still require additional supporting facilities and maintenance capacity, to host the added F-22s and T-38s. Among other things, the stealth fighters’ need climate-controlled hangars to support the maintenance required for their specialized radar-absorbing coatings . The first two F-22s returned to Tyndall on Mar. 1, 2019 – specifically for routine maintenance . Two F-22s sit on the ramp on Mar. 1, 2019, at Tyndall, the first Raptors at the base since the Air Force evacuated the last of the jets from the decimated base in November 2018., USAF As of 2018, the 1st Fighter Wing had 46 of the stealth fighters, while the 43rd Fighter Squadron had another 31, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). With less than 185 Raptors still in service, the move would not only make Langley the new F-22 training hub, but the single largest Raptor base in the country. The distribution of the AIr Force’s entire F-22 fleet, as of 2018., GAO This would certainly restore some of Langley’s past glory, too. Presently home to just two F-22 squadrons, it had been a major fighter base during the Cold War. The 1st Fighter Wing was the first operational unit to get the then-new F-15 Eagle in the 1970s, operating four squadrons of those jets at its peak. It was also the first operational Wing to get F-22s. The last F-15s left the Wing in 2010, leaving it both smaller and a purely F-22 unit. In 2015, a squadron of T-38s arrived to provide dedicated adversary support at the base. The Air Force’s decision is also in line with recommendations from GAO in 2018 to consolidate more F-22s at fewer locations to improve readiness and reduce operational and maintenance costs. It could also help the service at least work toward meeting former Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ demand that the mission capable rates for the Raptors hit 80 percent by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year, as spokesperson Leese noted. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has reaffirmed this requirement. The first operational F-22 flies past Fort Monroe in Virginia on its way to Langley Air Force Base in 2005., USAF The mission capable rates for the F-22s are notoriously low , something The War Zone has explored in depth, generally hovering somewhere below 50 percent overall. Earlier in March 2019 , outgoing Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson told members of Congress that the Raptor fleet was unlikely to meet the 80 percent goal by the end of the year, due in large part to the Tyndall disaster. Hurricane Michael struck after Mattis had issued his initial memorandum about improving fighter jet readiness. But beyond needing to complete environmental and other studies to assess Langley’s readiness before it can proceed with the move, the Air Force will also have to convince Congress to provide the necessary funding. Legislators from Virginia had been actively advocating for the move since at least February 2019 , but their colleagues from Florida could oppose the decision. Before Hurricane Michael , Tyndall had provided for around 20,000 jobs in the associated community and generated millions annually for the local economy. Air Force personnel stand on top of a retired “Gate Guard” F-15 that sustained significant damage during Hurricane Michael., USAF With an eye toward the potential backlash to anything that might look like a proposal to close Tyndall or otherwise shrink its operations, the Air Force has already pitched a plan to turn the Florida base into a home for as many as three squadrons of stealthy F-35A Joint Strike Fighters in the future. The Air Force has serious incentives to continue other activities at Tyndall, as well. The base is home to QF-16 target drones and contractor-operated Mu-2  training aircraft and supports training on ranges off the coast of Florida. Maintaining these elements and providing space for visiting units to train have already made rehabilitating the base, at least to a certain degree, an imperative for the Air Force. But turning it into an F-35 base could also take years to come to fruition. At the same time, any suggestion of trying to keep F-22 training activities at Tyndall may not even be a realistic option in the near term. Though Tyndall officially resumed flying operations months ago , the Air Force says it will take at least $3 billion over the next three year or so to complete all of the planned repairs to the base to truly return it to its previous operating capacity. In February 2019, the service warned that could all come grinding to a halt on May 1 unless Congress approves additional funding. Legislators are looking at additional requests to support repairs at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, which just got inundated by serious flooding , too. There is also a growing dispute on Capitol Hill over military construction budgets in general due to President Donald Trump’s administration’s controversial plans to use some of that funding to build various barriers along the U.S. border with Mexico. How all of this might impact Tyndall’s future remains to be seen, but Langley’s could be very bright.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",The Air Force Has Grounded Its B-1B Bomber Fleet For The Second Time In A Year,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has ground its B-1B Bone bomber fleet for the second time in less than a year over problems with the aircraft’s emergency egress system . This is this time has to do with how the drogue parachutes that stabilize the plane’s ejection seats if the crew has to punch out. Air Force Global Strike Command, which oversees all of the service’s bombers, including the B-1Bs, ordered the “safety stand-down” on Mar. 28, 2019 , after uncovering the issue in at least one bomber assigned to an unspecified unit. There is no indication as yet as to how many Bones actually have a problem or how long it be before the fleet get flying again. This is the full statement from the command on the grounding order: The Air Force Global Strike Command commander ordered a safety stand-down of the B-1B Lancer fleet March 28. During a routine inspection of the B-1B drogue chute system, potentially fleet-wide issues were identified with the rigging of the drogue chute. It appears to be a procedural issue and is unrelated to the previous problem with egress system components.  As a precautionary measure, the commander directed a holistic inspection of the entire egress system. The safety stand-down will afford maintenance and Aircrew Flight Equipment technicians the necessary time to thoroughly inspect each aircraft. As these inspections are completed and any issues are resolved, aircraft will return to flight. The safety of Airmen is the command’s top priority and this precautionary step will enable the command to correct any potential issues. The emergency egress system in the B-1B involves both the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) II ejection seats for the crew on board, as well as hatches in the upper fuselage that blow open before the seats send those individuals rocketing out of the aircraft. The drogue chutes help orient the seats after the initially leave the aircraft to prevent dangerous movements that could cause serious injuries or prevent the main parachutes from deploying properly. The Air Force’s A-10 Warthog , B-2 Spirit , F-15C/D Eagle , F-15E Strike Eagle , F-16 Viper , and F-22 Raptor aircraft all also use the United Technologies Corporation (UTC) seat. We don’t know if the procedure for rigging the drogue parachute on the B-1B, which the Air Force says appears to be the source of the problem, is common across all aircraft with the ACES II. In June 2018 , the Air Force had grounded the B-1Bs after a harrowing in-flight emergency that led to one of the bombers landing with one of the crew members sitting on a live, misfired ACES II. An investigation determined that an improperly crimped part had led to the malfunction in that case. The Air Force lifted that grounding order within weeks, but acknowledged that some aircraft were still potentially flying with faulty ejection seats, something The War Zone was first to report on. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NvqB5kqhQEw At present, there are no B-1Bs deployed overseas, the Air Force told Military.com reporter Oriana Pawlyk‏. In April 2018 , a number of Bones had deployed to the Middle East to support operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. This U.S. military has been scaling this mission back since President Donald Trump declared his intention to withdraw from Syria in December 2018 . The United States said that the terrorists no longer controlled any territory as of Mar. 22, 2019 , but the group remains active and a serious threat in the region. The new grounding does come as the Air Force continues to struggle with improving the readiness rates of combat aircraft across the service after years of personnel shortages , constant combat operations , and budgetary issues . The Air Force did say it had finally rectified the shortfall in active duty maintainers in February 2019 . The B-1 fleet is also in the midst of an upgrade program to improve the avionics and other mission systems on the aircraft. This includes installing new digital multifunction displays throughout the cockpit. We will be sure to update this story with any new information as it emerges.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a follow-up piece to our recent article on the ballooning costs of the Air Force One replacement program, we have exclusive photos of the first of the two 747-8i airframes slated to be converted into new Air Force One aircraft—designated VC-25Bs—taking to the air for the first time since being stored in Victorville, California. In our previous piece, we noted that there was action around this aircraft, indicating that a flight may be near. The 747-8i, FAA registration number N894BA, flew directly from the Southern California Logistics Airport to Lackland AFB’s Kelly Field Annex in Texas —the same place where depot-level maintenance and modification occurs on the Air Force’s 747-based VC-25A and E-4B fleets. The transformation and entry into service for both 747-8i aircraft is now slated to cost $4.68B. The entire program, including infrastructure costs such as a new hangar at Andrews AFB to house the two jets—the existing hexagon shaped, bunker-like Air Force One hangar is only slightly too small—will bring the total program cost to $5.3B. The planes were once intended to be delivered to a Russian airline, but that never happened after it went bankrupt. As a result, supposedly President Donald Trump himself negotiated a bargain deal on the orphaned jets from Boeing, although evidence to support that claim doesn’t exist and the growing price tag of the Air Force One replacement program overall makes it all that much more questionable. Also, some have posited that buying aircraft that were already built to standard airline specifications may end up actually costing more to convert them into VC-25Bs compared to just ordering new aircraft as some modifications and provisions for certain unique systems, electromagnetic hardening, and wiring could not have been made on the production line and now they need to be retrofitted. Considering that a brand new 747-8i costs roughly $400M, the aircraft themselves were never a massive part of the overall program’s cost. The aircraft will look very different once it emerges from modification. It will sport a new Air Force One livery and be covered in defensive countermeasure systems , communications arrays , bulges form auxiliary power-related systems, and more., Matt Hartman/Shorealone Films It has been set for years that the aircraft would be transformed into VC-25Bs at Boeing’s Global Support Services facility at Kelly Field Annex, in San Antonio, Texas. Now that this process is about to begin, a real risk of cost growth exists, even though it would be astonishing considering the two aircraft are already looking to be the most expensive aircraft ever built. Boeing’s facility at Kelly Field Annex does major maintenance and modification work on the USAF’s largest aircraft. The huge free-standing hangar bay can accommodate over a dozen large aircraft at one time., Jrosales080878/wikicommons Regardless, a process has officially begun that aims to give birth to new Air Force One aircraft to replace the existing 747-200 based VC-25As that are approaching 30 years in age and becoming harder to maintain as first generation 747s of a similar design have all but disappeared from the skies. Rendering of what the VC-25Bs will look like once modified. , Boeing We will keep you posted as the process unfolds.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 11, 2018",24 F-22 Raptors Do The “Elephant Walk” In Alaska To Tout Their Readiness To Fight (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the USAF realigns its strategy towards “great power competition” with potential peer state enemies like Russia and China, high-profile displays of readiness among its combat aircraft fleets are becoming far more common than they were in the past . This time around, 3rd Wing based at Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage, Alaska showed off its might by concurrently generating a whopping 24 stealthy F-22 Raptors, an E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System aircraft, and a C-17 Globemaster III cargo jet—all of which call the base home. The 3rd Wing’s “ elephant walk ,” which occurred on March 26th, 2019, is uniquely important as the aircraft and airmen that make up the Wing would be among the first to rush to a crisis zone in the Pacific region. On top of that, the F-22s and E-3s based at Elmendorf AFB are the tip of America’s air defense spear for a huge block of airspace that backs up right against Russia’s own territory and the increasingly strategic Arctic region . 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, within a matter of minutes from when the klaxon sounds, a pair of fully armed and tanked-up F-22s can be scrambled into the air and race towards potential threats operating near U.S. airspace. Often times, a fully crewed E-3 follows right behind them. This happens far more often than most realize in an age of resurgent Russian long-range aviation forces. Russian strategic bombers, tankers, early warning and spy aircraft, and even escorting fighters are common visitors to the airspace off Alaska’s frigid shores. On a larger scale, during a big emergency or contingency operation, the airman at Elmendorf AFB may be tasked with generating as many Raptor sorties as possible in a minimal amount of time. So this elephant walk isn’t just a grand photo op, it is an opportunity for high-tempo training and internal evaluation. USAF A total of 47 F-22s called Elmendorf AFB home before Hurricane Michael slammed into Florida’s Tyndall AFB last October. Since then, a handful of that base’s jets have been redistributed to Alaska. As such, the total number of F-22s now assigned to the base is unknown. With this in mind, the elephant walk featured less than half of the Raptors housed there. This sounds a bit disappointing, but it really is quite impressive. The F-22A fleet suffers from less than stellar availability rates and at least three aircraft are sitting alert duty at any given time. In addition, it isn’t clear if any of the other Raptors stationed at Elmendorf AFB were away for training exercises, deployments, or depot-level maintenance work when the elephant walk occurred. Also, we know for a fact that a number of F-22s assigned to the base— at least three — were damaged in mishaps in 2018. These aircraft may not have been fully repaired and ready to fly when the exercise took place. Raptor distribution prior to Hurriane Michael. , GAO So, 3rd Wing did an impressive job showing its air combat muscle to the world and the inclusion of the E-3 and C-17 was absolutely great because it served as a reminder that the F-22 couldn’t do its job to anywhere near its potential without the help of those aircraft and the airmen who work so hard to keep them flying. It’s also worth noting that every single F-22 pictured is fitted with a pair of 600-gallon external fuel tanks. These jets weren’t just generated as they sat, they were configured to actually deploy abroad or to execute long-range air defense missions over the frigid northern reaches of American territory. This is also the same configuration of the base’s alert jets. With all that said, let’s enjoy some shots of Raptors in the wild set among some gorgeous Alaskan backdrops: 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing 3rd Wing Update: 12:50pm PDT— Apparently, this elephant walk is tied into a larger exercise called Polar Force. According to 3rd Wing, the “two-week exercise gives squadrons an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to forward deploy and deliver overwhelming combat airpower.” So, we may see more unique action out of the base in the days to come.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 31, 2019",U.S. Navy’s Troubled New Aircraft Carrier Delayed Again As Propulsion Issues Arise,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s troubled new supercarrier has yet another problem, this time with its nuclear powerplant system. The news comes along with the revelation that USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) will spend three extra months in dry dock as part of an extended maintenance and rework period, not returning to the fleet in any condition until at least sometime in October of 2019. The propulsion issues are in addition to a slew of other problems the carrier is facing. Collectively, they call into question when the ship will be ready for actual operational service at all. You can read all about the vessel’s other issues in our past reports linked here and here . Ford’s latest woes and the delay were first reported by USNI News’ Sam LaGrone . His report details how Ford’s powerplant was the source of an engineering casualty that resulted in the ship returning to port during a shakedown sortie. Apparently, the issue is with the ship’s steam turbines, not with the nuclear reactors that drive them, but could be systemic in nature. LaGrone writes: “Problems with the propulsion system are less understood publicly. The problem isn’t resident in the two nuclear reactors aboard but rather the ship’s main turbines generators that are driven by the steam the reactors produce. Sources familiar with the extent of the repairs have told USNI News two of the main turbine generators needed unanticipated and extensive overhauls. As Geurts told Congress, the ship’s company discovered the problem during sea trials. In May, Ford returned to port early after it suffered an engineering casualty during an underway ahead of the PSA [post shakedown availability]. … The initial 12-month post-shakedown availability (PSA) was designed to fix any problems that arose during the carrier’s first at-sea period, when the crew works the ship hard to help identify any problems in construction, as well as to tackle any work that the Navy and shipbuilder agreed to bump from the construction period to PSA. The carrier had planned to conduct a one-year PSA, then work up with its crew and deploy in 2021.” USN The report comes as the Navy is planning to bet even more heavily on the less than ready for combat Ford class design by purchasing two additional carriers in a block buy and retiring the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) with half its design life still ahead of it. Truman needs to receive its long-planned complex overhaul to realize its full-service life. Under the Navy’s plan, that operation would be canceled and relatively young supercarrier—it was commissioned in 1998—would be retired. This will eventually result in the U.S. Navy carrier force dropping to ten carriers instead of the Congressionally mandated 11. You can read all about the puzzling decision to retire the Truman in this past special feature of ours. With ongoing issues with the ship’s arresting gear, catapults, radar system, weapons elevators, and more, and now its powerplant, it’s not clear when Ford will be truly ready for operations. It has already been delayed significantly and this that is due to major developmental problems. Facing the challenge of meeting its operational design objectives is a whole other level of challenge altogether. Meanwhile, the second and third ships in the class, USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) and USS Enterprise (CVN-80), are already well under construction and slated to enter service in 2024 and 2028—if everything goes as planned. And now, with the block buy, another Ford class hull is under contract, the as yet to be named CVN-81. So, the Ford program has to get on track. These ships have to work and generate air sorties as intended. If they are not fully capable, they will blow a hole in the Navy’s ability to project power in the years to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Nov 12, 2019",This Gun Paired With New 6.8mm Ammunition Could Be The Army’s Next Standard Issue Rifle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Textron says it has delivered the first prototype of what could be the U.S. Army’s next standard-issue rifle, which will replace its M4 carbines, for testing. The company also says its design could be a springboard for more advanced small arms developments in the future. The Rhode-island headquartered defense contractor’s AAI Corporation subsidiary is the one in charge of the conglomerate’s submission for what Army refers formally as the Next Generation Squad Weapons program (NGSW). This effort includes plans for a new infantry rifle to take the place of the M4, or NGSW-R, and an automatic rifle replacement for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW), known as the NGSW-AR. AAI’s delivery, which Textron announced on Mar. 25, 2019 , is a technology demonstrator, known as the NGSW-Technology, or NGSW-T. It is the first of five guns that it will eventually supply to the Army as part of this initial phase of the NGSW-R competition. The service’s latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year asks for more than $30 million to support the ongoing research and development. We don’t know exactly what AAI’s design looks like, but an official press release stated that it leverages nearly 15 years of the company’s work on advanced small arms using what is known as cased-telescoped (CT) ammunition. In a traditional small arms cartridge, the bullet itself sits in place at the top of a metallic case filled with gunpowder. CT ammunition nestles the bullet inside the case with the gunpowder, shortening its overall length, which in turn allows for the length of the overall weapon to be more compact. It also makes the rounds themselves more compact, reducing the physical space required to store it, in magazines or elsewhere, reducing the burdens on troops and logistical chains. A comparison of traditional brass-cased ammunition, at left, and cased-telescoped ammunition, at right., Joseph Trevithick However, the Army’s NGSW requirements call for any submissions to use a special 6.8mm cartridge, known as the XM1186, which has a traditional configuration. This new round promises to have better range, improved accuracy at longer distances, and greater armor penetration capability over the existing 5.56x45mm ammunition the service uses now. The Army’s 2020 Fiscal Year budget request says the service is also developing a “special purpose” variant of the 6.8mm round, known as the XM1184, but does not explain how the two cartridges differ. AAI publicly unveiled a CT rifle design in 2018, which would be the obvious starting place for its gun chambered in the Army’s desired 6.8mm ammunition. The existing weapon has a general shape very similar to the service’s existing M4 carbine and features many of the same controls as other AR-15/M16-series firearms and derivatives, including the fire control selector and t-shaped charging handle. AAI’s cased-telescoped rifle concept is seen at the far right, next to examples of the company’s squad automatic rifle prototypes chambered in this same ammunition, as well as completely caseless rounds., Joseph Trevithick This general commonality with the Army’s existing standard issue weapon could make it particularly attractive. Any time a major U.S. military service adopts a new rifle, it’s not only a major logistical undertaking, but one that puts significant strains on training, as well. If what is known as the manual of arms – the typical actions associated with operating the gun, such as firing it, using its various controls, and clearing jams – between the M4 and whatever the Army adopts next remain largely the same, it would make it infinitely easier to integrate it into basic training and transition existing units to the new guns. The service says the new rifles will also feature standard rail accessories attachment points, allowing personnel to use existing lights, visible and infrared laser pointers, vertical forward grips, and other add-ons. US Army soldiers in Afghanistan train with their M4 carbines., NATO There is also a requirement for the guns to be able to accept a suppressor, something typically associated with special operations forces that is now looking to become more of a standard issue item for regular combat units . Suppressors, which help eliminate muzzle flash and reduce the sound of firing, can help conceal friendly forces from the enemy, especially at night, and help reduce the overall din of battle, making it easier for troops to communicate. “It’s [6.8mm] a higher caliber and a louder system, so the suppressor will help operationally,” Arthur Fiorellini, the NGSW program team leader at the Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, told Task & Purpose in February 2019. The Army is looking to add more complex technologies to the future, too. The most significant of these proposals is to develop a miniaturized ballistic computer, or a similar aid, to help soldiers quickly and accuracy engage their targets, even at extended ranges. AAI is certainly hoping that its previous experience and work directly with the Army in the past will give it a leg up in the competition, as well. Over the past 14 years, the firm has supplied a number of prototype squad automatic weapon demonstrators, using both CT and completely caseless ammunition, to the service for testing. A US Army soldier shoots a prototype AAI case-telescoped squad automatic weapon., US Army The service seems inclined to agree. In 2018, it rated the company’s submission for the automatic rifle component, then known as the Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle (NGSAR), as exceeding its demands both in terms of general concept and feasibility. None of the other entrants – General Dynamics , FN , PCP Tactical, and Sig Sauer – received this rating. AAI remains separately in the running for the revised NGSW-AR program, which will also fire the Army’s 6.8mm ammunition. The company’s pitch also seems to include a roadmap to potentially transitioning to CT ammunition, or maybe even caseless ammunition, at some point in the future. “Moving from contract award to delivery of a revolutionary, next-generation weapon in just 15 months not only demonstrates the maturity of our CT technology, but also the project execution excellence our team possesses to rapidly fill critical warfighter needs on schedule,” Textron Systems Senior Vice President of Applied Technologies & Advanced Programs Wayne Prender said in a press release on Mar. 25, 2019. “Our CT weapons and ammunition offer the growth path to a true next-generation small arms weapon for U.S. warfighters, including increased lethality at longer ranges, while also delivering significant weight reductions to the warfighter.” AAI’s existing CT ammunition design is not only shorter, but it also uses a polymer case. This means that in addition to its compact physical shape, it is also lighter weight compared to metal-cased ammunition. Earlier iterations of AAI’s cased-telescoped ammunition, as well as its fully caseless ammunition., US Army The scope of the NGSW program can only produce stiff competition for AAI, though. The prospect of winning contracts to replace hundreds of thousands of rifles across the US Army is too lucrative for most established firearms companies to pass up. If the longevity of the AR-15/M16 family in U.S. military service is any indication, it could set up the winner for years of support contracts, as well. Other services, such as the Marine Corps, could end up under pressure to adopt the new guns, too. Sig Sauer is preparing to submit a version of its increasingly popular MCX line , derived from the AR-15/M16 family, if it hasn’t already. The other entrants in the automatic rifle portion of NGSW program are no doubt crafting complimentary infantry rifle designs. These could come along with other novel ammunition concepts, as well. The Army is asking individual competitors to supply their own 6.8mm ammunition, as well as candidate guns. For instance, Sig Sauer has already shown a hybrid case design with a brass body on top of what could be a steel base, to reduce weight and cost. PCP Tactical, which has still yet to publicly show its prospective designs for either the infantry rifle or automtic rifle components of the NGSW program, is better knonw for producing lightweight polymer-cased ammunition rather than firearms, too. Sig Sauer’s MCX-based NGSW-R design. Note the hybrid-case ammunition at right, as well., Joseph Trevithick It’s also worth noting that this isn’t the first time the Army has sought to adopt a new standard infantry weapon in an improved caliber. This is a saga that has been going on for more than a decade, which you can read about in more detail here . Still, the service’s current leadership is adamant about modernizing and improving the lethality of its forces across the board, moving away from updating existing systems to fielding new ones. NGSW is very in line with this general thinking and the Army has an aggressive timetable in mind for fielding both the new infantry rifles and automatic rifles, with a goal of equipping the first unit with the new weapons by 2022 . With testing set to begin this year on all of the technology demonstrator prototypes, we may not have to wait long to see which designs the Army sees as leading contenders to become its next standard-issue rifle.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has conducted an important missile defense test from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. While officials at the base have declined to give any details about the experiment so far, earlier reports said it would be the first salvo test of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD, against a mock intercontinental ballistic missile , or ICBM. Vandenberg confirmed the launch occurred at around 10:30 AM local time, according to local media reports . Individuals reported seeing two distinct trails, further indicating that this was the salvo test. On Mar. 24, 2019, Bloomberg had been first to report that the experiment, officially known as Flight Test Ground-Based Midcourse Defense-11, or FTG-11, was most likely coming today. The Missile Defense Agency’s latest budget request for the 2020 Fiscal Year, which came out earlier in March 2019, describes FTG-11 as follows: “Flight Test Ground-based Midcourse Defense-11 (FTG-11), a 3-stage CE-II Block I and 3-stage CE-II Salvo intercepting GBIs launched from VAFB, against an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) target with associated objects, launched from Reagan Test Site (RTS) to test operational realism of the GMD salvo capability. Salvo intercept test requires additional resources from previous missions to support multiple interceptors: additional range support for mission execution and safety systems, silo refurbishment of two silos, additional data collectors, and additional post mission analyses.” “CE-II” refers to the latest operational iteration of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) on top of the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) missile. The EKV is a kinetic “hit-to-kill” weapon that physically slams into the target at high speed to destroy it. You can read more about the U.S. military’s overall concept for mid-course missile defense and its challenges here . “Associated objects” in this case are decoys meant to confuse the interceptors and the tracking network to draw the interceptors away from their intended targets. The video below offers more detail about how these kinds of countermeasures work in general. This salvo test is an extremely important test for the GMD, since it reflects an untested strategy to improve the system’s overall effectiveness. The EKVs have continually proven to be less than reliable during previous experiments, with half of the previous 18 test shots being failures. None of this has come cheap. As of 2018 , the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that the GMD’s total program cost was around $67 billion since the system first entered development in the 1990s. The last GMD flight test, FTG-15, which occurred in May 2017 and was the first against a mock ICBM, was a success , according to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). MDA also deemed the experiment before that in 2014, FTG-06B, involving the intercept of a shorter-range ballistic missile surrogate, successful. GMD interceptor in its silo., MDA Given the EKV’s track record, MDA has looked toward a new strategy involving firing a salvo of multiple interceptors in rapid succession against a single target to improve the likelihood that the target is destroyed. In addition, if the first intercept is successful, the second EKV could use its sensors to provide valuable confirmation of the kill, allowing missile defense units to quickly refocus their attention on other threats. But none of this means the salvo method is easier. “The test has been delayed by over a decade, as it may be the most challenging test in the program’s near-30-year history,” Cristina Chaplain, the director for space and missile defense systems related projects at GAO, told Bloomberg by Email. So, finally having FTG-15’s results will be an important first step in validating this concept. There are already concerns that the increase in the probability of kill from a salvo might be negligible if the EKVs remain unreliable in general. Raytheon, which is responsible for the EKV design, is already working on a replacement. In January 2018 , Boeing, the prime contractor on the GMD program, leading a team that includes Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, won a $6.6 billion contract for additional interceptors, a new launch silo, and the development of a Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV). This was all driven in no small part by North Korea’s debut of the Hwasong-15 ICBM the year before, which by every indication gives Pyongyang at least some capability to strike the United States proper. As such, the original goal was to test the first RKV in the 2020 Fiscal Year. Unfortunately, this schedule has now gotten pushed back by at least two years due to technical difficulties with the improved design. On March 22, 2019 , the Pentagon announced it was adding more than $4.1 billion to the Boeing-led team’s 2018 GMD contract, in part due to the RKV delay. Regardless of whether FTG-11 turns out to be a success or failure officially, there will also be significant questions about how much the test actually reflects a real-world scenario. The vast majority of previous GMD experiments have been highly scripted and involved mock targets that do not mirror threats from North Korea or any of America’s other potential adversaries . Experts have also criticized the decoys used in previous tests as being not representative of the countermeasures that the interceptors are likely to face. This test also underlines the reality of just how unproven and immature the system still is after many years of development and tens of billions of dollars spent. The fact that a salvo intercept has never been attempted against a single ICBM even after 40 interceptors have been installed in Fort Greely, Alaska is telling. At this point, even defending against an attack by a rogue state such as North Korea seems questionable at best, but this test could inspire better confidence in the system, even if to just a limited degree. MDA Hopefully, we will get more information about FTG-11 soon to get a better understanding of the test’s parameters and its results. We will update this story as more information becomes available. UPDATE: 5:30pm EST— ABC News has now reported that MDA declared the test a success, but without offering any more details. UPDATE: 6:15pm EST— MDA has now released an official statement that includes the following details: The U.S. Missile Defense Agency, in cooperation with the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense, U.S. Northern Command, and elements of the U.S. Air Force Space Command’s 30th, 50th, and 460th Space Wings, conducted a successful test today against an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) class target. This test was the first salvo engagement of a threat-representative ICBM target by two Ground Based Interceptors (GBI), which were designated GBI-Lead, and GBI-Trail for the test.  The GBI-Lead destroyed the reentry vehicle, as it was designed to do.  The GBI-Trail then looked at the resulting debris and remaining objects, and, not finding any other reentry vehicles, selected the next ‘most lethal object’ it could identify, and struck that, precisely as it was designed to do. The threat-representative ICBM target was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, over 4,000 miles away from the two GBI interceptors, which were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. During the test, space, ground and sea-based BMDS sensors provided real-time target acquisition and tracking data to the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communication (C2BMC) system.  The two GBIs were then launched and the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles successfully engaged the target complex, resulting in an intercept of the target. Initial indications show the test met requirements. Program officials will continue to evaluate system performance based upon telemetry and other data obtained during the test. As was the case with FTG-15 in 2017, this statement does not offer specific details about the “threat-representative ICBM target.” As noted, in the previous test, the surrogate ICBM was not representative of North Korea’s Hwasong-15. In addition, it is interesting to note that the statement includes the caveat “Initial indications show the test met requirements.” After the 2017 FTG-15 test, MDA released a statement with a slightly different caveat that pointedly noted “the test met its primary objective.” UPDATE: 6:50pm EST— We now have unofficial video of the test, as well. UPDATE: 9:20pm EST— Northrop Grumman has issued the following statement about the test, as well: In an unprecedented display of accuracy, Northrop Grumman Corporation, (NYSE: NOC) as the strategic partner to prime contractor, Boeing, successfully provided the weapon task plans for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system Ground Based Interceptors (GBI) during the first dual interceptor mission against an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) target for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA). “This critical test of the nation’s defense shield showcases Northrop Grumman’s launch vehicles and our battlefield management and fire control capabilities,” said Dan Verwiel, vice president and general manager, missile defense and protective systems, Northrop Grumman. “We are proud to play an integral role on a system that is so vital to the security of our country. This was a very challenging test and I congratulate the MDA and the entire team on their excellent performance.” During the GMD flight test, known as FTG-11, a Northrop Grumman-produced ICBM target threat was fired from a launch complex at Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Marshall Islands. Northrop Grumman’s ground systems integrated data from a space sensor with data from land and sea-based radars, created a battle plan, communicated with the silos to launch two ground-based interceptors powered by the company’s boost vehicles, and guided the interceptors to the target where the kill vehicles destroyed the threat. “Today’s mission was the most complex GMD test conducted thus far,” said Rich Straka, vice president and general manager, launch vehicles, Northrop Grumman. “This was the first time Northrop Grumman had three rockets operating at the same time; two interceptors launched against our target, and the systems worked as planned.” As the strategic partner of The Boeing Company for the MDA’s GMD program, Northrop Grumman provides the deputy program director and is responsible for the development, integration, operations and sustainment of the ground systems and interceptor boost vehicle. Under contract directly to MDA, Northrop Grumman designs, builds and launches the ICBM target rocket. UPDATE: 3/26/2019— MDA has now released its own official video, which includes an “on-board sensor view” from the EKV’s perspective and separate clips of the actual moment of intercept.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 8, 2019",Morocco Cleared To Buy 25 Advanced F-16s And Upgrade Its Existing Fleet To F-16V Standard,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has approved the sale of 25 new F-16 Block 72s to Morocco, as well as an upgrade package to bring that country’s existing Viper fleet up to the very similar F-16V standard . If the North African nation were to pursue both deals, it would effectively double the size of the Royal Morocco Air Force’s F-16 fleet and significantly increase its combat capabilities. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the U.S. military’s central foreign sales office, issued separate statements about the two potential deals on Mar. 25, 2019. The upgrade package , valued at more than $985 million, covers the cost of bringing the RMAF’s 23 existing F-16C/D Block 52+ aircraft up to the F-16V standard, as well as a variety of other ancillary items and support services. The purchase of the 25 new Block 72 aircraft , which also includes various other equipment, weapons, and services, comes with a price tag of $3.8 billion. “The purchase will improve interoperability with the United States and other regional allies and enhance Morocco’s ability to undertake coalition operations, as it has done in the past in flying sorties against ISIS in Syria and Iraq,” the statement regarding the Block 72 aircraft says. “Morocco already operates an F‑16 fleet and will have no difficulty absorbing this aircraft and services into its armed forces.” The press release regarding the F-16V upgrade deal includes similar language. Both notices also make mention of Morocco’s status as a major non-NATO U.S. ally and an important American partner in North Africa and elsewhere. If Morocco does decide to buy the new-build aircraft, it would be the second country to purchase examples of Lockheed Martin’s most advanced F-16s to date and the first to purchase the Block 72 configuration specifically. In June 2018 , Bahrain became the first customer for new F-16 Block 70 aircraft. Just last week , reports emerged that the U.S. government might also approve sales of the Block 70 to Taiwan. The difference between the two subvariants is that the Block 70s have a version of General Electric F110 engine , while the 72s have the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine . Otherwise, both aircraft share all of the other significant upgrades over previous F-16s, including the AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), an active electronically scanned array type, as well as an overhauled glass cockpit, new mission computers, an advanced electronic warfare suite for self-defense, improved data links, provisions for the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), and more, which you can read about in more detail here . An artist’s rendition of a future F-16 Block 70 for Bahrain. Morocco’s jets would be in the same general configuration, except for the different engine., Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin originally developed the Block 70 for India, but recently rebranded that country-specific configuration as the F-21 . The F-16V is an upgrade package for older Vipers that brings them up to a near identical standard to Block 70/72 aircraft. Taiwan and Greece are both upgrading their existing F-16 fleets to the V configuration, as well. For Morocco, the potential purchases, including the upgrades, would dramatically expand the country’s air combat capabilities, while also creating a common standard across its entire Viper fleet. Its Block 52+ jets already use the F100-PW-229 engine, which they will retain when the go through the F-16V upgrade process. This means that all of the RMAF’s Vipers will share the same engine at the end of the day, helping to keep the service’s maintenance and logistical demands to a minimum. Morocco’s Block 52+ aircraft were already among some of the more advanced Vipers out there and are very new by fighter jet standards, with the RMAF only starting to receive the aircraft in 2011. All of Morocco’s Block 52+ jets already have provisions for conformal fuel tanks and its two seat F-16Ds feature an enlarged dorsal spine, which can accommodate avionics, communications equipment, countermeasures systems, and more. It’s also worth noting that the possible F-16V upgrade deal and the potential purchase of the new Block 72 jets each include six DB-110 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance pods. Derived from the Senior Year Electro-Optical System (SYERS) for the U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane, this is an extremely capable system that can capture high-fidelity imagery and can do so at extended ranges using a slant flight profile. Already popular among Viper operators, the latest examples of the DB-110 offer multi-spectral sensor fusion capabilities, making the system even more powerful. You can read more about this system here . A DB-110 on a Polish F-16., Collins Aerospace A fleet of upgraded F-16Vs and Block 72 Vipers could only improve Morocco’s ability to contribute to future operations with the U.S. military. As DSCA noted, the RMAF’s existing F-16s have already taken part in American-led operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the first ever combat operations for the country’s Vipers. On Mar. 25, 2019, the same day DSCA disclosed the two potential F-16-related deals, U.S. Africa Command announced the beginning of the annual African Lion training exercise, which occurs every year in Morocco and that often involves elements of the RMAF. This year’s iteration of the drill also includes exercises in Tunisia. A Moroccan F-16D Block 52+ moves into position to refuel from a US Air Force KC-135 tanker during the 2018 iteration of African Lion. A US Air Force B-52 bomber is in the background, flanked by Moroccan Mirage F1 jets., USAF Drills like African Lion only underscoring centuries-long ties between the two countries, too. Morocco was the first ever nation to recognize the independence of the United States and it has the longest unbroken treaty relationship of any country with the U.S. government, dating back to the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship, which the two parties signed in 1786. Morocco’s new and upgraded F-16s would be a boon to any combined operations with their other international partners, as well. In addition to taking part in the anti-ISIS campaign in recent years, the country’s F-16s have also flown missions against Houthi rebels as part of the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in Yemen. In 2015 , a Moroccan F-16 crashed in that country. The Houthis claimed to have shot it down, but Morocco said the mishap was the result of a technical fault. Morocco reportedly pulled out of the controversial campaign in Yemen in late 2018 , with another report in February 2019 saying the country had also recalled its ambassador from Saudi Arabia. Reported wreckage of #Morocco Air Force F-16 lost during #Yemen operations http://t.co/bZUOnFm0vp pic.twitter.com/x5H7CQ0puD — Joseph Dempsey (@JosephHDempsey) May 11, 2015 A sale of new Block 72 jets to Morocco would also be important for Lockheed Martin, which recently shrunk its F-16 production line and moved it to South Carolina . The Block 70 jets for Bahrain will be the first ones produced at the new facility. Another order for the RMAF would help keep the production line operating well into the 2020s. The possible sale of F-16V upgrade packages and new Block 70/72 aircraft to Morocco make it clear that many countries still see the Viper as a capable and efficient platform and one that can remain relevant, with the help of updates, for many years to come. USAF We have posted what is included specifically in both deals below. The new F-16C/D sale includes: The Government of Morocco has requested to buy twenty-five (25) F-16C/D Block 72 aircraft; twenty-nine (29) engines (Pratt & Whitney F100-229) (includes 4 spares); twenty-six (26) APG-83 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars (includes 1 spare); twenty-six (26) Modular Mission Computers (includes 1 spare); twenty-six (26) Link-16 Multifunctional Information Distribution Systems – JTRS (MIDS-JTRS) with TACAN and ESHI Terminals (includes 1 spare); twenty-six (26) LN260 Embedded Global Navigation Systems (EGI) (includes 1 spare); forty (40) Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS) (includes 5 spares); twenty-six (26) Improved Programmable Display Generators (iPDG) (includes 1 spare); thirty (30) M61 Al Vulcan 20mm Guns (includes 5 spares); fifty (50) LAU-129 Multi-Purpose Launchers; forty (40) AIM-120C-7 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM); forty (40) AIM-120C-7 Guidance Sections; three (3) GBU-38/54 JDAM Tail Kits; fifty (50) MXU-650 Air Foil Group, GBU-49; fifty (50) MAU-210 Enhanced Computer Control Group (CCG), GBU-49,-50; thirty-six (36) FMU-139 D/B Fuzes; six (6) FMU-139 D/B (D-l) Inert Fuzes; two (2) GBU-39 (T-l) GTVs; sixty (60) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB I); ten (10) MAU-169L/B Computer Control Group, GBU-10,-12,-16; ten (10) MXU-650C/B Air Foil Group, GBU-12; twelve (12) MK82 Bombs, Filled Inert; four (4) BLU-109 Practice Bombs; ten (10) MAU-169 CCG (D-2); and twenty-six (26) AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Pods.  Also included are twenty-six (26) AN/ALQ-213 EW Management Systems; twenty-six (26) Advanced Identification Friend/Foe; Secure Communications, Cryptographic Precision Navigation Equipment; one (1) Joint Mission Planning System; twenty-six (26) AN/ALQ-211 AIDEWS; six (6) DB-110 Advanced Reconnaissance Systems; communications equipment; spares and repair parts; support equipment; personnel training and training equipment; publications and technical documentation; support and test equipment, simulators; integration and test; U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistical support services; and other related elements of logistics and program support.  The estimated cost is $3.787 billion.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 1, 2019",Russian Transport Aircraft Deliver Men And Materiel To Venezuela Direct From Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A Russian Air Force An-124 Condor heavy transport plane is back home after a brief trip to Venezuela, where it helped reportedly deliver almost 100 military personnel and tons of unspecified cargo as part of the Kremlin’s ongoing support for embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. For two months now, Maduro has been locked in a political crisis with American-supported opposition leader Juan Guaido and there continue to be signs that a U.S. military intervention might be on the horizon. The An-124, along with a Russian Air Force Il-62M passenger transport, arrived at Simón Bolívar International Airport in Venezuela’s capital Caracas on Mar. 23, 2019. Both aircraft originated in Russia, but the Il-62M stopped in the Syrian capital Damascus before heading off to South America, while the An-124 flew through the Russian military’s Khmeimim air base outpost , also in Syria. Subsequent photographs show Russian personnel on the tarmac wearing desert camouflage uniforms and baseball caps similar, if not identical, to the ones commonly seen on the Kremlin’s troops in Syria. The An-124 left on Mar. 25, 2019. It’s unclear if the Il-62M is still in Venezuela. “[The Russian troops and cargo] arrived to take part in bilateral consultations,” an unnamed diplomatic source told Russian state media outlet Sputnik on Mar. 25, 2019. “Russia [and Venezuela] have a number of contracts, which are being implemented, including contracts on military and technical cooperation.” The day before, the Associated Press reported that Russia had dispatched the planes and their cargo to “discuss equipment maintenance and training, and strategy,” citing an anonymous Venezuelan official. At the time of writing, there does not appear to be an official Russian government statement about the deployment. Russian personnel at Khmeimim during a ceremony in May 2017 to mark the anniversary of Russia’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The uniforms seen here are essentially identical to the ones that the individuals who arrived in Venezuela on Mar. 23, 2019 were wearing., Dmitriy Vinogradov/Sputnik  via AP The claim from Sputnik about the purpose of this deployment seems very difficult to believe. Russia has sold significant amounts of weapons and military equipment to Venezuela, but the bulk of those contracts are concluded. At present, the biggest remaining deal is regarding Venezuelan production of AK-103 assault rifles . There’s no clear reason why there would be a need to deploy uniformed service members in relation to the establishment of that factory—tasks better suited to civilian technicians and representatives from Russia’s arms exports agencies. Even if there was a need for actual troops, it’s hard to see why the Kremlin would have chosen to employ individuals serving in Syria for this purpose. This also represents a withdrawal from that theater, where the Kremlin remains actively engaged . It seems much more plausible that these personnel are in Venezuela to help bolster Maduro’s regime in some way. In January 2019, Russia reportedly sent shadowy mercenaries to the country, potentially to shield the Venezuela President from a coup. That same month, Juan Guiado, then-President of the country’s National Assembly, had declared himself Interim President and received widespread international recognition. Multiple members of the Venezuelan military and security forces have since defected to Guaido’s camp. Juan Guaido, holding a Venezuelan flag, sings the national anthem in front of a crowd at Simón Bolívar International Airport after returning on Mar. 4, 2019 from a trip to meet foreign supporters., Rafael Hernandez/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP Images However, Russia has employed these private military companies in the past as deniable proxies , refusing to acknowledge them as Russian personnel or come to their aid during any major confrontation with foreign military forces. As such, while they might have been useful in protecting Maduro from domestic opposition, actual uniformed troops on the ground serve as a much more pointed challenge to any outside country, such as the United States, which might be considering launching a military intervention on behalf of Guaido. Beyond just being in Venezuela, there are many practical benefits that this force, coming from active duty in an actual warzone in Syria, might offer. For instance, the Russian contingent might also be in the country to assist Venezuela in improving the readiness of its Russian-supplied S-300VM surface-to-air missile systems. Since February 2019, ImageSat International (iSi), a private satellite imagery and geospatial intelligence firm, has noted what appears to be a significant uptick in activity surrounding the country’s S-300VM unit at Capitán Manuel Ríos Airbase, which is situated around 75 miles south of Caracas. Russia’s S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in Syria, along with its other shorter-range air defenses there, have also been a major factor in ensuring the survival of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad and his regime in recent years. Russia’s air defenders serving in that country would have more real-world experience than any other Russian units—lessons learned that could only be valuable for Venezuelan forces looking to reestablish their overall proficiency with the S-300VM. A transporter-erector-launcher from one of Venezuela’s S-300VM surface-to-air missile systems on parade in 2014., Ricardo Patiño The new Russian contingent might also be an advance team for the deployment of additional forces, including combat aircraft. Just in December 2018, Russia had deployed a pair of Tu-160 Blackjack bombers to Venezuela in what was a clear demonstration of support for Maduro and an obvious signal to the United States. An An-124 and an Il-62M also brought in additional personnel and equipment to support that deployment. After those bombers arrived, there were subsequent reports that Russia had accepted a Venezuelan offer to establish a formal base on the island of La Orchila in the Caribbean, a plan that remains unconfirmed and would take years to implement. The Kremlin could decide to make another short-term deployment of combat aircraft to again try to dissuade Marduro’s opponents, including the United States, for launching a military operation into the country. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6QvUWz7oYno Venezuela could also just have a need for help in operating and maintain other more advanced Russian-made systems, including combat jets and helicopters. In February 2019 , a Venezuelan Russian-built Mi-35 Hind gunship helicopter crashed during a training exercise, raising questions about the general state of the country’s military readiness. Russia’s Khmeimim base serves primarily as a major aviation hub for the Kremlin’s forces in Syria. The personnel and equipment now in Venezuela could be maintainers arriving to help ensure the country’s combat jets, such as its Russian-made Su-30MKV Flanker-C fighter jets, and helicopters are in good working order. A Venezuelan Air Force Su-30MKV Flanker-C., André Austin Du-Pont Rocha via Wikimedia These types of advise and assist missions would fit well with the Associated Press ’ report that the Russians are in the country for “maintenance and training, and strategy” reasons. Having uniformed Russian advisors on the ground at air defense sites and other strategic locations also creates further difficulties for any U.S. military intervention. The danger would be that strikes on any of those locations might result in the death of the Kremlin’s personnel, which could cause a much more serious international incident. We also already know that concerns about Venezuelan air defenses and combat aircraft contributed to an uptick in U.S. military to intelligence gathering sorties ahead of U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III transport planes shuttling in humanitarian aid to a stage base in neighboring Colombia in February 2019. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint spy planes continue to be a regular sight off the coast. These aircraft have the capability to gather details on an enemy’s “ electronic order of battle ,” classifying and geo-locating air defense nodes, such as radars associated with surface-to-air missile systems. They can also intercept valuable communications chatter that can give more insight on an opponent’s activities and future plans. “It wasn’t … the normal type of C-17 run that we do to South America, or to Colombia specifically.” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Amilcar Melendez-Cruz, the Assistant Director of Operations for the 15th Airlift Squadron and the office in charge of the aid deliveries on Feb. 16, 2019, said in an interview with Air Force Magazine . “This included going to a field that was on the border with Venezuela, so there was some concern about dealing with Venezuela, Venezuelan airspace, different friendly and non-friendly assets.” Regardless, the increasingly dictatorial Venezuelan leader is a major Russian ally and a key Kremlin partner in the Western hemisphere. Russia has made no secret of its desire to keep him in power and has said it is willing to take steps necessary to ward off any U.S. government attempt to change the regime in Caracas. It’s important to note that there is still no concrete evidence that the United States, or any of its allies, are actively planning to intervene militarily in Venezuela to uproot Maduro. Still, there have been a number of developments that strongly hint at discussions within the U.S. government about just such an operation. On Mar. 14, 2019, the U.S. State Department pulled the last of its personnel from Venezuela, individuals who U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had described as a “constraint on U.S. policy.” This suggested that their continued presence in the country posed an unnecessary additional risk in the event of a military operation. “Secretary [Pompeo] told Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov that the United States and regional countries will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela,” a State Department press release said on Mar. 25, 2019 . “The continued insertion of Russian military personnel to support the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela risks prolonging the suffering of the Venezuelan people who overwhelmingly support interim President Juan Guaido.” Other members of President Donald Trump’s administration continue to stress that “ all options are on the table” to ensure an eventual transition of power to Guaido. Trump himself has reportedly expressed a desire for a military option to ending Venezuela’s years-long economic and political crisis on multiple occasions , even before Guaido emerged a major opponent to Maduro’s power. With Russian troops on the ground and advising and assisting Venezuelan forces loyal to Maduro, the Kremlin is clearly trying to add even more risks for anyone looking to unseat their ally in Caracas.

This time it was the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur and the first in her class USCGC Bertholf , a Legend class National Security Cutter. A similar transit occurred a month ago and drew the ire of Beijing. The Taiwan Strait is very heavily militarized and highly monitored on both sides of the channel. At its tightest point, it is just roughly 80 miles wide. During a conflict, it would become a super-missile engagement zone the likes of which we have never seen. The freedom of navigation drill comes as reports indicate the Trump Administration is prepared to do what Beijing has long said is a geopolitical “red line”—sell advanced new-build F-16s to Taiwan. You can read all about purported F-16 deal and the issues surrounding it in this recent article of ours . Relations between the U.S. and China are far from bright at this time. The U.S. is currently in a protracted trade dispute with China. Direct negotiations have been ongoing for months, but key issues remain unresolved. This is in addition to China’s extraterritorial expansionism in the South China Sea and other rising territorial disputes with its neighbors. Yet above all else, the country’s quickly expanding and advancing military might has drawn the most concern from the Pentagon. USS Curtis Wilbur (DDG-54) sailing near Japan. , USN The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), in particular, is ballooning in size and capability at an alarming rate. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has recently concluded that much of the Chinese military build up is spurred by its intention to deter Taiwanese pro-independence movements and eventually take back sovereignty over the island. The Taiwan Strait remains the tinderbox in the standoff between Beijing and Taipei. The upticks in U.S. transits through the strait followed Xi Jinping’s January 2nd remarks —a date that marked the 40th-anniversary cross-strait ceasefire. The speech could be characterized as a mix of olive branches and sticks, but it was received as quite ominous by many. In the speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping made it clear that unification of what China views as a rogue province is a top priority for the Chinese Government and that military options are on the table if more peaceful means don’t work. Xi Jinping also focused some of his most bellicose rhetoric toward external military powers that support Taiwan’s ongoing independence—namely the United States. Xi Jinping has deep ties to the military dating back many decades in his career. Here he is seen aboard the carrier Liaoning in the South China Sea. , Chinese Government With all this in mind, the Taiwan Strait appears to be heating up both geopolitically and militarily and it could very well reach a boiling point with all tensions among the three parties. China has become far more assertive towards the U.S. when it comes to using its naval power to confront American naval vessels in its claimed territorial waters. A very close encounter between U.S. and Chinese destroyers in the South China Sea recently is probably the best example of this. You can read about that incident here . An event like that happening in the Taiwan Strait could have far more explosive repercussions. As to why a U.S. Coast Guard ship was even in the region for such a mission, most people don’t realize that the Coast Guard deploys around the globe regularly and often times into some pretty rough neighborhoods. Before moving south, through the Taiwan Strait, Bertholf was working in an interdiction role off the coast of the Korean Peninsula in an effort to enforce the bevy of sanctions placed on North Korea for their nuclear and missile programs. USCGC Bertholf. , USCG The Legend class is the Coast Guard’s most capable class of ships and feature SEWIP electronic warfare and Phalanx defenses , in addition to a Mk110 57mm deck gun, as well as smaller guns. Expendable decoys also are on hand to help in evading an anti-ship missile attack. The ships also feature a hangar bay for two embarked MH-65 Dolphin helicopters and a rear ramp for launching and recovering small boats that are often used for boarding, search, and seizure operations. Bertholf also packs a highly-trained and well-equipped Maritime Security Response Team (MSRT). An image taken on February 5th, 2019, showing USCGC Bertholf’s embarked MSRT training aboard. , USCGC Bertholf’s Facebook page These elite units are basically the Coast Guard’s special operations teams that specialize in counter-terror operations in the maritime environment. They are truly one of the cutter’s most potent weapons when embarked. By traveling with an Aegis combat system-equipped destroyer through the tense body of water, the cutter can operate under the destroyer’s protective anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine umbrella. Still, the use of the cutter for this mission is somewhat unique. Overseas USCG operations are more about sea control, interdiction, and working with local allies in law enforcement roles than straight-up power projection. With this latest maneuver in mind, it will be interesting to see if the U.S. Coast Guard starts executing more high-profile freedom of navigation operations in the future. As for the shaky relationship between the U.S., China, and Taiwan, it appears that the Trump Administration has decided to turn up the heat in Beijing by sending it clear reminders that the U.S. won’t be told what to do, where to do, or with who in the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 24, 2018",The Two Sort Of New Air Force One Jets Now To Cost Nearly The Price Of A Nimitz Class Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Few defense programs have gotten as much attention in recent years as the Air Force One replacement program. This is mainly due to President Trump’s persistent claims about directly working a deal with Boeing for the aircraft that would save huge sums of money. These assertions have repeatedly proven to be hollow and now it is becoming clear that the program’s price tag has actually leaped considerably. Marcus Weisgerber of Defense One has done an outstanding job on keeping on top of the ever-morphing Air Force One replacement program. In his latest piece , he notes that the entire program cost, which includes infrastructure projects and a bevy on ancillary items, is now pegged at a whopping $5.3B. This is roughly a third more than the figure the Air Force has touted in the past for the program. But what’s even more concerning is that the cost of the planes themselves and the conversion of them into militarized VC-25Bs, now stands at $4.68B. This is approximately $780 million more than the long-standing program cost estimate of around $3.9B that the Air Force had routinely given out to the public. The figure that the Air Force gave to Defense One , $5.3B, is also curious. In 2018, the White House said that Trump’s purported deal with Boeing had shaved approximately $1.5B off the total cost, but The War Zone and others noted that the final price tag had not actually changed from the Air Force’s previous estimate. However, $3.9B plus $1.5B is $5.4B, which is very close to the estimate of what the two new VC-25Bs will cost, inclusive of all necessary related items, which can only further call into question the claim from the Trump Administration that the program is less expensive in any way now than it was last year. That $4.68B figure is for just two aircraft, both of which aren’t even exactly new. They have been baking in the Mojave Desert for years. The two 747-8is were built for the defunct Russian airline Transero, which went bankrupt in 2015. Aeroflot bought up most its assets, but had no interest in the 747-8is. So, Boeing flew the jets to Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville where they have been stored in the open ever since. A photo of the two orphaned 747-8is that are slated to become Air Force One. The images were taken on March 24th, 2019 and show some activity around one of the aircraft. , Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com After Trump took office and made the program a pet project , it was announced that those planes would be used as the base aircraft for the future Air Force Ones and were bought from Boeing at some incredible price that remains undisclosed. Although the Air Force One mission is critical, procuring two aircraft at a price tag that approaches the cost of a Nimitz class nuclear supercarrier sure seems concerning. On top of buying the not really new planes, critical capabilities have been cut to save money, including the VC-25B’s ability to refuel in flight from Air Force tankers—a feature the 30-year-old VC-25As that are to be replaced have. Taking the lower figure for the aircraft, their conversion, and entry into service, these planes should surpass the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber as the most expensive aircraft ever built. In fact, according to Defense One , their combined cost, including infrastructure projects and some other ancillary costs associated with the program, exceeds what the Navy says a Nimitz class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier historically costs —about $4.5B. Even the highest estimates on the last Nimitz class carrier built give the ship a $6.2B price tag , not even a billion more than the Air Force One replacement program. The larger figure that Defense One puts forward, which includes infrastructure and other projects associated with the aircraft, is also roughly the same cost of two Virginia class nuclear fast attack submarines. Rendering of VC-25Bs., Boeing Nothing about Presidential transport is cheap, especially when it comes to flying . These planes have to be survivable against electromagnetic pulses and need to be equipped with the latest defensive and communications suites . Lots of other specific pieces of hardware and systems also have to be integrated and those systems need power and some also need cooling. It all has to work together properly as not just the safety of the President is on the line, but also the credibility of America’s nuclear deterrent. If the President is onboard Air Force One during a crisis, that’s where he or she would order the National Command Authority to execute a nuclear strike. But still, we are talking about such huge sums of money here that it’s all just a little perplexing. The real program cost appears to be $5.3B at this point. For two aircraft and the support infrastructure to sustain them. The sticker price of a new Boeing 747-8i is roughly $400M. So, we are talking about six and a half times the cost of the aircraft to outfit them and convert operations over from the earlier 747 derivatives, the VC-25As. But it’s not like the USAF is starting from scratch. Far from it actually. VC-25A “Air Force One” seen during President Trump’s recent visit to Alabama. , AP Yes, the 747-8i is significantly different aircraft than the 747-200 first-generation Jumbo Jet derivative it is slated to replace, but the USAF has been upgrading the VC-25As continuously ever since they entered service. They have modern communications and defensive systems and the USAF understands the Presidential airlift mission using the 747 incredibly well. So, it’s not like they are being asked to do something that has never been done or to develop all new subsystems to do it. Choosing the 747-8i has induced some unique costs. For instance, the custom-built, bunker-like hexagon-shaped hangar that houses the VC-25As at Andrews Air Force Base won’t work for the new planes. The aircraft is slightly too large, so a whole new facility needs to be built. The custom built VC-25A hangar at Andrews AFB., Google Earth. DoD At this point, the USAF’s investments made to develop a VC-25B aircraft are very unlikely to be ported over to future projects that also use the 747-8i airframe, either. The type will likely go out of production in the coming decade. 24 747-8s are on back order , which equates to roughly four years of work. The prospects for significantly more orders are highly questionable at best. So, by the time the new Air Force Ones enter service, the 747 line could very well be shutting down for good. The USAF is looking for a common airframe to replace its C-32A , E-6B , and E-4B aircraft, one which would almost certainly be smaller in size than a 747-8i. This will most likely be based on the KC-46 , a 767 derivative that has already been militarized and equipped with defensive systems, secure communications, and more. So, all the VC-25B development costs are a one-shot deal for the USAF. It’s all for just two jets. As such, using Defense One’s numbers, the total program cost spread across the two airframes is now pegged at $2.68B each and $2.34B using the smaller figure associated just with the aircraft themselves. It will be interesting to see how the Air Force justifies this enormous price tag and how the costs are actually broken down. But considering how hush-hush things are regarding Air Force One and its configuration, the public may never get a full explanation of why these planes and their entry into service cost nearly as much as a Nimitz class supercarrier.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 24, 2019",Trump Admin Will Reportedly Approve Sale Of New F-16s To Taiwan And China Will Absolutely Freak,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A report from Bloomberg states that Taiwan’s recent request for 60 new-build advanced Block 70 F-16s will be approved by the Trump Administration. If this sale actually comes to pass, it would be in addition to the country’s 145 Block 20 F-16A/B aircraft that are currently being upgraded to the nearly identical F-16V standard. China has long said it draws a “red line” at the U.S. furnishing new-build advanced F-16 to Taiwan. If the deal is approved, it is sure to infuriate Beijing at a particularly contentious moment in U.S.-Chinese relations history. An ongoing and wide-ranging trade dispute, as well as increased tensions with its neighbors, its ongoing military buildup, the unending nuclear standoff with North Korea, and its island building campaign in the South China Sea are just some of the factors that have put major pressure on the already less than sturdy relationship between the two countries.Â The deal to upgrade Taiwan’s aging fleet of F-16s came after the Obama Administration rejected Taipei’s wish to buy new F-16s. In reality, the upgrade gives Taiwan nearly the same capabilities of new-build F-16s, including the installation of AN/APG-83 SABR active electronically scanned array radars, fully upgraded cockpit displays and mission computers, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), advanced defensive suite, data-links, and so on.Â Lockheed Martin Because of the age of Taiwan’s F-16s, the deal also includes a structural upgrade and other airframe modification work. What it lacks is the F-16 Block 70’s 29,000-pound or even 32,000-pound thrust class engine, conformal fuel tanks, and the airframe enhancements that have come as a result of decades of F-16 production. Part of the $5.3B deal does include a study to see if the jet’s engines could be upgraded. So far, no operational F-16A/B has ever been upgraded with the more powerful engines. The entire list of items in the sale was released by the U.S. Government. It reads: “The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States has requested a retrofit of 145 F-16A/B aircraft that includes sale of: 176 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars; 176 Embedded Global Positioning System Inertial Navigation Systems; 176 ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management systems; upgrade 82 ALQ-184 Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) pods to incorporate Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) technology or purchase new ECM pods (AN/ALQ-211(V)9 Airborne Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suites (AIDEWS) with DRFM, or AN/ALQ-131 pods with DRFM); 86 tactical data link terminals; upgrade 28 electro-optical infrared targeting Sharpshooter pods; 26 AN/AAQ-33 SNIPER Targeting Systems or AN/AAQ-28 LITENING Targeting Systems; 128 Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems; 128 Night Vision Goggles; 140 AIM-9X SIDEWINDER Missiles; 56 AIM-9X Captive Air Training Missiles; 5 AIM-9X Telemetry kits; 16 GBU-31V1 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) kits; 80 GBU-38 JDAM kits; Dual Mode/ Global Positioning System Laser-Guided Bombs (16 GBU-10 Enhanced PAVEWAY II or GBU-56 Laser JDAM, 80 GBU-12 Enhanced PAVEWAY II or GBU-54 Laser JDAM, 16 GBU-24 Enhanced PAVEWAY III); 64 CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapons with Wind-Corrected Munition Dispensers (WDMD); 153 LAU-129 Launchers with missile interface; upgrade of 158 APX-113 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe Combined Interrogator Transponders; and HAVE GLASS II applications.

The installation of upgrade kits is being done locally by the state-owned Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC). You can read more about the deal in this past article of ours .Â First F-16V to be modified in Taiwan. ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ pic.twitter.com/mT60QLuffi — Alert 5 (@alert5) June 10, 2018 The move to upgrade Taiwan’s Vipers staved off what could have been a significant geopolitical spat between the U.S. and China. But that could all change if Taiwan ends up getting its entire F-16 fleet upgraded and at least 60 brand new late block F-16s on top of it. Rendering of Block 70 F-16 on order for Bahrain. , Lockheed Martin From the first days of the Trump Administration, it was clear that the traditional walking of the fine line between being an ally to Taiwan and respecting America’s largest trading partner’s strategic concerns would be a thing of the past. Some have cheered this outright. Some have decried that not selling the same level of weaponry to Taiwanâ€”supposedly a major democratic ally in a turbulent regionâ€”that the U.S. offers to Pakistan is akin to straight-up appeasement. Others warn that such weapons deals do little more than inflame the delicate and complex geopolitical relationship between the U.S., China, and Taiwan.Â At the same time, China’s President Xi Jinping has made is crystal clear that reunification is not only China’s goal, but military force is on the table as a method to achieve that goal. These are ominous words for comparatively tiny Taiwan, an island country that is increasingly encircled by China’s growing military might with each passing day.Â Taiwan and the U.S. plan to hold talks late this summer about how to best push back against China’s mounting push for reunification, a move that has angered Beijing. At the same time, the U.S. has stepped up its own military displays of force in the region, with its warships making multiple high-profile transits through the Taiwan Strait.Â It will be very interesting to see how China reacts if the U.S. crosses their so-called red line and approves the F-16 sale, and how that act will impact the maelstrom of issues that currently hang over Chinese-U.S. relations.Â There is no doubt that such an order will come as great news to Lockheed’s newly relocated F-16 plant in South Carolina. The line had called Fort Worth home for decades, but it was down-scaled and moved recently in order to make room for F-35 production and to achieve new efficiencies based on reduced output. 60 jets will provide years of work for the new production facility, which is currently fulfilling an order for Bahrain .Â After the Obama Administration inked the deal for the upgraded F-16s and the election of Donald Trump, Taiwan had set its sights on acquiring the F-35, and the B model in particular. Its short takeoff and vertical landing capabilities fit Taiwan’s dispersed combat operations strategy during a major conflict when its air bases will be pummeled by Chinese ballistic and cruises missiles. But it was eventually decided the jets were too immature developmentally for Taiwan’s very pressing needs (they may have been all too right ) and they would be very costly to acquire and sustain, let alone the hurdle of getting the sale cleared through Washingon. So pushing for the latest and greatest F-16 models became Taipei’s focus once again. During an all-out conflict between Taiwan and China, many people question if any fighter aircraft type could really hold back the increasing might of the Chinese military. But others claim that leaving Taiwan without the weapons it needs to even have a shot of defending itself only invites Chinese aggression. With critical trade talks between the U.S. and China underway, we can’t underscore the negative timing of such a deal. Even if the Trump Administration were to approve the F-16 deal, one would think it could wait until after a trade deal is signed, or at least after some sort of preconceived internal deadline has passed.Â Then again, maybe the Trump Administration is dangling the possibility of an advanced F-16 sale to Taiwan as a lever to get Beijing to capitulate to certain trade demands that they haven’t been willing to agree to even after many months of negotiations. But if that were the case, it would look terrible and set an awful precedent if the F-16 deal was first tacitly agreed to and then denied after a trade deal with China was done. It would literally convey a clear message that the U.S. is willing to sell its friends down the river for trade deals. Taiwanese F-16A taxiing. , Toshiro Aoki/Wikicommons There may be another option that has been rumored in the past that may be far more possible now than beforeâ€”selling or leasing Taiwan surplus F-15C/D Eagles that have been upgraded with AESA radars. These aircraft do not have a robust air-to-ground capability and keeping it that way could be part of the export deal, but they are far more capable than even the latest F-16 in the air-to-air realm. Such an arrangement may provide the right mix of capabilities and less-than-new hardware to keep China from absolutely losing it. It would also uphold the 1979 law that states the U.S. can only sell Taiwan weapons “of a defensive character.” The F-15C/Ds can be upgraded with more air-to-air missile carriage capabilities and even conformal fuel tanks . This would provide Taiwan with a near ideal asset for swatting down large volumes of Chinese fighters, drones, and cruise missiles during a conflict while also being able to stay on station for hours at a time over the Taiwan Strait. In other words, with upgraded F-15C/Ds, Taiwan gets the most powerful air-to-air fighter radar in the world, persistence, and the magazine depth needed to at least make a dent when it comes to defending the island against a Chinese onslaught. F-15C., USAF Surplus F-15C/Ds are in limited supply and none have the new radars. But if the USAF gets its new F-15X fighters , selling some of the surplus F-15C/D models, along with a structural and technological upgrade , to Taiwan would make sense.Â Augmenting that purchase with surplus AV-8B Harriers from the Marine Corps, which can also be modified to carry modular AESA radars, would give Taiwan an aircraft that is proven, efficient, and extremely effective when it comes to highly dispersed combat operations. You can read more about the USMC’s soon to be surplus Harriers here .Â So, there may be additional potential options for Taiwan, some of which are more relevant now than ever.Â Regardless, it seems increasingly clear that the ‘more fighters for Taiwan’ issue is going to become a major news item in the weeks to come.Â Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 19, 2018",Behold Two Future “Marine One” VH-92 Helicopters Flying In Formation (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s amazing to think that the helicopters that will finally replace the VH-3D and VH-60N in the Marine One role will start flying in conjunction with that mission operationally by the end of this year. By 2023, the entire fleet of 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns will be replaced by 23 VH-92s, ending a long run by both helicopters in the prestigious role and especially by the Sea King based VH-3D . With its in-service date rapidly approaching and no major issues holding it back—at least according to official documentation —it makes sense that intense testing and training is underway around the Washington, D.C. area. This provided a great opportunity to aviation photographer Blend Qatipi who snapped beautiful photos of the soon to be Presidential helos as they flew over Potomac River. The photo of two in formation is the first like it we have seen. The photos give us amazingly clear views of the latest VH-92A configuration, which includes one major new addition. A new satellite communications dome has been added to the upper tail-boom area ahead of the one that already existed. This installation is likely in line with what we have seen on the rest of the Presidential and National Command Authority’s aircraft, among others in the U.S. military. In addition to older MILSTAR and UHF satellites communications, new wide-band global SATCOM capabilities are being added to give aircraft super-secure high-speed connectivity virtually anywhere in the world. You can read all about this system and the aircraft it is showing up on in this past piece of ours . It’s also worth noting that we have seen other major satellite connectivity improvements to Presidential transport capabilities recently, including a massive new command and communications vehicle that sports a big SATCOM array being added to the Secret Service’s motorcade fleet. Blend Qatipi An array of other antennas also populates the aircraft’s skin. These include a high-frequency railing-like array on the tail boom for long-range radio communications, as well as a platter array on the bottom of the aircraft usually associated with air-to-ground mobile phone network calling capabilities. Beyond that, all the systems you would expect on Marine One are present. These include laser-based directional infrared countermeasures , which you can read all about in this past piece of ours about the rapidly evolving VH-92. The small missile launch detectors that cue this system and the helicopter’s overall self-protection suite can be seen mounted on the helicopters sponsons just below the “United States Of America” title. Blend Qatipi You can also see a discreet countermeasures dispenser bucket mounted near the rear of the fuselage. These can be filled with expendable decoys—flares and possibly chaff —when operating in especially high-threat areas. When the aircraft becoming operational, they will be located at HMX-1’s base in Quantico , Virginia and will also stand alert, ready to whisk the President away to safety at a moment’s notice, at Naval Support Facility Ancostia in Washington, D.C. With this in mind, testing and training around the D.C. area is key. Most notably, we were first to report on the VH-92 undergoing landing and takeoff testing on the White House’s South Lawn fairly recently. This test event also resulted in spectacular images . Also, NAS Patuxent River, the Navy’s primary aircraft test base where the VH-92 program is located, is just 50 miles away from Washington, D.C. So, with all this in mind, suffice it to say that we will be seeing a lot more of the VH-92s in the area as the type dashes towards initial operating capability (IOC). Eventually the type will become a fixture of the area skyline, just like other Marine One helicopters that came before it. Considering Marine One helicopters always operate in pairs for Presidential airlift missions—one acting as a decoy in a constantly morphing aerial shell-game—the banner shot on this page will become an iconic visual in the years to come. Author’s note: A huge thanks to Blend Qatipi for sharing is wonderful photos with us. Make sure to check out his photos over on Flickr , he really has the Washington, D.C. area covered when it comes to taking pics of all the cool airplanes that come and go from the region. Update: 10:45pm PDT— Some of our sharp-eyed readers pointed out that the two paint schemes differ slightly and they are very much right. The front helicopter has the American flag on the engine cowling and the white paint moves around the forward part of the engine exhaust. The United States Of America title is also smaller in size on the sponson. The rear aircraft has the traditional turbine intake warning chevron in red where the flag was on the lead helicopter and the flag has been moved to in front of the intake. Black paint totally surrounds the engine exhaust, too. The United States Of America title is also larger and fills out more of the sponson’s flat side area. I would guess that the rear aircraft’s paint job is more representative of the final scheme, but we don’t know for sure. The operational aircraft all have to match in every way as there can be no way to tell them apart visually or the decoy concept of operations would be degraded or even useless.

You can read all about the V-280 Valor in this past feature of ours . Dan Spoor, Vice President, Sikorsky Future Vertical Lift stated the following in a press release: “Defiant is designed to fly at nearly twice the speed and has twice the range of conventional helicopters while retaining the very best, if not better low-speed and hover performance of conventional helicopters… This design provides for exceptional performance in the objective area, where potential enemy activity places a premium on maneuverability, survivability and flexibility. We are thrilled with the results of today’s flight and look forward to an exciting flight test program.” Defiant is a further extrapolation of Sikorsky’s X2 technology demonstrator , which pioneered its unique configuration. The S-97 Raider , an armed reconnaissance coaxial rotor compound helicopter that the company also derived from the X2 concept and has helped further inform the development of the SB>1, has been flying for years now and two prototypes are currently in testing. Lockheed Martin has since purchased Sikorsky, but it continues to operate under that name and as a separate business unit. The Defiant and the Valor are set to go head to head as part of the Army’s Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program. The service had hoped to begin these flight tests in December 2017, but pushed its timeline back due to the delays with the SB>1. The Army plans to use the results from JMR to help better understand and define the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program requirements. The SB>1 and V-280,  or refined versions of these designs, will be heading for a brawl over the “medium” portion of that project, which aims to replace hundreds of UH-60 Black Hawks and AH-64 Apaches . The Sikorsky-Boeing team plans to pitch the Defiant as a successor to the Black Hawks and has shown a companion gunship design as the Apache replacement. A chart showing the evolution of Sikorsky’s advanced compound helicopters leading to the  SB>1, which could lead to a refined design for the FVL competition. It also shows a possible contender for FVL’s “light” segment derived from the S-97 Raider., Lockheed Martin The Sikorsky-Boeing Team had previously hoped to have the helicopter flying in December 2018, but had to push the date back due to unknown issues with the drivetrain testbed. At that time, the first flight was already around a year behind schedule . At the end of January 2019, Lockheed Martin, on behalf of Sikorsky, did release a video showing the Defiant conducting a ground run in the lead up to its first flight. At present, the Army hopes to have its final Black Hawk replacement in service around 2030. Now, with both the V-280 and the SB>1 flying, the competition for who will end up dominating the lucrative medium-lift helicopter category within the DoD in the decades to come will rapidly heat up. Other contenders exist , as well , and there may very well up being room for multiple types to satisfy the blanket requirement. But with mature tilt-rotor technology now being directly challenged, there is more on the line, including potential sales to the other services, exports to foreign militaries, and the potentially vast commercial and private market, as well. In other words, a lot is riding on the rotors of these prototypes. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2018",Army Tanks And Other Vehicles Get New Paint Jobs To Help Hide From Thermal Optics,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army says it has developed a new type of paint for its M1 Abrams tanks and other armored vehicles that can help reduce their infrared signature and make the harder to detect. The coating is also a general improvement over what the service uses now and could have applications well beyond ground vehicles. The Army’s Ground Vehicle Systems Center, the Army Research Laboratory, and the service’s Manufacturing Technology (ManTech) program worked to develop what is officially known as the Ground Vehicle Coating System (GVCS), according to an official news item on Mar. 20, 2019 . The paint itself is known as “TALON,” but there is no definition available yet for what this acronym stands for. We don’t know how the coating works exactly, but it would have to lessen the absorption of thermal energy from a vehicle’s heat-generating internal components, such as engines, auxiliary power units, and electronics. Modern armored vehicles, especially tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, have required steadily more significant amounts of power to support ever-improving sensors, communications systems, and other systems, which only increases their thermal signature. Heat builds up in places, such as the suspension and tracks, from normal operation, too, as well as just sitting out in the sun. This capture from a thermal camera of a Soviet-era 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled howitzer offers a good example of an armored vehicle’s basic thermal signature. This vehicle has a front-mounted engine, but the heat radiates out from there. The tracks and suspension also build up heat as the vehicle moves. Additional electronics and additional systems only increase this signature., CI Systems This has increased the risk that an opponent with thermal or infrared imaging systems will be able to detect those vehicles faster and at greater distances and then engage or avoid them. These types of optics are increasingly part of the fire control systems on vehicles and man-portable weapon systems, such as anti-tank guided missiles . Beyond the threat of detection, these thermal signatures also offer something for various guided weapons to home in on. Reducing the heat a vehicle gives off, could make it more difficult for a missile or a bomb with an imaging infrared seeker to spot it and lock on. At the same time, while the U.S. military has historically had an edge in optics that can exploit these heat signatures, especially after dark, this qualitative advantage is steadily eroding . This isn’t limited to developments among “great power” competitors, such as Russia and China, or small nation states, such as Iran, either. Non-state actors increasingly have access to thermal and night vision systems that, while not examples of the latest generations of the technology, offer a significant boost in their capabilities. Technology advances and miniaturization are making infrared sensors smaller and cheaper all the time and the technology is much more widespread and accessible than it has been in the past. The affordability of Small drones capable of carrying infrared cameras is a particularly notable example of how far things have come in this realm. Power generation requirements for armored and other ground vehicles are only set to increase in the future, which will require even more efforts to conceal their thermal signatures. The GVCS paint jobs are only one part of a broader effort to address these threats, according to the Army. So far, the Army has applied the new paint on M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles on a test basis. Pictures the service released of vehicles with the coating included one showing a prototype of the latest M1 variant, M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3 tank, or M1A2 SEPv3, which is also known as the M1A2C. The tank in question also appeared to have part of a new armor package on its turret, or a surrogate weight representing future added armor, a configuration that first publicly emerged in February 2019 . An M1A2 SEPv3 tank the Army says has the new paint job. The racks on the side of the hull and turret are for an explosive reactive armor package this isn’t installed., US Army The service says the new paint also simply offers important improvements over the existing Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) it uses now. As its name implies, CARC’s major improvement over previous paints was its ability to limit the absorption of chemical and biological agents, especially liquids, to speed up the process of decontamination after an attack. TALON has the same general attributes and personnel can apply it using existing facilities and equipment they use to apply CARC. Over the course of development, the Army says it was able to reduce the cost of the new coating per gallon by 75 percent. A Bradley Fighting Vehicle sits after having recieving the new coating., US Army “Working with industry allowed for quicker implementation of manufacturing techniques, which enabled the product to be produced on a larger scale,” Thomas Wagner, an engineer at the Ground Vehicle Systems Center, said in an official interview . “Concurrent Technologies Corporation’s long history of taking engineered products and optimizing designs and processes to reduce per unit prices will allow the Army to gain an advantage that it otherwise may not have.” There’s no word yet on whether TALON is any safer than CARC, which contains chemicals that are so hazardous that it requires specialized paint houses and time-consuming application procedures. Many of the chemical components are so toxic that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has a page dedicated to handling claims of potential exposure to CARC during the painting and curing process, as well as during certain maintenance tasks. Prolonged exposure to the mixture can result in respiratory problems, such as chronic asthma, as well as kidney damage. The Army also sees TALON, which already comes in a number of different colors, as having joint-service applications. The new coating would offer the same benefits to ground vehicles across the U.S. military, many of which are experiencing the same growth in systems that increase their heat signature. The applications wouldn’t necessarily be limited to land-based systems, either. In 2018, the Army says it provided U.S. Special Operations Command with a gray version specifically for the U.S. Navy’s stealthy special operations boats . These craft, which The War Zone has profiled in detail in the past, are also constantly adding to their thermal signature with new systems. Infrared signature control on boats is especially important as they operate against a cool, consistent background. US Navy special operations forces ride in a Combatant Craft Assault (CCA), in front, and Combatant Craft Medium (CCM) during a training exercise., USN CARC is also already in use on Army helicopters and a heat reducing variant could be especially valuable in that context given the increasing proliferation of short-range, heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles , including man-portable types . The service is already in the process of adding directional infrared countermeasures to its rotorcraft, including the AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook , to mitigate these threats. Other rotorcraft fleets across the U.S. military are facing the same threat environment. Right now, the Army is planning to apply the new coating across it fleets of M1 tanks, Bradley Fighting vehicles, and Stryker wheeled armored vehicles . The service’s goal is to have the first unit fully equipped with vehicles covered in the new paint by 2021, but it didn’t say what the specific vehicle would be. Given that the Army will be able to use its existing painting infrastructure to apply TALON, and the obvious utility of the new paint, this schedule could very well end up accelerated. It’s certainly a relatively simple addition to the service’s tank and other vehicle fleets that could have an outsized impact keeping those vehicles hidden during future operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 27, 2018",Marines To Finally Add 30mm Cannon To Bolt-On “Harvest Hawk” Armament Kits For KC-130Js,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps plans to finally add a 30mm cannon to the bolt-on Harvest Hawk armament kit for its KC-130J Hercules aircraft starting in Fiscal Year 2023. At present, the add-on weapon system can only employ AGM-114 Hellfire and AGM-176 Griffin precision-guided missiles, as well as GBU-44/A Viper Strike glide bombs. The details about the Harvest Hawk’s new gun were included in descriptions of the U.S. Navy’s budget proposal for the 2020 Fiscal Year , which it released on Mar. 18, 2019. The Navy and the Marines share a common budget. As it stands now, the Marines will ask for more than $6 million to purchase two 30mm guns, associated mounts and other equipment, and support and services in the 2023 fiscal cycle as part of the ongoing upgrade of the Harvest Hawk system to the new Harvest Hawk Plus (HH+) standard. The service then expects to spend more than $13 million to buy six more, plus additional associated items, in the next fiscal year. Beyond new weapons, HH+ will also feature updated sensors, an added electronic warfare capability , and overall improvements that will make it simpler and cheaper to install, operate, and maintain. The budget documents do not say what specific gun the Marines are planning to buy, but when they first announced the Harvest Hawk kit in 2009, the plan included the eventual addition of the 30mm Bushmaster II automatic cannon. Two years earlier, the U.S. Air Force had modified a small number of its dedicated AC-130U Spooky gunships to each carry two of the Mk 44 variants of these guns. The Navy was already purchasing the Mk 44 as the main armament for the Marine Corps’ abortive amphibious Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). The service has since begun using these weapons as a close-in defense system on its ships, including the first-in-class USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer. A modified AC-130U with two 30mm Mk 44 Bushmaster II cannons., USAF The Bushmaster II remains the most obvious option. Though the Air Force did not decide to refit its AC-130Us with the new guns, and eventually returned the modified aircraft to their original configuration, it has since added the GAU-23/A variant of this cannon to its AC-130W Stinger II and AC-130J Ghostrider gunships. There is also now a special 30mm round for this gun, optimized for performance from an aerial platform. A Harvest Hawk kit that includes a Bushmaster II firing this ammunition would offer important added capability to conduct extremely focused strikes on enemy targets that might be in very close proximity to friendly forces, also known as “ danger close ,” or situated near innocent civilians. Especially in dense urban environments, it may be too risky to use even small missiles or bombs . Guns can also provide a greater volume of fire rapidly on a specific target and can more readily shift focus from one target to another compared to precision guided weapons. Automatic cannons also offer greater magazine depth, as well, and the shells they fire are significantly cheaper than a missile or bomb. The Air Force had similarly though it might be possible to increasingly move away from guns on its AC-130Ws and AC-130Js in favor of precision guided munitions, but has since reversed course . Adding the gun to the Harvest Hawk kit will require a different mounting arrangement from either of those Air Force gunships, which both have the cannon fixed in position sticking out the left side of the forward fuselage. An AC-130J’s 30mm GAU-23/A Bushmaster II cannon., USAF However, the Harvest Hawk kit is supposed to be relatively easy to install and remove on any Marine KC-130J, giving the service the option to quickly weaponize any of these aircraft as necessary, which will require a temporary mount. The installation process at present involves, among other things, adding a roll-on/roll-off operators station and a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser designator, under the nose. Marines load Harvest Hawk’s roll-on/roll-off operator station onto a KC-130J., USMC The easiest option for the Marines would be to install the gun in the rear left-hand paratrooper door – a particularly versatile spot on C-130-series aircraft. Lockheed Martin actually already offers exactly this setup as part of export-ready configuration known as the C-130J-Special Operations Forces, or C-130J-SOF , which the company unveiled in 2017. An artist’s rendering of the C-130J-SOF configuration, featuring a 30mm cannon installed in the rear left-hand paratrooper door., Lockheed Martin Putting the gun in the paratrooper door would prevent the Harvest Hawk kit from using that position to launch missiles or glide bombs, as it had done in the past. The armament package would still have a separate launcher mounted on the rear ramp and allow the KC-130Js to carry additional weapons under wing. The Marines will also have to ensure whatever mount it chooses provides a stable and accurate firing platform for the cannon. The Air Force had abandoned the idea of installing the Bushmaster II on the AC-130U back in the late 2000s due to accuracy concerns and this appeared to have influenced the Marine Corps’ decision, at least in part, to hold off on adding the gun to the Harvest Hawk kit for more than a decade. A KC-130J equipped with an earlier version of the Harvest Hawk system. Not the two ejection slots for precision guided munitions in the left-hand paratrooper door. The podded sensor turret under the left wing has also given way to one under the nose., Lockheed Martin The AC-130W apparently escaped these issues, but both it and the J model still have fixed, permanent gun mounts that the Harvest Hawk kit will not utilize. More recently, testing highlighted new and significant concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the Bushmaster II installation of the Ghostrider, too. But the Air Force has since largely resolved those problems on the AC-130J, according to the most recent annual report on the progress of the Ghostrider program from the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which covers developments during the 2018 Fiscal Year and came out in January 2019. Improvements to the gun’s fire control system, better training for gunners, and a revised policy to replace the weapon’s barrel after every 15,000 rounds have reportedly improved the Ghostrider’s accuracy with its 30mm cannon significantly. Again, the experience with the AC-130W and J won’t be totally applicable to Harvest Hawk, but years of the Air Force fiddling with the 30mm cannon installation on those gunships can only help inform the Marines efforts to add the same weapon to their bolt-on kit. The Air Force’s change of heart on guns for its gunships in general only underscores how valuable this category of weapons remains for these types of aircraft, something that can’t have been lost on the Marine Corps, as well. So, a decade after the Marine Corps first unveiled the Harvest Hawk concept, the path finally looks clear for the service to give the kits the guns that it had promised were coming from the very beginning.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 1, 2019",Air Controller Wowed By Pilot’s Ability To See Mystery Object Over Las Vegas With Night Vision (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Around 9pm local time on Saturday, March 16th, 2019, an air ambulance helicopter was flying roughly 15 miles west of central Last Vegas when something odd caught his aided eye. During an exchange with an air traffic controller, the pilot of Mercy Air 21, an Agusta 119 Koala helicopter, noted spotting an unidentified object some distance from his position and only he was likely able to see it in the darkness as he was wearing night vision goggles (NVGs). The controller responded that he had nothing on radar in the area where he was seeing the object, but when he heard the pilot could only see it through his NVGs, he responded with amazement. Our good friend @Aircraftspots mentioned the odd exchange on twitter and posted the audio to Soundcloud , which you can listen to in full below. Apparently, he was tipped off to it by fellow Twitter user and aviation aficionado @ KE6ZGP . https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Faircraftspots%2Flas-vegas-ufo You can hear the pilot alert the controller to spotting something over the “Southern Hills area.” This is not a topographic landmark, it is a hospital in the southwest corner of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. He notes that the objects appears to be at around 7,000 feet and that it could be a balloon or “something along those lines” and that it is unlit. An A119 Koala like the one involved in the radio exchange. , Air Methods Facebook Page The controller responds saying he doesn’t see it, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t something out there. The pilot then informs him that he has night vision goggles on and that he can only see it through the goggles. The controller seems pretty amazed with the pilot’s capabilities, responding “oooh that’s awesome .” The red arrow is the location of South Hills Hospital and the red outlined area is a window roughly 15 miles west of McCarran International Airport. Our best guess on where the helicopter was that spotted the object. , Google Earth We ran back the tracking data Flightradar24 had during the time of the radio exchange and we couldn’t find anything unusual in the area where the pilot saw the object and we couldn’t find Mercy Air 21 definitively either. This isn’t surprising as lower-flying aircraft have spotty tracking in that area. We did find an air ambulance helicopter that briefly appeared over the western Las Vegas metropolitan area at around the right time of the radio call. According to @Aircraftspots, that aircraft, N608CF, doesn’t historically use the Mercy Air 21 callsign. Still, it is the same type as the one that does and appears to be owned by the same company— Air Methods . So it is possible that this was the helicopter communicating with air traffic control, although its position is closer to the center of Las Vegas than it should be, at least based on the positioning call given by the air traffic controller in the recorded audio. N608CF, a A119 owned by Air Methods Corp, appeared just for a moment over West Las Vegas around the time of the radio call. , Flightradar24 Really, all that doesn’t matter that much. What we are left with here is an interesting piece of air traffic control audio more than an unexplained sighting of a pressing or extremely extraordinary nature. As the pilot notes, it could have been some sort of a balloon, but it does seem a bit odd spotting an unlit balloon at night, with night vision goggles, from miles away. The altitude is also interesting, 7,000 feet isn’t exactly low. But without more information and/or additional witnesses, we don’t have much to warrant further investigation. At least not yet. We have reached out to Air Methods to see if the pilot can give us any more info on the incident. UPDATE: 6:30pm PST— There was a bit of confusion about the time indexing between the flight data and the audio clip and our friend @thenewarea51 figure it out . Because it was UTC time, we were a day behind, so the data we wanted to see was on the 17th not 16th of March. When we reviewed the correct data from Flightradar24, we got Mercy Air 21 (MA021) exactly where it should be, roughly 15 miles west of KLAS in the red box I originally outlined. We can also positively ID the helicopter. It is an Agusta A109, registered N238AM , belonging to Air Methods. We also now have better positioning information. According to this, MA021 would have been roughly nine miles from the South Hills Hospital, the approximate area where the pilot thought the object was flying over at 7,000 feet, when the radio exchange occurred. A nine mile visual ID of a party ballon or something like that at night using NVGs seems really questionable. So size of the object and its exact configuration is the big question at this point. We also know that the A109 was flying at 7,000 feet. So, the pilot would have seen this object at eye level from his perspective. Flightradar24 Update: March 18th, 2019 @ 6:19pm PST— We finally talked to the Mercy Air operations base where the helicopter flies out of and they informed us that Air Methods headquarters has told them not provide comment or access to the pilot who was talking on the radio and spotted the object. They told us Air Methods wants any inquiries sent to their headquarters. The problem is that I had reached out to them and have heard nothing back in well over 24 hours. I will keep trying to contact them directly, but at this point it looks as if they are actively trying to avoid discussing the event with us. Update: March 20th, 2019 @ 8pm PST— It took a few days, but we finally got comment from Air Methods. Here is what their director of communications sent me: Hi Tyler – The pilot believes that the object in question were Mylar balloons.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",Navy To Supersize Its Ultra Versatile SM-6 Missile For Even Longer Range And Higher Speed,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s SM-6 missile has become an all-star of multi-role capability and a shining example of how repackaging existing systems with some new tech can garner grand results. The missile can shoot down air-breathing threats like aircraft and cruise missiles, it can swat incoming ballistic missiles in the terminal phases of flight, it can attack sea targets, and it even has a latent land attack potential. It is also network enabled and can engage targets well beyond the sensor reach of its launch platform using telemetry data-linked from a third-party platform, like a jet fighter. It does all this over long ranges, reaching out over 150 miles from its vertical launch cell aboard American destroyers and cruisers. Now, according to 2020 budget request documents, this versatile missile is set to get upsized for considerably more range and speed, and that is a very big deal. The SM-6 was originally designed to leverage existing components, most notably the airframe of the SM-2ER Block IV Standard Missile and the seeker from an AIM-120C AMRAAM air-to-air missile . It has quickly evolved to be more potent and flexible since its introduction into service in 2013. Now, the latest SM-6 derivative is slated to shed its legacy airframe, one which doesn’t take advantage of the full diameter of the launch cells in the Navy’s Mk41 vertical launch systems, and be redesigned with a 21 inch diameter motor that will substantially increase the type’s range and speed. A Standard Missile-6 is loaded into a specialized container at the Raytheon Redstone Missile Integration Facility for delivery to the U.S. Navy., Raytheon This same approach was taken with the SM-3 anti-ballistic missile interceptor, which is used for mid-course intercepts of ballistic missile threats. That missile also evolved from the SM-2ER Block IV, but as a joint U.S.-Japan weapons program venture. The SM-3 Block IIA is a redesigned variant that uses a 21 inch motor for increased range, higher speed, and thus greatly improved capability overall. Part of the redesign also included decreasing the size and reconfiguring the missile’s tail fins, and drastically decreasing the size of the airframe strakes, so that it can still fit its wider diameter frame into the confines Mk41 cell. MDA SM-3 Block IIA’s wider and less cluttered airframe. , Raytheon We had proposed that the SM-3 Block IIA’s redesign be carried over to the SM-6 in a past article of ours , which now seems to be the case according to the Pentagon’s proposed 2020 budget. Known as the SM-6 Block IB, the initiative looks to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over next four years to develop the more capable missile. The line-item description, posted below, makes special note of the fact that the program will leverage existing missile technology and will result in an SM-6 with increased range. It will use a 21 inch diameter motor like the SM-3 Block IIA and will leverage internal components from the SM-6 Block IA. This will likely leave the upper seeker-warhead section of the missile the same diameter that it currently is, with the larger 21 inch motor attached below. As such, it will have a “necked-down” rifle bullet like appearance. DOD DOD The documents state the SM-6 Block IB is planned to make it through its primary development by 2024. DOD By the end of this development process, the Navy will have all of its DDG-1000 Zumwalt class destroyers operational , ships which could really use such a versatile weapon for multiple applications and especially to overcome its radar/combat suite’s deficiencies. Equipping the stealthy ships with SM-6 would also vibe with the Navy’s revamped vision for them . The first FFG(X) frigates will also be delivered. The FFG(X)s aren’t officially slated to receive the SM-6 at this time, but such a versatile weapon could give the small surface combatants immense reach and a heavy punch. This is also when the Navy will be introducing its first Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers —the latest in the class of multi-role surface combatants that the SM-6 was primarily designed for. The Navy’s new drone ship initiative —which will include vessels equipped with Mk 41 vertical launch systems—will be well underway by then, as well. They represent what is really the most exciting aspect of the SM-6, and especially a longer-range version of it. It’s a networked-enabled weapon that can use third party targeting—such as that from aircraft, ships, satellites, and land-based sensors—to engage enemies over very long distances. In other words, it doesn’t really matter what the launch platform is, or to some degree where it is, in order to be employed successfully. For instance, if a Super Hornet’s air-to-air missile stores run dry, an SM-6 could be launched from a ship a hundred miles away at an aerial target that is in the shadow of the ship’s radar horizon or even beyond its detection range as a whole. It would use the Super Hornet’s targeting data to get within range on its own active radar seeker. Once it is locked on organically, the target has a very low chance of survival. Remote launch and engagement using an SM-6 guided by third party sensors—an F-35—has already been tested successfully using the Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) networking concept., Lockheed Martin So even if an FFG(X) doesn’t have the radar capable or targeting threats at the ranges a SM-6 Block IB could reach, it could simply act as the remote launch platform if it is closest to the target and is equipped with the missile. The same can be said for pretty much any ship with a vertical launch system capable of firing the missile, such as a drone ship. But here is the thing, by most indications, the SM-6 Block IB would be a multi-function missile like the Block IA, yet in some past documentation, the Block IB was highlighted as a long-range anti-ship ballistic missile, above all else. We don’t have a range increase for the new missile design, but let’s just throw out a number of 30 percent. That would take the missile’s range up to roughly 200 miles, but that’s based on an anti-air engagement. It would be longer in a surface-to-surface one. And this is a very conservative guess based on the reported basic range metric that we are told drastically undervalues the original SM-6’s baseline capabilities. It could be as much as double the range under certain engagement profiles, we just don’t know. Being able to reach out and pummel ships with a high-speed ballistic missile from over 200 miles away would be an incredible capability to insert into the U.S. Navy’s surface combatant force. Many potential enemy vessels are equipped to counter air-breathing threats, such as anti-ship cruise missiles and low-flying fighters—but not anti-ship ballistic missiles. Layering these weapons in with anti-ship cruise missiles, such as Block IV Tactical Tomahawks , Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs) , and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), and even the ever more lethal Harpoon anti-ship missile for shorter-ranged engagements, during an attack on a hostile flotilla would give even the most well equipped naval force a run for their money defending against it. Even AEGIS class destroyers and cruisers, at least up until very recently, can’t execute the ballistic missile defense and anti-air mission at the same time. USN Hopefully, the SM-6 Block IB will also include its anti-air and localized ballistic missile defense functions as well, at least eventually. Maybe even the weapon’s latent land attack capability will be more of a priority in the future considering the weapon’s greater range. The line item in the budget seems to indicated that it will indeed be multi-role. I think it’s also time for the Pentagon to begin working on adapting the SM-6 for air-launch applications. It could become the long-range multi-purpose weapon of choice for the Navy and the Air Force. Not only could it take down enemy aircraft at hundreds of miles away—something the USAF is highly interested in out of necessity— but it could also blast ships and even incoming ballistic missiles at similarly long ranges with the help of being launched at altitude and high-speed. The land attack potential is also key here. Not only could it hit fixed targets, but if the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile’s (AARGM) multi-mode seeker was incorporated, it could go after key air defense components from very long ranges. An air-launched version could be carried by strategic bomber and medium-large fighter alike, from B-21 to the F/A-18E/F to the F-15. But having what amounts to a very long-range SEAD weapon forward deployed on ships would also be a big force multiplier for air components of an integrated combat force. And once again, it could use the geolocation data of threatening emitters sniffed up by aircraft like the F-35 for targeting at very long distances. There is also the possibility that SM-6 could be adapted for submarine use. We have talked about this in the past , but we don’t have any evidence that points to such a program existing beyond speculation. Regardless, the SM-6 was already among the Navy’s most promising and exciting weapons programs. Now that it is getting supersized to meet its maximum potential, its value will only become more undeniable and hopefully we will see it ported over onto multiple future naval platforms, and maybe even aerial ones, in the future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 18, 2019",The Navy’s “Operational” F-35C Is Fully Mission Capable Less Than Five Percent Of The Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Newly available data shows that less than 15 percent of the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Joint Strike Fighters and around just two percent of the U.S. Navy’s F-35Cs were fully mission capable at any given time, on average, for more than two years at least. The details come as the readiness rates for aviation fleets across both services have plummeted in recent years. It is also a clear indication that they will have a difficult time meeting the target of 80 percent mission capability rates for both aircraft by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year that former Secretary of Defense James Mattis had mandated last year. The Project on Government Oversight (POGO) first revealed the chronically abysmal mission capable rates for the F-35B and C models on Mar. 19, 2019, after obtaining official Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) data spanning from October 2016 to December 2018. The Navy only declared initial operational capability (IOC) with the F-35C, meant to reflect the service’s establishment of its first operational unit, at the end of February 2019 . However, the Marines had announced they had reached IOC with the F-35B back in July 2015 . F-35Bs from the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron Two One One (VMFA-211) also recently wrapped up a deployment to the Horn of Africa and the Middle East that involved the first ever combat missions by American F-35s, with the planes eventually striking targets in Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria . “In response to POGO’s questions about the Navy’s fully mission capable rates, the Joint Program Office highlighted the entire F-35 fleet’s higher “mission capable” rate,” Dan Grazier, the Jack Shanahan Military Fellow at the Center for Defense Information at POGO, wrote in a detailed status update on the F-35 program as a whole on the organization’s website. This is “a less rigorous – and less useful – measure showing how often the aircraft can perform at least one of its assigned tasks. The office also identified the lack of spare parts as the biggest factor impacting availability.” The data that POGO obtained on full mission capable F-35Bs and Cs, also commonly known as “Code One” aircraft, is truly striking. The average number of fully mission capable Marine F-35Bs, aircraft with all of their systems functional and capable of meeting all mission requirements, never rose above 25 percent in more than two years. In October 2017, it dipped to 12.9 percent and by the end of 2018 it was hovering somewhere around 12 to 13 percent. NAVAIR via POGO NAVAIR via POGO As of June 2018 , Lockheed Martin had delivered 75 F-35Bs to all customers, the vast majority of which went to the Marines. Even if the service had received all of these planes, it would have had less than dozen jets fully mission ready in December 2018, more than three years after officially declaring the type operational. The figures for the F-35C are far worse. For more than two years, the Navy has been unable to even get the full mission capable rate about 20 percent. As of December 2017, not a single one of the service’s jets met that standard at any given time. A year later, the rate was still in the single digits. With just 28 C models in total, this would have meant just around one of the stealthy aircraft was ever fully ready to go, on average, for at least 12 months. There’s absolutely no reason to doubt the accuracy or authenticity of this data. In 2017 , the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report that noted that the F-35B full mission capable rate was under 15 percent. GAO Though NAVAIR might prefer to refer to the mission capable rate, which is really a partially mission capable rate, it’s not actually much better, either. The F-35B mission capable rate has generally been between 40 and 50 percent. With the exception of an unexplained spike to 70 percent mission capable in August 2018, the F-35C fleet’s readiness has been steadily trending downward to below 50 percent. It’s certainly fair for NAVAIR to blame a part of this dismal performance on parts shortages and other chronic sustainment issues. The Pentagon’s central F-35 Joint Program Office, together with the plane’s manufacturer Lockheed Martin, have been struggling to get these problems , and their associated costs , under control for years now. The unit costs for all three F-35 variants have been coming down, but at the same time, operation and maintenance costs have steadily grown . On top of that, the F-35’s cloud-based computer brain, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), pronounced like the name “Alice,” has failed to perform. In principle, this system is supposed to streamline mission planning and maintenance procedures, help diagnose and predict faults, and serve a host of other critical mission functions that you can read about in more detail here . In practice, ALIS has contributed to dramatic declines in mission capable rates for various reasons, including by declaring parts broken when they’re not and showing aircraft as not mission capable when they actually are . A US Air Force maintainer uses a laptop to communicate with ALIS on an F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., USAF “The timeline for correcting ALIS deficiencies is typically excessive, causing workarounds to remain in place for extended periods,” the Pentagon’s Office of the Direction of Operational Test and Evaluation, or DOT&E, noted in its annual report on the F-35 program’s performance for the 2018 Fiscal Year. “For example, ALIS incorrectly reports the status of aircraft as NMC [Not Mission Capable] in the Squadron Health Management application based on HRCs [Health Reporting Codes] (faults). Meanwhile, a separate application – Customer Maintenance Management System, which relies on the Mission Essential Function List (MEFL) – reports the same aircraft as mission capable.” It’s also important to note that the U.S. military exacerbated these issues itself through a concept known as concurrency , which involved increasing F-35 production and purchasing dozens of jets with plans to make upgrades and updates on a rolling basis as time went on. Originally billed as a cost-saving measure, this has left the Navy and Marines with dozens of jets in various configurations that do not all have the same capabilities and routinely have to go back to the depot for reworks. Aircraft with older mission systems software , in particular, have become increasingly difficult to maintain and add to the errors in ALIS. It may never be cost-effective to bring these F-35s up to the latest standards . A basic overview of the different mission system software blocks as of February 2018. There have been numerous revisions in each case, as well, meaning that there have actually been dozens of different configurations., GAO These issues are hardly limited to the F-35B and C models, either. The U.S. Air Force has been experiencing them as well with regards to its F-35A fleet, which had a full mission capable rate of just more than 32 percent as of mid-2017, according to the GAO. This service has also been choosing to use the less comprehensive mission capable rate instead in much of its public reporting, which inflated the readiness figure for that year to closer to 55 percent. All three services had been referring to a separate Mission Effectiveness figure, as well, which indicates the percentage of time an F-35 could perform its assigned mission. There’s no information on whether or not the actual readiness rates, whether full mission capable or partial mission capable, impacted the decision to assign a mission in the first place, though. A chart showing various readiness data on Air Force F-35As and Marine Corps F-35Bs during 2016 and 2017., GAO Earlier in March 2019, Defense News revealed that ALIS has been so unreliable that the U.S. Air Force’s instructor and student pilots at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and Luke Air Force Base in Arizona quietly stopped using it altogether in early 2018. The month before, that service had announced it had begun an initiative dubbed Mad Hatter, to completely revamp the system. “The goal [of Mad Hatter] is not simply to fix ALIS within the constraints that define it,” Will Roper, the Air Force’s top acquisition official, told Defense News, in February 2018. “It is to make the operator – the maintainer – more efficient, to make their user experience more pleasant.” F-35Cs in the hangar bay of a supercarrier. , USN Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson was blunt about the system in remarks at the Air Force Association’s Air Warfare Symposium that same month. “I can guarantee that no Air Force maintainer will ever name their daughter Alice,” she quipped. But it’s hard to see sustainment costs, parts shortages, ALIS, and even concurrency, being the only factors to blame. For the F-35C fleet especially, a relatively small force tasked with testing and training duties for the entire reporting period that the data POGO obtained covers, it seems difficult to understand how readiness could slip so low. There would have been a particular incentive to ensure the fleet was performing as well as possible in the lead up to the IOC declaration. F-35B in vertical landing mode. , USNC Whatever the exact causes, and while the F-35B and C mission capable rates are especially awful, they also reflect broader and more serious trends across Navy and Marine aviation communities. At the beginning of 2018, the Navy’s overall full mission capable rate goal across the entire Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE), which includes Marine aircraft and helicopters , was just 56 percent. Even then, at that time, the actual “enterprise-wide” rate was closer to 30 percent. The desired overall mission capable rate, which the services were also failing to meet, was 73 percent. Both figures had been largely trending downward every year since 1998. A change in how NAVAIR determined support postures briefly led to the average full mission capable rate for any Navy or Marine aircraft or helicopter dropping to just 15 percent. In 2010, the Navy and Marines began also using a Ready Basic Aircraft category, or RBA, something one official presentation even refers to as a “ lowered bar ,” to refer to planes and helicopters that were available in any way, to further help present a more positive picture of their readiness. A chart showing mission capable and full mission capable rates across the entire Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) from August 1998 to August 2017., USN A host of factors since the end of the Cold War are responsible for this overall decline. The Budget Control Act of 2011, which triggered automatic defense spending cuts in 2013, known as sequestration, only exacerbated the issue, forcing the services to make hard choices about what to scale back to meet the budgetary constraints. Poor decision making throughout the U.S. military compounded the problems as various services, with new procurement repeatedly taking precedence over training, maintenance, logistics, and overall readiness. In recent years, the impacts have risen to crisis levels amid a spate of often fatal accidents. It’s also what prompted then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis to demand in a memo he circulated in September 2018 that the Navy, Marines, and Air Force all ensure that certain “critical aviation platforms,” including all three models of the F-35, had mission capable rates at or above 80 percent by the end of the 2019 Fiscal Year. It will take a nearly miracle-like improvement in performance for any of the F-35 fleets to meet this target by the Sept. 30, 2019 deadline, even using the less robust mission capable rate rather than the full mission capable rate. Ongoing sustainment problems and troubles with ALIS raise the possibility that it might actually get worse. From left to right, the F-35C, F-35B, and F-35A., Lockheed Martin None of this addresses the overall costs involved with flying and maintaining the F-35, either. The operational and logistical demands of the stealthy Joint Strike Fighters are significant greater than previous fourth generation aircraft in general, which has long raised concerns about the potential difficulties in operating large fleets of the stealth fighters in the future. These fears have been particularly pronounced with regards to the Marine Corps, which is transitioning to a force where the F-35B will eventually be its only jet combat aircraft . The data POGO obtained, coupled with the information from other available sources, would seem to bear this out, at least for the foreseeable future. It also only lends more weight to plans the Navy, and now the Air Force, are pursuing to operate a mix of fifth and advanced fourth generation aircraft going forward. To this end, the Navy has been continuing to purchase increasingly more capable sub-variants of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to serve alongside its F-35Cs. At the suggestion of Pentagon cost analysts, the Air Force is now looking to buy improved F-15X Advanced Eagle jets to supplement its F-35As. F-35Cs over NAS Lemoore in California. , USN It also puts into question the viability of the F-35 fleets in their present state to adequately perform during a protracted conflict . If the Marines need seven jets just to ensure that one is full mission capable, it only drives up the total number of aircraft the service would need to deploy and sustain to generate the required sorties during any sort of high-end, high-tempo operation. On top of that, the F-35 is all about “fusing” its deeply integrated systems capabilities together for a synergistic effect. When the aircraft only has some of its systems operational at any given time, the advantage of this deep integration degrades steeply. If nothing else, the dismal full mission capable rates for the F-35B and C call into question the actual combat utility of either aircraft broadly, despite the former’s recent operational outing and the latter’s recent IOC milestone. The new data only adds to the long-standing questions about the exact capabilities of all three Joint Strike Fighter variants as they stand now. But it hardly matters what their capabilities are on paper if just a tiny fraction of them are actually fully mission capable at any given time.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 27, 2019",F-117 Sported Mysterious “Dark Knights” Tail Flash During Recent Mojave Desert Flights,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yet another new tidbit of information has emerged regarding recent F-117 Nighthawk operations over and around Panamint Valley, California. Photos from the aircraft’s famous appearance near the aviation photographer haven of Rainbow Canyon have shown the black jets largely stripped of markings, aside from one peculiar and high-profile addition on one of the planes—a color tail stripe prominently displayed on the F-117’s ‘v’ tails. It reads “Dark Knights” and has the iconic planform shape of an F-117 towards the tail’s leading edge. The first generation stealth jets were officially retired over a decade ago, but the type is still flying in small numbers . You can read all of our years of coverage on the F-117 and the fascinating topic of its continued operation here . Most recently, it was reported that some of the Nighthawks had been returned to operational service to fly combat operations in the Middle East—a claim we broke down in detail in two special features linked here and here . So, suffice it to say that the appearance of the mysterious tail flash only adds to the intrigue surrounding the stealth jet and its ongoing flight operations. The shot showing the tail band can be seen in the photo in the tweet below. Higher resolution photos can be seen on Air Forces Monthly website linked in the tweet and here . Let’s start with the name. Dark Knights would certainly be a great name even for the small cadre of pilots and maintainers that are known to keep roughly four to six F-117s flyable at any given time at the mothballed force’s home, Tonopah Test Range Airport . The “dark” part of the name could likely signify the shadowy nature of the unit’s existence—the USAF has elected to stay bizarrely quiet about the status of its F-117s since the type’s official retirement and banishment to the high-security airfield in a very remote part of the Nevada desert. Dark Knights also has a pop culture connection. Arguably the most beloved Batman movie ever used the Caped Crusader’s nickname “Dark Knight” in its title. Batman, a vigilante that takes on his enemies alone in the dead of night while wearing a black suit of armor certainly sounds like a good fit for the F-117 and its mission set. There is also already a Dark Knights squadron in the USAF. 338th Training Squadron is based at Keelser AFB and is part of Air Education Training Command. According to the Keesler AFB’s webpage, the unit trains airmen in “RF transmission, airfield systems, ground radar, cyber transport.” The existence of this very public unit is interesting, but it doesn’t appear to have any relation to the F-117 or its continued flying operations. USAF/Wikicommons The Knight moniker also has a historical relation to the F-117 program overall. In 1993, as F-117 operations relocated to Holloman AFB in New Mexico, the 9th Fighter Squadron, known by the nickname “Iron Knights,” took over F-117 operations from the 415th Fighter Squadron. That unit had flown the F-117 during the tail-end of its period of the program’s secrecy from the type’s initial operational home at Tonopah Test Range Airport, through declassification, and on to incredible success during Operation Desert Storm . The 9th Fighter Squadron was one of just two operational F-117 squadrons following the type’s bedding down at Holloman AFB. Apparently, sometime in the second half of the 1990s, the 9th Fighter Squadron changed its nickname from “Iron Knights” to “Flying Knights.” Regardless, the Knight nickname has a special place in F-117 lore and history. Flightlineinsignia.com Some may say the appearance of the tail flash flown on a jet with nearly all its other markings sprayed over seems indicative that a new squadron, possibly one with greater manpower and capabilities than the skeleton crew that has kept a handful of F-117s flying for years, has been established. But really, it’s all anyone’s guess. As we noted in our piece on the F-117 Middle East deployment rumors , there is no real evidence to support such claims nor the existence of a F-117 combat force of any size, although there may— or may not —have been a real requirement and clear logic behind secretly returning a number of F-117s back to operational service. What’s more likely is that the markings just highlight what has existed for many years—the name of the unit tasked with keeping F-117s airborne for test and currency purposes and with maintaining the dozens of airframes cocooned five to a hangar at Tonopah. You are probably wondering why a jet that isn’t supposed to be seen have a tail flash? The answer is likely morale, at least mainly. But once again, we just don’t know what the exact circumstances and origins are behind badging. It’s also worth noting something we have pointed out time and again, that these aircraft could very well be operated by contractors, not the USAF. This is actually something we have been told multiple times in the past and it would make a lot of sense. As such, slapping a non-standard decal of the contractor unit’s chosen nickname on one of the F-117’s tails seems far less puzzling than the alternative explanation. Still, in retrospect, there were signs that the Knight name was associated with ongoing F-117 operations of a semi-clandestine nature for a long time. The callsign “Knight” has been used for years by F-117s flying sorties over the Nellis Test and Training Range complex . Up until just a few weeks ago, nobody had ever seen one operate outside of that desolate expanse post retirement. But now the aircraft are remarkably active, and even interactive with aviation photographers in Panamint Valley. The video below is from our friend Jamie Hunter—the boss of the always wonderful Combat Aircraft magazine—who was just in Panamint Valley to look into the recent sightings. In the video, firsthand witnesses talk about how the jet flew up and down Panamint Valley while F-16s orbited at the opposite ends on the jet’s racetrack pattern. The F-117s were photographed without their radar reflective devices installed and have repeated the mission a number of times in recent days. This sounds a lot like sensor testing with the F-16s using onboard radars and/or infrared search and track systems to gauge their performance against the best low-observable control variable the USAF has—the F-117. Back in 2014, I wrote the following as part of an large piece that speculated on why the F-117s were still flying: At the time of the F-117s official retirement, and its subsequent banishment to tomb-like hangars deep in the Nevada Desert, the aircraft was the most understood low observable platform in the history of aeronautics. Hundreds of thousands of hours were flown on the fleet of 64 aircraft (including pre-production versions), crashes were deeply investigated and improvements on the effectiveness of the aircraft were constantly being made. In other words, the F-117 is a known commodity to the DoD and the USAF, and this is especially true when it comes to the aircraft’s unique radar, radio, and infrared signature. In fact, I would not be surprised if the F-117 represents the most studied aircraft “signature” of all time. With this in mind, the F-117 could be theoretically used as something of a “flying measuring stick” for evaluating a radar system’s ability to detect and track low-observable flying objects. Or conversely, it could be used as a surrogate to test new radar absorbent materials and coatings applied to its flat, facet like structure that was originally built to accept such applications. By specifically utilizing the F-117 for such-real life tests and evaluations, defense program managers could have a control variable, in this case the F-117′s well documented radar cross-section, infrared, and visual signature, and an independent variable for which to test upon it. That independent variable being an experimental radar absorbent material or other signature control application. Testers of new signature control applications, such as an innovative new version of radar absorbent material (RAM), could leverage highly accurate real-life metrics and historical data collected throughout the life and development of the F-117. They can then fly their new application on the jet so that new data can be collected for which to compare and help judge the effectiveness of the experimental capability being tested. On the radar and infrared tracking side of argument, the F-117 is also a near-perfect and highly available low observable aircraft to test everything from ground based radars and SAM systems—both foreign and domestic—AWACS modifications, fighter radars and even infrared search and track systems. By doing so, testers can come up with a clear idea of what the capabilities of the system being tested are against a hard to detect target. In doing so, tacticians can work on solutions for defeating any weaknesses in the system while at the same time working on emphasizing its unique strengths. Even keeping a couple “sterile” F-117s available for calibrating and improving the DYCOMS array at Groom Lake, used for measuring the radar cross sections of aircraft flying under real world conditions, may be in itself an entirely necessary and worthwhile reason to keep a small cadre of F-117s operational. The trough-like valley with a relatively smooth and flat floor offers a remarkably good backdrop for testing detection and tracking of such a stealthy target flying at low-level against uniform ground clutter. It is also electromagnetic emissions quiet area, which can be beneficial for radar testing. Panamint Valley from above. , Google Earth We know for a fact that testing of advanced IRST systems is deeply underway. The F-15C/D and Super Hornet Forces are slated to get these sensors en masse soon. America’s enemies also use the technology for passive detection of airborne targets, which is totally immune to a stealthy plane’s small radar signature. In fact, we know an F-16 that flies test support out of Groom Lake/Area-51 is outfitted with the same IRST sensor intended for the Super Hornets and the Eagles. That aircraft was also caught on camera very near where the F-117 was, but it was blasting through “Star Wars Canyon.” The F-117 was designed specifically for reduced infrared signature. Its elaborate planar exhaust system spreads out and attenuates the jet’s twin GE-F404 engines’ thermal signature. This makes it a very attractive and challenging target for testing the abilities and limits of IRST sensors. New modular Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar systems are also being tested for a number of tactical jets and bombers , and the F-16, in particular . So the low-level profile the F-117s were flying, the location of the flights, and the positioning relationship with the F-16s makes a near perfect sense in regards to air-to-air sensor testing. Some final thoughts—it’s odd that the USAF remains so secretive about the four decades old F-117 force, but at the same time its pilots clearly aren’t shy about posing for cameras. Now we know that some of their aircraft even sport very visible and intriguing tail flashes. Clearly, the Dark Knights would have an amazing story to tell, one that likely includes keeping one of the most iconic, historic, and exotic flying war machines operating in the shadows over a decade after their collective flying fate was supposedly sealed. Now that the USAF is disposing of the F-117s at a rate of four per year , maybe we will finally hear their story sooner rather than later.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 19, 2020",Budget Docs Show Pentagon Aims To Loft Particle Beam Anti-Missile Weapon Into Space In Four Years,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Missile Defense Agency has offered new details about plans to develop a science fiction-sounding space-based neutral particle beam weapon to disable or destroy incoming ballistic missiles . The goal is to have a prototype system ready for a test in orbit by 2023, an ambitious schedule to demonstrate that the technology has progressed to a more useful state from when the U.S. military last explored and then abandoned the concept nearly three decades ago. The U.S. military’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2020 asks for $34 million in funding for the neutral particle beam program, or NPB, according to documents released on Mar. 18, 2019 . The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) wants a total of $380 million through 2023 fiscal cycle for development of the directed energy weapon. Defense One , citing unnamed U.S. officials, had been first to report the existence of the plan on Mar. 14, 2019. It’s also worth noting that Congress set out a goal of testing of at least one space-based missile defense system prototype by 2022 and the deployment of “an operational capability at the earliest practicable date” in the annual defense policy bill for the 2018 Fiscal Year. MDA included the new-start NPB program in a larger line item called “Technology Maturation Initiatives,” which also includes requested funding for the development of laser weapons and advanced airborne sensors. It does not expect to ask for any more funds for the particle beam system through this account in Fiscal Year 2024, which would indicate plans to move it into its own dedicated funding stream at that time. “The NPB provides a game changing space-based directed energy weapon capability for strategic missile defense,” MDA’s latest budget request says . “The NPB is a space-based, directed energy capability for homeland defense, providing a defense for boost phase and mid-course phase” of a ballistic missile’s flight. A staple in science fiction, particle beam weapons are grounded in real science . At its most basic, an NPB requires a charged particle source and a means of accelerating them to near-light speed to create the beam itself. An extremely rudimentary graphic showing the components of a neutral particle beam system., via Embry-Riddle Aeronautic University When this beam of charged particles hits something it produces effects similar to that of laser , namely extreme heat on the surface of the target capable of burning a hole through certain materials depending on the strength of the weapon. If the particles are not sufficently powerful to destroy something such as a missile or reentry vehicle, they may still be able to pass through the outer shells of those targets and disrupt, damage, or destroy internal components, similar broadly to how a microwave weapon functions. In addition, since particle beams respond different to different materials, there is the potential that the system might also have the capability to discriminate between real incoming warheads a ballistic missile has released and decoys. Seperate sensors would be necessary to observe the impacts and categorize the results. But if it worked, this would help other ballistic missile defense systems, which generally have short engagement windows to begin with, focus only on actual threats. The characteristics of these particles would make it hard, if not impossible for an opponent to shield their weapons from the effects or otherwise employ countermeasures, short of destroying the NPB itself, as well. All of this has long made the potential of a particle beam weapon attractive, especially for missile defense. As part of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, the U.S. military experimented with NPBs and hired Martin-Marietta , McDonnell Douglas , TRW, and a team from General Electric and Lockheed to craft potential designs for a space-based system. Between 1984 and 1993, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) spent approximately $794 million on the concept, according to a 1993 report from the General Accounting Office, now known as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). A mockup of McDonnell-Douglas’ space-based NPB., McDonnell-Douglas via Aerospace Projects Review Most notably, in July 1989, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in cooperation with the SDIO, conducted the Beam Experiments Aboard a Rocket test, or BEAR. This involved placing an actual particle beam system on board a sounding rocket and shooting it out of the Earth’s atmosphere. As of 2018, this remained the “most energetic particle beam ever flown,” according to LANL presentation . “The experiment successfully demonstrated that a particle beam would operate and propagate as predicted outside the atmosphere and that there are no unexpected side-effects when firing the beam in space.” A picture of the particle beam-carrying sounding rocket ahead of the BEAR test., LANL However, the SDIO ultimately pursued a plan to build a massive constellation of space-based kinetic interceptors, known as Brilliant Pebbles , coupled with an equally extensive sensor network in orbit and on Earth. The entire project came to an end in 1993 ahead of the incoming administration of President Bill Clinton, who renamed SDIO the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization – the forerunner of MDA – and refocused its efforts on terrestrial missile defense. SDIO’s particle beam program proved to be impractical given the technology available at the time. The prospective space-based systems were large and required massive power sources, with nuclear power being the most viable option. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in funding over nearly a decade between the 1980s and 1990s, the previous NPB effort did not demonstrate a beam powerful enough to produce the desired effects on a target or produce a sufficiently lightweight power source design, according to the 1993 GAO report . Despite the BEAR experiment, there had been no test of an actual complete weapon system by that point, either. Artwork depicting the NPB system from the BEAR test., via the National Air and Space Museum “We’ve come a long way in terms of the technology we use today to where a full, all-up system wouldn’t be the size of three of these conference rooms, right? We now believe we can get it down to a package that we can put on as part of a payload to be placed on orbit,” an unnamed U.S. military official told Defense One in regards to the new particle beam initiative. “Power generation, beam formation, the accelerometer that’s required to get there and what it takes to neutralize that beam, that capability has been matured and there are technologies that we can use today to miniaturize.” But even if a practical and functional design is possible, there’s no guarantee it would necessarily provide the promised capability, especially against ballistic missiles in their boost phase. Striking missiles in this first stage of their flight is attractive because they are moving relatively slow and are producing a massive heat signature that makes them easier to spot and track. It also means that the missile’s contents rain down over or near the launch country in a more localized manner than if destroyed during mid-course or terminal phases of flight. Unfortunately, they’re also moving through the atmosphere for a significant part of the boost phase. The beam that an NPB shoots out are notably vulnerable to distortion and deflection, since the particles can easily get sent off course by ricocheting off other particles hanging in the air. There’s a reason why, if you want to build an NPB at all, putting it in the vacuum of space makes the most sense. The amount of power necessary to ensure the beam remains both focused and powerful at appreciable ranges and for enough time to actual damage or destroy a target in the atmosphere could be immense. An NPB concept from the SDI program using a nuclear reactor at the rear to power the system., via Aerospace Projects Review For some context on the potential scale of power generation one might be looking at, in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. military had also considered a ground-based particle beam that could defeat ballistic missiles in its latter stages of flight called Seesaw. The Advanced Research Projects Agency determined it would take a system propagating a particle beam across hundreds of miles of tunnels to work properly. To create the necessary to power supply, Nicholas Christofilos , a Greek physicist working at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at the time, went so far as to propose using nuclear bombs to effectively create a ludicrously large drain hole that would allow the entire volume of the Great Lakes to flow into a massive hydroelectric generator complex underneath, according to Sharon Weinberger’s 2017 book The Imagineers of War : The Untold History of DARPA, the Pentagon Agency that Changed The World . Needless to say, this idea was absurd and the entire program never left the drawing board. Technological improvements since then in various fields, such as power generation efficiency and adaptive focusing systems, would reduce these requirements, but they could still be prohibitive depending on other design constraints. This would also be much less of an issue for exoatmospheric engagements. Beyond these potential technical issues with the beam itself, boost-phase ballistic missile defense systems need to be in an optimal position to engage their target during a very short amount of time after a launch. On average this phase of a missile’s flight is around five minutes at most in total. Sensors would first have to spot and categorize the threat after which American officials would make a decision to engage or not. A general timeline of the boost phase of ballistic missiles and the time available for defense systems to respond., via American Physical Society Ensuring that there are enough space-based NPBs “parked” in orbit near even a portion of known and possible launch sites could be a costly proposition that would also require significant investments in the U.S. military’s ballistic missile defense sensor architecture, a separate issue you can read about in more detail here and here . The speed of the particles and the range of the weapons in the vacuum of space could help mitigate these issues. It would also be far less of a concern during the mid-course portion of the missile’s flight where the entire engagement would occur in space or the very upper reaches of the atmosphere and there would be more time to line up the best shot. “It’s a very short timeline, first to even know where it [the missile] is coming from…It’s less than a couple minutes before it leaves the atmosphere,” the unnamed defense official that spoke to Defense One admitted. “So, you have to have a weapon that’s on station, that’s not going to be taken out by air batteries and so we have been looking at directed energy applications for that. But you have to scale up power to that megawatt class. You’ve got to reduce the weight. You’ve got to have a power source. It’s a challenge, technically.” “I can’t say that it is going to be at a space and weight requirement that’s going to actually be feasible, but we’re pushing forward with the prototyping and demo,” this individual continued. “We need to understand as a Department [of Defense], the costs and what it would take to go do that. There’s a lot of folklore…that says it’s either crazy expensive or that it’s free. It needs to be a definitive study.” Feasibility concerns notwithstanding, there would be political and legal ramifications on top of everything else, too. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty bans the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. Though the NPB itself would not fit this definition, a nuclear power source would still have the potential to prompt outcry and formal protests. A space-based arms race would be another concern and one that is already brewing in the minds of American , Russian , and Chinese officials . The Russians and the Chinese , in particular, are already expanding their arsenals of anti-satellite weapons . A Russian MiG-31 Foxhound carries an air-launched anti-satellite weapon in a test., ShipSash Particle beams by their nature can also be difficult to detect and conclusively trace back to a particular source, making them non-attributable. This is something that Michael Griffin, presently Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and a major proponent of NPBs, has described in the past as an “ advantage .” But it’s also something that America’s adversaries could look to exploit and weaponize, blaming the U.S. government for all manner of explained phenomena in space. Russia has a long history of making unsubstantiated allegations against the U.S. government, claiming in recent years that Americans and their allies have staged chemical weapons attacks on civilians in Syria, are actively supporting ISIS terrorists in that country and in Afghanistan , and are running a covert biological weapons program in Georgia. A constellation of particle beam weapons in space capable, at least in principle, of conducting non-attributable attacks, would be an obvious goldmine for Russian propagandists seeking to spread conspiratorial claims, blaming any hole that appears in a spacecraft or malfunctioning satellite on an unprovoked particle beam attack. It might be hard to challenge these claims. Beyond it’s missile defense capabilities, a space-based particle beam does seem like an ideal anti-satellite weapon. It would offer an easy way to quickly knock out satellites, or at least disable them, in a crisis. It would be hard for an opponent to detect such as an attack was occurring in the first place and even more difficult to counter. But proponents in the U.S. government, especially Undersecretary of Defense Griffin, who worked on the Reagan-era SDI program, are adamant about at least exploring the possibility of a space-based particle beam weapon system. “We should not lose our way as we come out of the slough of despondence in directed energy into an environment that is more welcoming of our contributions. We should not lose our way with some of the other technologies that were pioneered in the ’80s and early-’90s and now stand available for renewed effort,” he declared in 2018 . It remains to be seen whether MDA will determine that the technical and other considerations have changed sufficiently in the last 30 years to make the idea of particle beam weapons in orbit any more practical than it was during the Cold War. But we should get a better idea in the next five years as the Pentagon pushes toward its goal of lofting a prototype particle beam weapon into orbit for the first time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",U.S. Army Recently Sought Demo Of German Puma Armored Vehicle It Had Rejected Years Ago,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A senior U.S. Army acquisition official recently had to cancel plans to view a demonstration of the German Puma infantry fighting vehicle. The revelation is curious given that the service rejected this same design in a previous competition and the Germany’s Rheinmetall, together with American partner Raytheon, is already competing to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family with another vehicle. On Mar. 16, 2019, Defense News was first to report that the U.S. Army’s Jeffrey White, who serves as a deputy to Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Bruce Jette, had been planning to observe the Puma in action at the German Army’s Munster training facility. The event ended up cancelled due to a scheduling conflict and it is not clear whether or not White, or another Army official, will get to see the demonstration in the end. It is also unclear why White was looking to see the Puma in the first place. The Army is in the midst of a program to acquire a replacement for the Bradley, formally as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), which is part of the larger Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) effort. But there has been no previous indication that Rheinmetall or Krauss Maffei Wegmann, who developed the Puma as a joint venture, would look to submit this particular design. In October 2018 , Rheinmetall did announce its intention to bid on the OMFV deal, in cooperation with Raytheon, but with a vehicle based on its new KF41 Lynx design. The demonstration could indicate that the Army is looking at Puma, as well. https://youtube.com/watch?v=_rJInij72jk “Many of our NATO allies have very capable tanks,” Secretary of the Army Mark Esper told reporters in January 2018 during a visit to U.S. Army Europe’s headquarters in Germany. “As I think about a next-generation combat vehicle, we should look at our allies, and look at their designs, and look at how they’ve built combat vehicles and combat systems, and think about adopting some of those.” The Army has actually already evaluated Puma itself as part of the abortive Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program, which began in 2009 . For that competition, Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei partnered with American companies Boeing and SAIC. In 2013, the Congressional Budget Office issued a scathing report lambasting the service over its choice of GCV prototype design, which had ballooned in weight to 84 tons , more than that of an M1 Abrams tank . That same report had said the Puma had been the most capable of the designs the Army had evaluated and would also have saved it almost $15 billion in total program costs. The service ultimately cancelled the GCV program entirely in February 2014. A Germany Army Puma crests a sand dune in the United Arab Emirates during a hot weather test., Bundeswehr Rheinmetall has been working on Lynx since 2015 as a competitor to the Puma, but has so far not found any customers. The German company developed it with an eye toward the export market and uses a greater number of commercial-of-the-shelf automotive parts and other existing components to reduce overall cost and potential strains on logistics chains. Rheinmetall also designed the Lynx with modularity in mind so that it could readily accept different mission modules to perform different roles. So far, however, the two variants the company has shown publicly, the KF31 and KF41, are relatively similar. The KF41 has a larger overall configuration, though, with a weight of around 44 tons, almost 10 tons heavier than the KF31 and even bigger than the Puma in its base configuration. The newer Lynx version also has turret, which is available in manned and unmanned configurations, with a larger 35mm automatic cannon. The turret can also accept modular pods on either side to add anti-tank guided missiles, a launch system for small drones or loitering munitions , or additional equipment. The Army may still be interested in giving Puma a look given it previous experience and the CBO’s previous assessment of that design. Whoever proposed the demonstration in Germany could be looking toward the future, as well, and potentially billing the Puma, as a contender for the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) program, another part of the larger NGCV project. As its name suggests, the Army wants the Bradley-replacing OMFV to be optionally-manned rather than entirely unmanned. The goal is for these vehicles to work in close cooperation with fleets of entirely unmanned and at least semi-autonomous RCVs. The RCVs could provide additional firepower at lower cost, extend the sensor reach of a formation, scout ahead without risking the manned elements of a force, and more. The Army presently has plans for three tiers of RCVs, the first of which is light design weighing less than 10 tons that the service hopes will be “attritable,” meaning that it will be low cost enough that commanders could treat it as a an asset they could tactically sacrifice on the battlefield if necessary. The RCV program also envisions a medium vehicle between 10 and 20 tons and a heavyweight companion tipping the scales at 20 to 30 tons, which would not be expendable in any way. A US Army briefing slide from January 2019 laying out three possible tiers of future Robotic Combat Vehicles., US Army The Army is looking at whether or not small unmanned ground vehicles it is presently testing to help support infantry squads might be able to fill the RCV’s light requirements. The service plans to test that operational concept with units in Europe in 2020. It hasn’t yet said what designs it might be looking at for either of the other two size categories. Though Puma is around 30 tons in its base configuration, an unmanned version, or derivative thereof, could potentially be lighter and fit in the heavy tier. It would certainly make logistical sense too, if at all possible, to adopt OMFVs and RCVs that use similar designs. Puma, or Lynx, operating in an optional unmanned mode could be a valuable testbed for both technologies for future RCVs or as a means of developing tactics, techniques, and procedures for heavy mechanized ground operations involving manned-unmanned teams. The Army has already been using these optionally-manned Humvees, as well as other vehicles, as surrogates for developing manned-unmanned ground combat tactics, techniques, and procedures., US Army Finding a way to blend bids on different parts of the NGCV program could be a big opportunity for Rheinmetall,  Krauss Maffei Wegmann, and any other contenders , too. The OMFV contract by itself stands to be particularly lucrative. “It’s a big $42 billion franchise program and it’s a big activity, so we need to get started quickly,” Raytheon’s Brand Barnard said regarding potential plans to establish domestic production capacity for Lynx in Michigan, according to local Fox News report on Mar. 14, 2019. “But we have started in the right place.” The Army has a very aggressive timeline for the OMFV program, which may have also led to it looking at what value the existing Puma design might have, even as a surrogate for testing. It’s latest budget request, the service cut the amount of Bradleys it expects to upgrade to the new A4 configuration by a fifth in favor of new vehicles. Earlier in March 2019, the service also announced that it would purchase 14 pre-production OMFV prototypes, as well as other components and services, from each contractor or team it selects to progress to the engineering and manufacturing development phase in 2020. The present plan is to be able to start low-rate initial production of the selected OMFV design by the middle of 2023 and have the first brigade entirely equipped with the new vehicles by the end of 2025. In parallel, the Army has already begun work on what it calls “NGCV Future Capability,” which will involve multiple operational user evaluations of separate experimental vehicle designs, such as potential RCVs, in the coming years. The service wants to begin buying at least some of the fully unmanned vehicles by 2023, as well. A “pre-decision” timeline of various Next Generation Combat Vehicle developments, including “NGCV Future Capability,” as of August 2018., US Army With the Army pushing hard on these various efforts to modernize its armored vehicle fleets, it will be interesting to see whether it gives the Puma a second look after the better part of a decade. Correction: Any earlier version of this article said that Rheinmetall was the manufacturer of the Puma and that its Lynx was derived from it. Rheinmetall developed Puma together with Krauss Maffei Wegmann and a joint venture company is responsible for the vehicle. Rheinmetall subsequently developed the Lynx by itself as a competing product.
