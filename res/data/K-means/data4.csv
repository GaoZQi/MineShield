By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tom Cruise dropped one hell of a viral image today on his Instagram account to promote the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun . It showed Cruise, Maverick hamlet in hand, gazing toward an F/A-18F Super Hornet with “FEEL THE NEED.” written across the image. The post was hashtagged #Day1, indicating that Cruise’s second fighter jet-themed Hollywood adventure has just begun. The sepia-toned photo came from Paramount’s marketing department, with the brand’s logo branded at the bottom. The teaser sent social media into a frenzy, with ‘defense Twitter’ having an especially good time with the post—although some takes landed far better than others. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) Apparently, the Navy made Naval Air Station North Island available for production this week and that’s where the photo was shot: The USAF took advantage of the announcement to poke a bit of fun at the Super Hornet’s less than outstanding high-speed performance: The Navy was quick to opine to the USAF’s social media taunt, but the guys and gals in blue came back with a withering counterpunch: Raytheon, on the other hand, failed miserably by actually posting a picture of an F-15E instead of a Super Hornet: Dave Brown, an editor at the Washington Examiner , rightfully pointed out that Mav hadn’t really crushed the Navy’s promotional structural over the last three decades, even after shooting down a bunch of MiG-28s: David Larter had an even better plot idea regarding Maverick’s rank: But The Washington Examiner’s take on how the F-35 fits into the whole Top Gun 2 equation was less than stellar, as I pointed out in my own Twitter post: And quite frankly, we really don’t know what jets will be featured and how in the screenplay, and apparently neither does the Navy!: In fact, according to Task & Purpose, the Navy has only approved two days of shooting thus far for the project and is waiting to review a final script. Regardless, the F-35 program doesn’t seem upset with the production at this point in time: Still, Stephen Trimble sarcastically predicts an all too common manufacturer dispute is on the horizon over the film’s starring jet: Some think the film should reflect the less glamorous realities faced by the Navy these days: @Toroonthemove had an ominous warning of what may be in store: And of course huge penises drawn in the sky were bound to come up: As to what scenes Cruise was filming at NAS North Island, it looks like we might get a recreation of the iconic motorcycle/Tomcat scene from the original film which was also shot on an airfield near the runway. In that case, the location was NAS Miramar, then the Navy’s coveted ‘Fightertown USA,’ which now belongs to the Marine Corps: There was speculation that seemed to have some factual support behind it that Top Gun 2, now titled Top Gun: Maverick (seems obvious), would be about humans in the cockpit versus drones. That movie has already been made and it’s called Stealth , but thankfully it seems as if the Top Gun 2 production team has since stepped away from that plotline. And it’s not as if there aren’t plenty of other ideas to work with, including this idea I posited four years ago. Another outstanding question is whether or not the film will feature the amazing aerial footage that the original so brilliantly showcased—you can read all about how that footage was shot by a Topgun instructor who was part of the production by clicking here . Or—GASP!—will it be a CGI filled affair like we have become so accustomed to? Without real aerial photography—which is far easier to obtain nowadays through companies like Wolfe Air and GoPro like action cams —the film won’t have the same winning texture. And then there is the question of the soundtrack? Who will step in to fill Kenny Loggins shoes? All these questions and more will be answered—for better or worse—on July 12th, 2019 when Top Gun: Maverick hits theaters.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2018",General Atomics Shows Off Engine That Will Power Its Proposed MQ-25 Drone Tanker,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics has released a video of a test of the Pratt & Whitney PW815 turbofan that will power its entry for the U.S. Navy’s MQ-25 Stringray drone tanker competition. The demonstration comes as the service gets closer to finally picking a winning a design for what could be its first carrier-based unmanned aircraft. Though the California-based drone maker only released the clip on May 31, 2018, it says that the PW815 test occurred on April 5, 2018. For the event, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GS-ASI) engineers attached inlet and exhaust components from its still-in-development MQ-25 design to the turbofan, which was fixed to a trailer on the ground. They then turned on the engine and gathered unspecified data about its performance. According to General Atomics and Pratt & Whitney, the experiment was successful and met all of the desired test points. “Through the superb efforts of personnel from both companies, we were able to move the test date forward by almost two months, from the originally scheduled date in late May,” David Alexander, GA-ASI’s President of Aircraft Systems, said in an associated press release . “This is just another example of how we are working to reduce risk and accelerate capability.” The PW815 is an efficient, gearless, high-bypass design that Pratt & Whitney developed primarily as an engine option for business jet-size aircraft . Gulfstream, so far, is the primary customer, having selected the turbofan for its new G600 aircraft . “GA-ASI … selected the PW815 engine for the MQ-25 based on its exceptional performance and fuel efficiency,” Alexander added in his press statement. “This performance and efficiency will subsequently translate into more available fuel for the receiving aircraft. Additionally, initial studies have shown the PW815 is well-suited for a carrier environment.” The PW815 is notably more powerful than the engines that Boeing and Lockheed Martin plan to use on their MQ-25 entries. Boeing’s design has a Rolls-Royce AE 3007N , similar to the engine in Northrop Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawk drone and capable of providing around 9,000 pounds of thrust. A General Electric F404 , which generates about 11,000 pounds of thurst, would power Lockheed Martin’s proposed aircraft . Pratt & Whitney’s engine has a maximum thrust of around 16,000 pounds, putting it in an entirely different class than the other two engines. In addition, General Atomics’ overall concept features a very traditional intake with a vertical splitter that would provide good airflow to maximize the turbofan’s performance. An artist’s conception of General Atomics’ MQ-25 proposal., GA-ASI It is a decidedly lower-cost and potentially low-risk approach to the Boeing and Lockheed Martin proposals. Those companies have put forward what appear to be aircraft with a greater emphasis on low-observability. Boeing, in particular, using a notably complicated flush inlet arrangement in its design, but stealthy air intakes are complex affairs in general. Though General Atomics’ considerable experience with the Avenger , also known as the Predator C, clearly inspired its MQ-25 design, and it shares a similar engine intake and exhaust arrangement, the new design has few, if any significant stealth features. Based on the available concept art, the aircraft would also appear to have a broadly similar configuration to the Global Hawk. A screen capture from a Boeing video showing the flush inlet design on its MQ-25 prototype., Boeing capture General Atomics’ configuration, especially the engine arrangement, could let its Stingray concept exceed the Navy’s basic performance and range requirements and provide the service with an especially big flying fuel truck, as well as be a cost-effective alternative to its competitors. But with so much extra thrust, it’s hard not to wonder if the firm expects its design will also be larger and heavier to begin with than its competitors, too. While General Atomics was the first of the competitors in the MQ-25 program to offer a glimpse of its design in October 2017, but has still not unveiled a full-scale mockup or prototype. In April 2018, around the time of the engine test, the firm told then Aviation Week reporter James Drew that it had no plans to build a flying example of its drone unless it won the contract. The company has used an existing Avenger as a surrogate to evaluate technologies that will help Navy personnel move the final Stingrays around a carrier deck. Still, the company has repeatedly expressed confidence in its proposal and It is also worth noting that Boeing says it will partner with GA-ASI on its design it that company wins. So far, though, the Chicago-headquarter planemaker has kept the team coordinating that potential collaboration separate from the individuals working on its own MQ-25 proposal. Still, the GA-ASI’s decision not to pursue a flying prototype has seemed somewhat curious. As our own Tyler Rogoway wrote in April 2018 : It’s worth noting that the MQ-25 tender does not require competitors to put forward a flying prototype, but the Navy is not prone to taking very high developmental risks with its tactical aircraft fleet. The more risk reduction work a contender has done the better they are likely to be off. This is especially true considering the longevity of the MQ-25  program may be somewhat in doubt and major cost and timetable overruns that occur after the contract is awarded could sink the program fully. The fact that General Atomics isn’t going to roll out an actual prototype is somewhat surprising to me, as during my interview with the company’s project manager I got the impression that this was indeed the plan. Maybe things changed or maybe the engine test stand was deemed enough of a prototype going forward. Cost is also likely to be a major factor when it comes to which of the three companies will get a shot at building four early development prototypes after being awarded the contract this summer. There is no denying that General Atomics has large scale series production of unmanned aircraft down. … What General Atomics’ team lacks for the MQ-25 competition is experience in naval aviation, but the company was able to lock down Boeing as a subcontractor to help them with just that if they win the Stingray contract. This was a genius move on behalf of General Atomics that once again alleviates risk and gives the Navy piece of mind that Boeing’s long-running carrier-borne aviation experience will be injected into the MQ-25 whether they pick Boeing or General Atomics. General Atomics’ test run of the PW815 with the fittings it would use on its prototype MQ-25 show that it is pursuing significant development of the aircraft even if it doesn’t plan to build a complete aircraft before the contract award. As noted the company has extensive experience building unmanned aircraft already and it likely that it has established and sophisticated methods to model at least some of the potential performance of future designs digitally without necessarily having to physically construct one. The firm had employed software-based simulations during its development of the Sea Avenger for the Navy’s abortive Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike ( UCLASS ) program, which preceded the present iteration of the MQ-25 project, to help rapidly alter the design configuration to meet changing requirements. General Atomics could easily build actual sub-scale models for aerodynamic and other testing, as well. An artist’s rendering of the General Atomics Stingray design refueling an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter., GA-ASI But there are still questions about how serious the Navy necessarily is to the program itself, which I explored in February 2018: Unfortunately, at present, the firm or firms that win the MQ-25 engineering and development contract would get a guaranteed order of just four aircraft over at least the next six years, and possibly longer. That need to commit significant time and money up front developing an unmanned system that the Navy might not ultimately buy at all in significant numbers – the service says it reserves the right to abort the project and start again if the drones don’t live up to expectations – is likely a major reason why Northrop Grumman dropped out of the competition entirely. And this six-year schedule is only if the program continues as planned. As noted, the actual delivery schedule calls for the contractor to supply just half the already tiny number of aircraft within three years. With how many times the Navy’s unmanned carrier projects have morphed over the past decade, it’s not hard to imagine shifting priorities yet again in a three to six year time frame. The social realities within the naval aviation community with regards to a future full of high-end unmanned aircraft flying from carrier decks is also a glaring issue few like to discuss. General Atomics’ strategy of using surrogates and testing of critical components, along with the likely use of modeling, physical or otherwise, ahead of the contract would seem to make sense in this context. The Navy’s plans don’t even require an initial test flight of the winning design before 2021. The Navy has said it expects to award the MQ-25 contract by the end of Summer 2018. At that point, we’ll have a better idea if having a full-up prototype had a significant impact on the process or whether demonstrating that important parts of the design work was enough for the service’s contracting officials.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 27, 2020",Russian Commandos Debut Arctic Combat Buggy That Looks Right Out Of Fast And Furious,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of Russia’s most elite troops appear to be eying a variant of the Chechen-made Chaborz M-3 combat buggy modified for Arctic operations . Looking like something out of a Hollywood blockbuster or better suited to carrying around action figures , the vehicle is the latest indication of the country’s steadily expanding presence in the highly strategic Arctic Region . The Arctic or “Northern” variant of the M-3 first appeared at a training exercise in the Franz Josef Archipelago, a chain of islands in Russia’s far north that sits above the Arctic Circle, in March 2018 . The National Guard of Russia hosted this event, which also included special operations elements from the country’s Federal Security Service , or FSB, and the semi-autonomous region of Chechnya. Regular Russian military forces also took part and the vehicles subsequently appeared at other National Guard drills in the region. “The training conducted under special geographical and climactic conditions allows us to try out new forms of military action, harmonize management systems and to test perspective kinds of military equipment and armament,” Viktor Zolotov, head of the Russian National Guard, said after one of these events in April 2018. “Without a doubt, the experience acquired by the troops will be used to prepare other units.” The exercises in the Franz Josef Archipelago consisted of a number of counter-terrorism scenarios, including responding to a mock hijacking aboard the nuclear-powered icebreaker Sovetsky Soyuz . In addition to the modified Chaborz, these drills featured a variety of other new and advanced equipment, including special operators inserting using wingsuits and employing improved navigational equipment. The video below shows various scenes from the exercises in the Franz Josef Archipelago, including the Arctic Chaborz M-3 in action. https://youtube.com/watch?v=J11iqxJ6AaI The drill, which occurred in March 2018, appears to be the first ever public appearance of the Arctic M-3, though. There is little information about the vehicle as of yet, but it seems to be a relatively simple conversion of the original design that replaces the rear, powered wheels with triangle-shaped tracks and substitutes the front, unpowered axel with a pair of skis. The basic M-3 is 4×2 dune buggy type vehicle that has room for a driver, a second occupant sitting next to them with a mounted 7.62mm machine gun, and a third individual seated in a semi-raised position in the rear manning another weapon. The mount in the latter position can accept a 7.62mm machine gun or a 30mm automatic grenade launcher. Members of the Russian National Guard stand in front of an Arctic Chaborz., National Guard of Russia The original Chaborz was the product of a collaboration between Chechnya’s F-Motorsport and the private Russian University of Spetsnaz . The word “spetsnaz,” a contraction of a Russian phrase that translates as “special purpose,” is roughly analogous to the generic English term “special operations forces.” Chechen manufacturer Chechenauto then began serial production of the M-3 in 2017 and introduced a larger, six-man M-6 type that same year. The original Chaborz weighs around 2,800 pounds, significantly less than even specially designed lightweight 4×4 tactical vehicles , and can hit a top speed on improved roads of over 80 miles per hour. It reportedly has good off-road capabilities, as well. A regular, wheeled Chaborz M-3., Russian University of Spetsnaz It is unclear whether the Northern model has comparable performance. Video from the exercises in the Franz Josef Archipelago, seen at the beginning of this article, does show it keeping pace with personal snowmobiles and demonstrating significant maneuverability in the snowy conditions. If the Arctic version has similar capabilities, it could be a boon over existing snowmobiles, dog sleds, and other means of transportation the Russian military currently employs in the region. It definitely has more organic firepower with its mounted weapons than any of those existing options. The Arctic type is almost certainly just as air-transportable as the standard M-3, which would further increase its flexibility. The regular wheeled design can fit inside a Mi-17-type helicopter , as well as larger fixed-wing cargo aircraft, such as the Il-76 , An-32 , or An-74 cargo planes . A Mi-17-type helicopter on display with a Chaborz M-3 positioned at the rear., Russian University of Spetsnaz All of these features could make it much better suited to supporting small units in the assault, conducting reconnaissance, or supporting special operators during direct action missions when compared to the Berkut-2 , another snowmobile that Russia recently began acquiring for Arctic operations. Those vehicles feature a fully-enclosed, heated cab, but are much slower and only have a single machine gun mount in the rear. The Chaborz would leave its occupants fully exposed to the elements, though, which might limit its ability to conduct operations for extended periods, and there’s no obvious armor protection for the troops on board. It’s not clear how well its largely exposed drivetrain and other components would be able to withstand protracted exposure to sub-zero temperatures. Of course, the Berkut-2’s gunner sits outside the vehicle and there is no indication that its car-type body provides any significant defense, either. Stil, the Northern M-3 might ultimately be most attractive to the National Guard or other Russian state security forces for political reasons. Chechenauto reportedly developed the vehicle specifically at the behest of Ramzan Kadyrov , the flamboyant, social media-savvy , dictatorial leader of the semi-autonomous republic and major ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. https://youtube.com/watch?v=2T-C-UXUU0U Kadyrov was also directly responsible for the creation of the Russian University of Spetsnaz in the Chechen city of Gudermes in 2013 and is featured prominently on its website. The center has since become heavily linked to the National Guard. Putin created that force, which reports directly to Office Of The President, in 2016. In a separate presidential decree, Zolotov, the head of the organization, got a seat on the country’s National Security Council underscoring the political clout associated with the new organization. Ramazan Kadyrov wears a suit of armor to a feast with an all-female audience to celebrate his dubious election victory in 2016 in which he reportedly secured 98 percent of the vote., Sputnik The National Guard is ostensibly responsible for internal security and has taken over control of various special operations forces including elements previously assigned to the Ministry of the Interior. However, reports have painted the group as a sort of Praetorian Guard to protect Putin’s government and there are reports that it has also deployed forces to support covert activities, such as working with separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine . In addition, in line with Putin’s push to increase Russia’s presence in the Arctic, both the National Guard and Chechen Spetsnaz have been increasingly involved in training exercises and other activities in the region. In 2016, those elite Chechen forces and members of the Russian National Guard took part in joint drills at the North Pole . Viktor Zolotov, in a red beret, stands to the left of Ramzan Kadyrov in this promotion shot for the Russian University of Spetsnaz., Russian University of Spetsnaz But regardless of the vehicle’s exact performance or whoever might end up employing it, the Northern Chaborz is definitely another indicator of the Arctic’s growing significance in Russia’s domestic and foreign policy plans. The militarized snowmobile is likely to be just one of many new specialized cold weather military vehicles that will appear in the near future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 30, 2019","Listen To A P-82 Twin Mustang Purr, A Glorious Sound Not Heard In Over 30 Years","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The P-82 Twin Mustang, sometimes lovingly referred to as ‘Double Trouble’ and later redesignated the F-82, was something of an odd concept, taking two P-51 Mustang fuselages and slapping them together to create a long-range escort fighter. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t beautiful and effective. Only 272 of the aircraft were built and the last time one had flown, or even run its engines for that matter, was in 1987. Now all that is about to change. But before a first flight milestone is reached, thanks to master warbird restorer Tom Reilly , we get to see and hear one of these marvelous machines awake and humming once again, with its twin Merlin engines churning away side-by-side. XP-82 44-83887 was a prototype for what would become known as the P/F-82. You can read about how Tom came upon the project and went about restoring what was seemingly unrestorable here . But suffice it to say, over the last decade the warbird nut has made his very expensive dream nearly come true, with the imminent goal of flying the reforged XP-82 Twin Mustang to Oshkosh this Summer. Regardless of if this happens or not, a once seemingly mythical future where a Twin Mustang could still be seen skirting the heavens is about to become a reality. Here is a direct link to the video if it doesn’t show up below in your browser. The P-82 was in the works in the latter half of World War II. It was intended to be paired with B-29s on very long-range missions—up to 2,300 miles—that were well beyond the reach of P-38 Lightnings, but the type didn’t become operational until 1946. Still, the Twin Mustang went on to have a successful career, protecting the homeland for Air Defense Command and being among the first American aircraft to wade into the Korean conflict. P-82s had a range of 2,300 miles, which could be extended further with an array of drop tanks. , USAF The Twin Mustang even holds the mantle of the type to shoot down the first three North Korean aircraft of the war. It also proved to be a highly effective ground attack platform, wreaking havoc on North Korean positions with its guns, rockets, and bombs. An amazing photo of XP-82 44-83887 flying high over Muroc Army Airfield (now Edwards AFB) during testing., USAF Not long into its seven-year operational run, some of the F-82s gained a center-wing mounted radar and the electronics to go with it, making it the USAF’s top night interceptor and replacing the World War II vintage P-61 Black Widow. But even with the P-82’s great versatility and proven pedigree, the arrival of the jet age would usher in its demise. P-82G night fighter in its gloss black and red scheme and packing the massive SCR-270 radar., USAF Although it borrows on the Mustang design directly, the P-82 shares few interchangeable parts with its single-engine progenitor. Additionally, one of its Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines turns to the left, making the aircraft even harder to restore and find parts for. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of Tom Reilly and his team, the Twin Mustang is about to rise again. Oh, and while we are on the subject of dream warbirds and fork-tailed flyers, a P-61 Black Widow is also deep in the restoration process . Once finished, the Mid Atlantic Air Museum will have the only P-61 in flyable condition. The charcoal-colored night fighter and its heavy armament have captured the imaginations of military and aviation enthusiasts for over the better part of a century, and with any luck, we may see it alongside its eventual successor, the XP-82, on the airshow circuit by the end of the decade.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 9, 2018",U.S. Guided Artillery Rockets Kill 50 Taliban Leaders In A Single Strike In Afghanistan,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military says it has killed at least 50 members of the Taliban in a strike on a single target in Afghanistan using the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS . The strike highlights the weapon’s continued importance in various limited conflicts and points to its potential value, especially with upgraded capabilities , in more high-end fights against a conventional opponent. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, offered the new details on May 29, 2018, according to The Associated Press . A total of four rockets reportedly hit the compound. The U.S. military had previously announced the strike on the meeting place in Helmand Province’s Musa Qala District, which occurred on May 24, 2018, but without providing an estimated body count. The insurgents are likely to lose some ability to plan operations and otherwise organize their activities “beyond Helmand province” after the loss of so many senior individuals, O’Donnell told AP . He added that the strike was a direct product of expanded authorities President Donald Trump had given the U.S. military in Afghanistan as part of his administration’s strategy for the conflict. Separate reports said that the Musa Qala strike had been part of a broader effort that killed at least 70 Taliban leaders in total. In 2017, the United States stepped up its operations in the province, which has long been a Taliban stronghold. The video below shows the strike as seen from an unspecified intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft flying overhead. The Army officer did not elaborate on how the authorities enabled the operation. American special operators have been working together with conventional HIMARS units to target specific terrorists and small groups of individuals in Afghanistan since at least 2007 . In addition, U.S. special operations forces remained active in the country conducting these types of missions after President Barack Obama announced an end to major combat operations there in December 2014. Regardless, the operation is only the latest example of HIMARS’ utility in low-end conflicts. The system consists of a truck-mounted launcher that can fire up to six 227mm GPS-guided rockets or a single Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) quasi-ballistic missile before needing to reload. A Kansas Army National Guard HIMARS launcher., ANG The precision-guided rockets can hit targets more than 40 miles away and fly in a ballistic trajectory that allows them to fall nearly straight down on their targets, focusing their blast right on top of them. This latter capability is especially important for targeting specific buildings to get at particular individuals or groups of militants as it helps reduce the likelihood of collateral damage to nearby structures or individuals. Road-mobile, air-transportable, and with limited off-road capabilities, HIMARS can readily get into range of a target area and then relocate again if necessary. The concept of flying one of the launchers to a certain location on board a C-130 or C-17 transport plane, rolling it off, and having artillery troops quickly set up and conduct a fire mission has become such an established doctrine that the Army has even given it a name. This is now known as HIMARS Rapid Infiltration , or HI-RAIN. It’s a tactic the U.S. Marine Corps employs, as well. HIMARS, as well as howitzers firing guided shells , provide other benefits, as well. Unlike airstrikes, the artillery systems can conduct missions even if there’s poor weather over the target area. Unless there are aircraft already on station, these weapons can typically respond to requests for fire support much faster, too. And depending on the exact nature and location of the target, artillery fire missions may be better suited for engaging time-sensitive targets and giving the enemy less time to react. It is these capabilities that mean HIMARS is a core part of the Army’s future artillery plans, as well as those of the Marine Corps, including during high-intensity conflicts against near-peer opponents, such as Russia or China. At the Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018, U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian presented a briefing that showed “command posts” as part of the target set for a still-in-development extended-range 227mm Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rocket, or GMLRS-ER. Maranian is head of the Army’s so-called “cross-functional team,” or CFT, for Long Range Precision Fires, or LRPF. This group is charged with exploring a host of new artillery weapon concepts. A slide from U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian’s March 2018 briefing. HIMARS launchers with extended-range rockets are seen near the bottom engaging various targets, including “command posts.”, US Army “We’ve got to push the maximum range of all systems under development for close, deep and strategic, and we have got to outgun the enemy,” U.S. Army General Robert Brown, head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, said during a separate panel discussion at the Global Force Symposium. “We need cannons that fire as far as rockets today. We need rockets that fire as far as today’s missiles, and we need missiles out to 499 kilometers.” GMLRS-ER is a joint program the Army is running with the Marine Corps and both services would likely deploy it when it becomes available. The Marines are also separately exploring new methods of employing HIMARS and the 227mm guided artillery rocket, including from ships, to support expeditionary and other distributed operations. Another one of Brigadier General Maranian’s March 2018 briefing slides, showing the Army’s entire Long Range Precision Fires portfolio, including the GMLRS-ER effort., US Army It is also very likely that the guided artillery rocket strikes will be a component in increasingly multi-domain operations focused on neutralizing an opponent’s command and control nodes and other critical elements. Earlier in May 2018, U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, who was in charge of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria in 2017 and is now in charge of the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, revealed that his forces had ferreted out terrorist hubs using space and cyberspace assets . “We knew that the enemy had alternate command posts, but we didn’t know where they were,” he explained at the Association of the United States Army’s LANPAC Symposium and Exposition in Hawaii, according to Military.com . “So rather than strike the primary command post and then have the enemy be unknown to us for a while, we reacquired where he went to, one of the subordinate units proposed that we use … capabilities from space and cyber to deny the enemy’s primary command post, forcing him to move to and unveil his alternate command posts.” Townsend didn’t say what units had actually struck the command centers, but noted that the operation involved forces on land, at sea, and in the air, as well as in space and cyberspace. HIMARS would have been ideal for finishing these targets once other forces had identified them. Unfortunately, that operation took weeks to plan and coordinate. The general said this process would be far too slow in a high-intensity conflict against a conventional adversary. A US Marine Corps HIMARS launcher., USMC “Let’s look to future war against a near-peer threat that can contest us in one or all of the domains. We are going to have to do better,” Townsend said. “When the adversary’s combined arms armies come rolling toward our alliance, we are going to have to generate … sophisticated multi-domain operations in minutes or hours and those operations will have to last days and weeks.” It’s unclear how long the impact of the latest HIMARS strikes in Afghanistan will actually last. The Taliban have significantly expanded their operational capability as of late, conducting major operations even in various provincial hubs, as well as the country’s capital Kabul . Earlier in May 2018, the group’s fighters launched a large-scale operation into the capital of Farah Province , threatening to overrun government forces. In the end, a massive American-assisted counterattack, including a large number of airstrikes , beat back the attackers. The United States is hoping to push the Taliban to negotiate a settlement of some kind and has been stepping up its own operations against the group. The insurgents, however, seem emboldened by their recent victories and are disinclined to consider any sort of peace talks. Whatever happens, it seems clear that HIMARS will continue to be an important part of the NATO-led coalition’s campaign in Afghanistan. Beyond that, the system looks set to continue being a significant force multiplier for American operations in general, whether they’re against terrorists and militants or conventional opponents.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Russian military has denied that its combat aircraft intercepted Israel’s jets over Lebanon . The rumor emerged as the two countries appear to be looking for common ground on the situation in neighboring Syria and Iran’s presence in that country, but any Israeli deals with Russia could put them at odds with their key ally, the United States. On May 28, 2018, Israel’s “Hadashot” television news program reported that Russian Su-34 Fullback combat jets had driven off a pair of Israeli Air Force (IAF) F-16 fighter jets over the Lebanese city of Tripoli, citing Lebanese and Russian sources. Russia’s Ministry of Defense subsequently categorically disputed the story. Israeli officials have not commented on the matter. “Reports circulated by an Israeli news website about alleged ‘interception’ of two Israeli F-16 planes by Russian Su-34’s in the airspace over Lebanon are dilettantish nonsense,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement, according to state-run outlet TASS . “The Su-34 multirole bombers of the Russian taskforce in Syria are not used to intercept aerial targets and perform no missions in Lebanon’s airspace.” The claim appears to be based in part on unconfirmed video that circulated reportedly showing Su-34s flying over Lebanon. The clip did not show any Israeli aircraft and “Hadashot” suggested that the Russian aircraft could have been participating in a drill . This would make sense since still images appeared to show one of the Fullbacks carrying an anti-ship cruise missile and there were indications that the aircraft were actually offshore in the Eastern Mediterranean at the time. There’s no indication that Russia’s military aircraft have or would have any reason to just transit through Lebanese airspace. It is true that since the beginning of 2018, Israel has launched a significant number of airstrikes into Syria, including a massive operation against dozens of Iranian-operated sites, or those occupied by its proxies such as the Lebanese group Hezbollah earlier in May. In many cases, Israeli aircraft have flown into the country via Lebanese airspace or used it to launch stand-off attacks. Russian jets have transited over Lebanon, as well. More recently, the Israeli Air Force showed a picture of an F-35I Adir stealth fighter flying in the Eastern Mediterranean near the Lebanese capital Beirut. This picture, which subsequently leaked out to the public, accompanied a presentation in which IAF commander Major General Amikam Norkin announced the jets had flown their first combat missions . At the same time, Russia has made a number of outlandish claims and denials about its activities in Syria, as well as those of forces aligned with the country’s dictator Bashar Al Assad. In April 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defense insisted, without providing any actual evidence , that Syrian Air Defenders had knocked down 76 incoming cruise missiles during a combined U.S., British, and French missile barrage against chemical weapons sites in the country. But in this case, it is definitely reasonable questioning that the Russian contingent in Syria would commit its limited number of relatively advanced Su-34 strike aircraft to intercept Israeli jets over Lebanon. It also has a number of MiG-29SMT , Su-30SM , and Su-35S fighters at its Khmeimim outpost in Syria’s Latakia governorate, any which would be better suited to this task. A fully-armed Russian Su-30SM fighter jet takes off from Khmeimim., Ramil Sitdikov/Sputnik via AP In addition, so far, Russia has not used its planes or ground-based air defenses to challenge any Israel’s strikes into Syria. The two countries reportedly have a hotline to help deconflict their military activities in the region, similar to the one Russian and U.S. military personnel use for the same reasons. “We do not coordinate [with Russia],” a senior Israeli military officer said, according to The Times of Israel . “It’s about deconfliction and security measures, so they don’t harm us and we don’t harm them.” Most importantly, though, Israel and Russia appear to be growing their ties and making important deals over the future of the conflict in Syria. The same Israeli military official that spoke to The Times denied that the two countries are actively cooperating, but it is hard to see a number of recent developments, including alerting Russian officials to forthcoming strikes against Iranian targets, any other way. “Of course, the withdrawal of all non-Syrian forces must be carried out on a mutual basis, this should be a two-way street,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a press conference on May 28, 2018, in what appeared to be a statement pointed at both the United States and Iran. “The result of this work which should continue and is continuing should be a situation when representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic’s army stand at Syria’s border with Israel.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov., Sergey Pyatakov / Sputnik via AP This is not the first time Russia has suggested Iran should leave Syria. Earlier in May 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has had a number of meetings recently with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, made similar remarks . But separate reports suggested that this new statement was reflective of an actual agreement that Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman came to with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, earlier in May 2018. Under the arrangement, Israel would acquiesce to Assad reasserting his control all the way to the boundary with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in exchange for keeping Iran’s forces and Iranian-backed militias at least 35 miles away from the border. Israeli officials, including Lieberman and Netanyahu, have repeatedly stressed that their government sees the Iranian presence in Syria as unacceptable. It has also been readily apparent that Israel sees Iran as its chief security concern and that it is willing to take any steps necessary to challenge its expansion in the Middle East and elsewhere. The reported plan comes as reports continue to appear that point to increasing tensions between Russia and Iran over Syria. This makes sense given that Iranian actions have repeatedly prompted Israeli retaliatory strikes, which have in turn drawn in Assad’s air defense forces . The Kremlin has invested significantly in its own air and naval facilities in Syria, which it views as immensely strategic . The concern would be that Iran’s growing conflict with Israel could threaten Assad’s future and Russia’s ability to remain in the country. There is some indication that Syrian officials may be increasingly tired of being on the receiving end of Israeli strikes focused on Iranian interests, as well. Earlier in May 2018, a newspaper linked to Syrian opposition groups claimed that the Syrian Arab Air Force had demanded Iran and its proxies vacate its bases, which have repeatedly come under Israeli attack. For its part, Iran has publicly rebuked the Russians and noted that both countries are there at the behest of Assad’s regime. Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad has said it has no intention of forcing the Iranians out. “This topic is not even on the agenda of discussion, since it concerns the sovereignty of Syria,” Mekdad told Russia’s state-run outlet Sputnik on May 23, 2018. “We cannot let anyone even raise this issue.” Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad., CTK via AP Whatever the exact state of the triangular relationship between Syria, Russia, and Iran is at present, it is even more complicated in the overall context of the conflict in Syria. Specifically, any Israeli deals with Russian officials focused on containing Iranian interests could bring them into conflict with the United States and its other regional allies. The U.S. government, which is seeking to contain both Iran and Russia in the region and keep the pressure on Assad to either step aside or accept some sort of power-sharing agreement to end his country’s brutal civil war , is opposed to the regime in Damascus reasserting itself near the Israeli-Jordanian border. In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin agreed to a so-called neutral “de-escalation zone” in these areas to create a de facto ceasefire between American-backed Syrian rebel forces and pro-Assad elements. On May 25, 2018, the U.S. State Department issued an unusually strong statement that warned Assad and his partners against advancing into the border region in contravention of the de-escalation agreement. The remarks, attributed to the Department’s top spokesperson Heather Nauert, said the United States would pursue “firm and appropriate measures” if Assad went ahead with the reported planned offensive into the area and called on Russia to use its leverage over the Syrian government to dissuade it from doing so. Previous attempts by the United States to use Russia as a conduit to pressure the Syrians, or forces aligned with the government in Damascus, into changing their plans have been almost uniformly unsuccessful . Most notably, the U.S. military attempted to make use of a hotline to try and call off an attack by shadowy, Kremlin-linked Russian mercenaries and pro-Assad militiamen across the formal, but dubiously effective “deconfliction line” separating U.S. and Russian activities in Eastern Syria in February 2018. The officials on the other end insisted that those forces were not part of the Russian military and that they had no authority to order them to withdraw. American forces, and their predominantly Kurdish local Syrian partners, subsequently killed hundreds of mercenaries and militiamen in the ensuing counterattack , which involved air strikes and artillery fire. It’s not clear whether or not the U.S. government’s position on Assad’s forces returning to Southern Syria, or the Israeli-Russian deals that could facilitate that, has changed in part or in full since Nauert’s remarks earlier in May. The United States and Israel have made a number of moves to cement their own relationship as of late, including the immensely controversial decision to move the U.S. Embassy into the hotly contested city of Jerusalem. But if the U.S. military does come under threat from Syria’s forces, there is every indication that it will defend itself to the fullest extent possible. American troops near the Jordanian border have called in air strikes against advancing Iranian-backed militias in the past. Those aircraft have also shot down Iranian drones in the area. Pro-Assad militiamen in Eastern Syria in 2017., Михаил Алаеддин/Sputnik via AP If this happens, but Russia is unwilling to help to avoid a broader, direct conflict with the United States, Iran might rush to the aid of any pro-Assad troops. This, in turn, could lead to an Israeli response, which might precipitate a larger conflagration and a breakdown in various arrangements. On top of that, with so many different parties potentially operating in such a relatively small area, and doing so under different command structures and without immediate coordination between them, it’s not hard to see how there might be risks of unintended skirmishes. Fighting between Russian or Iranian forces and American personnel directly could have serious ramifications throughout the region and beyond. There is a remote possibility Russia’s growing ties with Israel, as well as its potential animosity toward Iran, could give the United States an incentive to try and improve its own relationship with the Kremlin as part of its push to isolate the regime in Tehran. Trump has often said he wished his administration could develop a better relationship with its counterparts in Moscow. US President Donald Trump, right, meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017., Sergey Guneev/Sputnik  via AP It’s not at all clear if the Trump administration could make this diplomatic push after pulling out of the controversial multi-national deal over Iran’s nuclear program. Russia has made clear that it continues to support the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and will continue to work to implement it with or without the United States. It’s almost certain that such rapprochement is politically untenable for a host of other reasons at present. These include Russia’s meddling in America’s electoral system and political discourse , as well as its outright threats and hostile actions against the United States and its allies . No matter what happens, it seems clear that, once again , the conflict in Syria looks to be getting even more complex and multi-faceted. The many competing agendas, as always , continue to have the potential to touch off a new and broader conflict where allies might find themselves pursuing competing objectives, even if they’re not fighting directly.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",British Army’s New Land Ceptor SAM System Blasts Its First Aerial Target,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The British Army’s Land Ceptor air defense system has completed its first successful live fire test. The U.K. Ministry of Defense says the weapon will offer a significant boost in capabilities over existing Rapier air defense systems and the live fire trials follow news that the naval variant, Sea Ceptor , has entered operational service with the Royal Navy. U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson revealed the test on May 28, 2018, but did not say when it had occurred. He said that event, which took place a Swedish test range on the Baltic Sea, evaluated the complete Land Ceptor system, which includes a truck-mounted launcher and two support vehicles. Video and images that the U.K. Ministry of Defense released show that the target in question was a Kratos BQM-167 drone . “In the face of intensifying threats, it is vital that our Armed Forces have the capabilities to keep Britain safe,” Williamson said on May 28, 2018. “Land Ceptor will be a formidable battlefield barrier, protecting our troops from strikes and enemy aircraft while on operations.” A product of the European missile consortium MBDA, the Land Ceptor missile itself, also known as the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM), uses a number of same components as the infrared-guided Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM). However, CAMM has a new active radar homing guidance system, as well as a two-way data link to improve accuracy. It is reportedly able to engage manned and unmanned aircraft, low-flying helicopters, and cruise missiles. In development since the late 2000s, a total of six countries, including the United Kingdom, have plans to adopt the weapon in its land- or sea-based configurations. There is also a larger, extended range version already in the works that will push the system’s maximum reach from more than 15 miles to over 25 miles. For the British Army, Land Ceptor will be a significant upgrade over the existing radar-assisted command-guided Rapier missiles , which can only engage targets a little more than five miles away. The U.K. Ministry of Defense says that the complete, networked air defense system will also be able to spot targets up to seven times further away thanks to its organic Saab Giraffe radar and Battlespace Management Command, Control, Compute, Communicate and Inform (BMC4I) system from Israeli defense contractor Rafael. A truck-mounted version of Saab’s Giraffe aerial surveillance radar. , Saab Rafeal’s BMC4I system is part of the larger Sky Saber air defense system, which is set to be a joint British Army-Royal Air Force arrangement. As part of this truly integrated air defense network, Land Ceptor units will be able to share and receive targeting data with each other, vastly extending their ability to spot and engage targets, even beyond the range of their organic Giraffe radars. In addition, the surface-to-air missile system will be linked to other sensor nodes, potentially including aircraft, further expanding the battlefield picture available to the operators of individual launchers. This will not only improve the ability of Land Ceptor to defend the British Isles, but could be especially useful for distributed operations in Europe or elsewhere. With the distributed network, the U.K. Ministry of Defense says that the surface-to-air missile system will be able to target up to eight separate threats at once, even if there are terrain obstacles, such as mountains or trees, in between. A trailer mounted Rapier air defense system in London ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Land Ceptor will replace these and others version of the system still in service., Crown Copyright The system’s air-transportable, road-mobile launch unit and supporting vehicles give it the option to redeploy relatively rapidly to respond to new threats in the midst of a crisis. According to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, Land Ceptor can arrive at a site and be ready for action within 20 minutes. In addition, earlier in May 2018, U.K. Defense Secretary Williamson also disclosed that the naval variant of the CAMM, known in the Royal Navy as the Sea Ceptor, was operational on that service’s Type 23 frigates . This weapon will also be an important feature of the future Type 26 frigates . It could also be an extremely valuable addition to the Queen Elizabeth -class carriers, which have dangerously limited air defense capabilities at present. The video below shows a test of Sea Ceptor from the Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose . It’s not clear whether or not Sky Saber will allow any information sharing between the sea-based and land-based systems and their associated sensors. For expeditionary operations, though, the United Kingdom could still deploy both versions to rapidly expand its air defense coverage, particularly in littoral environments. And while the U.K. Ministry of Defense has long-standing agreements to use test range facilities in Sweden, the evaluation on the Baltic still underscores the United Kingdom’s increasing need for Land Ceptor, even closer to home. The highly strategic and constrained waterway would likely be a flashpoint in any actual conflict with Russia, which has adopted an increasingly aggressive stance toward Western Europe and the NATO alliance, including the United Kingdom. The truck-mounted Land Ceptor launcher., MBDA In March 2018, tensions between the two countries soared to unprecedented levels after the attempted assassination of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter on British soil with a chemical weapon . Afterward, U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May implied her government might consider the incident a “ brazen act of war .” At that time, the U.K. Ministry of Defense had already stepped up engagements with the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all of whom are NATO members. It is easy to imagine future rotational deployments to the region could include Land Ceptor batteries. British Army troops in Estonia in January 2018., NATO The United Kingdom has also been working to expand its presence and engagement with allies and partners in the Pacific region . A readily deployable and highly networked air defense system would be valuable in a crisis in that environment, as well, where forces might find themselves arrayed in physically separated zones across a broad front. The “common” nature of the missile and launch canisters between Land Ceptor and Sea Ceptor will also help reduce strain on the logistics chain and keep costs down. The latter point will be especially important as the U.K. Ministry of Defense continues to face significant budget cuts amid an economic slowdown exacerbated by the United Kingdom’s plans to leave the European Union, also known as Brexit . Still, it looks as if Land Ceptor may be at risk of suffering delays. The British Army had expected to begin taking delivery of Land Ceptor systems in 2018, but it’s not clear if that is still the case. The U.K. Ministry of Defense says the full Sky Saber system is due to enter service in the early 2020s. Whatever the case, with only one successful test fire under its belt so far, the surface-to-air missile system will definitely need additional evaluations before its ready for active duty. But when it does arrive, it looks set to greatly increase the British Army’s air defense capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 27, 2021",America’s Newest Stealth Destroyer Has The Greatest Namesake To Live Up To,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On January 26th, 2019, the Zumwalt class destroyer USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) will be commissioned into Navy service. Like most fighting ships, its namesake will be woven into its unique culture. But DDG-1001’s name will be an especially powerful beacon of bravery and selflessness, and above all else, an example of commitment to one’s fellow teammates. Michael Monsoor’s life story is as complex as anyone’s, but how he ended up being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor really wasn’t. Before becoming a Navy SEAL, he was a kid from Long Beach that battled asthma. He overcame his condition by training in the pool and became an accomplished athlete, playing varsity football in High School. He enlisted in the Navy in 2001, but didn’t end up at Basic Underwater Demolition School (BUDS) until 2004. He graduated the grueling SEAL indoctrination program at the top of his class. As part of SEAL Team Three, he spent a lot of time in Iraq, as so many SEALs did. During this time there his penchant for bravery became abundantly clear even while operating among other SEAL legends like Chris Kyle. He earned the Silver Star for rescuing a wounded comrade by running out into a street-turned shooting gallery to save him. But his Medal of Honor came via a far greater sacrifice that occurred months later. His official Medal Of Honor citation reads: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as automatic weapons gunner for Naval Special Warfare Task Group Arabian Peninsula, in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM on 29 September 2006. As a member of a combined SEAL and Iraqi Army Sniper Overwatch Element, tasked with providing early warning and stand-off protection from a rooftop in an insurgent held sector of Ar Ramadi, Iraq, Petty Officer Monsoor distinguished himself by his exceptional bravery in the face of grave danger. In the early morning, insurgents prepared to execute a coordinated attack by reconnoitering the area around the element’s position. Element snipers thwarted the enemy’s initial attempt by eliminating two insurgents. The enemy continued to assault the element, engaging them with a rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire. As enemy activity increased, Petty Officer Monsoor took position with his machine gun between two teammates on an outcropping of the roof. While the SEALs vigilantly watched for enemy activity, an insurgent threw a hand grenade from an unseen location, which bounced off Petty Officer Monsoor’s chest and landed in front of him. Although only he could have escaped the blast, Petty Officer Monsoor chose instead to protect his teammates. Instantly and without regard for his own safety, he threw himself onto the grenade to absorb the force of the explosion with his body, saving the lives of his two teammates. By his undaunted courage, fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of certain death, Petty Officer Monsoor gallantly gave his life for his country, thereby reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Just think about Michael’s act for one second. In the middle of a firefight, on a rooftop, a grenade suddenly knocks on your chest, as if to introduce itself, and then lands at your feet. Every human instinct is to flee the weapon’s lethal blast, yet somehow, this man made the instant calculation that he could and should save his friends by sacrificing himself. The payoff is so non-instinctive—you won’t even be there to realize it—and the act is so final that’s it’s nearly incomprehensible how Monsoor could have come to such a snap and seemingly superhuman verdict. But somehow he did. Monsoor was absolutely beloved by his teammates and those he touched in his life. He had so much to live for, yet he instantly chose to sacrifice himself so that his friends could continue on. Sally Monsoor, in blue, sponsor of the future USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001), holds the christening bottle alongside the ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Scott Smith, her matrons of honor and Fred Harris, president of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, which built the Zumwalt class destroyer named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class (SEAL) Michael A. Monsoor., USN There really is no higher example of someone who gave more and who led by example than DDG-1001’s namesake, and that incredible spirit of heroism is what the crew of the USS Michael Monsoor will be called upon to live up to on a daily basis. A tall but exhilarating order for sailors young and old that will walk her decks and call her bunks home. The ship has been fittingly assigned the motto “I will defend” as that is exactly what Monsoor did with his last breath. It’s very easy to assume that the United States military gets its advantage through the technology it brings to the fight, but this is only a piece of the truth. It’s the soldier, airman, marine, and sailor and the long and proud legacy of heroism, love of country, and above all else, dedication to those they serve alongside that merges with that technology to provide the United States with an unparalleled fighting force. So on this Memorial Day, we want to thank Michael Monsoor and all the other heroes who have died in defense of our nation, many of which will never get a ship named after them or widespread recognition. But we also want to thank those who are still living, that possess many forms of bravery, and go out every day with great risk in one hand and love of their comrades and country in the other and do the nation’s hardest work so that we can enjoy the freedoms our constitution guarantees. You are loved.

That region is packed with American airpower, with NAS Pensacola, Eglin AFB, Tyndall AFB, and Hurlburt Field packed into a 100-mile arch. But being that it’s the Gulf Coast, all of those bases have intricate, multi-tier contingency plans for quickly readying for the worst weather disasters mother nature has to offer. This time around, many of the highly prized F-22 Raptors belonging to 325th Fighter Wing at Tyndall AFB are taking cover in a massive hangar on the installation. Stuffed inside that single hangar are 15 F-22s—roughly eight percent of the entire F-22 fleet—valued between about $3B and $5B depending on who you ask. Along with the F-22s are five gloss-black T-38A Talon trainers belonging to the 2nd Fighter Training Squadron. Tyndall AFB Facebook page These aircraft provide adversary support for Raptor pilots, including trainees—the wing includes the 43rd Fighter Squadron, which is the USAF’s sole F-22 training unit. The Raptor has an insatiable appetite for aerial targets as it is so efficient at doling out air-to-air death. So the wing has T-38s on hand to economically feed F-22 pilots with the high volumes of adversaries needed to challenge their skills. The 325th Fighter Wing also includes the 95th Fighter Squadron, which is a combat-coded unit , as well. The base posted the following alert yesterday in preparation for the storm: Due to updated forecasts for Subtropical Storm Alberto, Tyndall Air Force Base officials have declared HURCON 2. HURCON 2 means that damaging winds are a potential threat to Tyndall AFB in the next 24 hours. There will be no evacuation order for this subtropical storm. Tyndall AFB remains inside the National Hurricane Center’s storm track cone for Subtropical Storm Alberto. Tyndall AFB expects heavy rainfall, up to 7-9 inches. The forecast calls for tropical storm force winds (34 knots) to start at Tyndall AFB around 8:30 p.m. Sunday evening with peak winds possible up to 50 knots (gusting up to 60 knots) starting around 2 a.m. Monday morning. Forecasters expect the peak winds to last approximately 3-4 hours at Tyndall AFB depending on the exact storm track. Tyndall members should take the following precautions: Monitor local news for weather updates; check the Tyndall website and Facebook page. Brief family members on the situation. Clear yard of loose materials that could possibly turn into projectiles. Tyndall AFB Facebook page During more severe storms, any aircraft that can fly away to safer locales usually do . This can include sending the vast majority of an air base’s inventory into the air in a very short period of time and executing on all the logistics that are required to support them and their aircrews at their temporary home. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew and Hurricane Hermine sent Raptors of Langley AFB’s 1st Fighter Wing scurrying, resulting in some awesome images . Tyndall AFB is home to over three times the number of F-22s seen pictured stuffed inside that hangar, so we don’t know if the others were placed in other hangars on base or if they flew out to bases outside of the storm’s path. We also don’t know if all the QF-16s based there made it inside or if some were flown out as well.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",Special Operators Showed Off Their Abilities By Staging A Mock Battle In Tampa’s Harbor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In late Spring the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) kicks off in Tampa, Florida. Part of the festivities includes a large and rare public display of America’s special operations capabilities. The spectacle, which takes place on Tampa’s harbor, has grown increasingly complex over the years. It now includes assaults from multiple domains, opposition forces, hostage rescue scenarios, and thousands of blanks fired off as part of the mock battle. This year, from the air the MH-6M Little Bird and MH-60M Black Hawks were the stars of the show. An MC-130 also dropped in operators from on high. On the water, rigid-hull inflatable boats and SWCCs in their Special Operations Craft-Riverine take center stage. On the ground, Flyer-72s and MRZRs rush the bad guys to save a hostage—the Mayor of Tampa. And this demonstration isn’t just limited to U.S. military operators. Polish, Finish, and Colombian special operations forces, along with members of the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team and others can be seen working alongside their USSOCOM counterparts. Some may be surprised hearing the ripsaw sound of miniguns opening up in an urban setting here in the U.S., but one has to remember that Tampa has a deep connection with the special operations community. The United States Special Operations Command is headquartered at MacDill AFB that sits in the center of Tampa Bay, and the region is stacked with key military installations, many of which have direct ties to the special operations mission. It’s also an opportunity not just to show off to convention goers what the U.S. and its allies bring to the table when it comes to special operations, but also to let the public see and appreciate what they do. Above that, it’s training. The stress of a crowd can be a powerful factor, especially when it comes to executing an intricately timed and complex operation in a confined space like this. And it’s not like special operators don’t already train in big cities around the United States, but in those cases, the public isn’t exactly invited to get a clear view of the operation. Youtube Screencap These types of special operations demonstrations are commonplace in many other countries, with the Middle East taking a special affinity to them, and some are far more over the top than the one in Tampa. Earlier in the month, Jordan held its own special operations convention known as SOFEX along with the 10th annual International Warrior Competition. During these events, Jordan executed demonstrations at its ‘Disneyland-like’ training compound , the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center (KASOTC) and at King Abdullah II Air Base. The air base demo included the use of a three-sided, multi-story ‘doll house’ close-quarters battle set, which was quite a novel addition. With the importance of special operations forces growing around the globe, these demonstrations will only become more elaborate with each passing year.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 19, 2018",Russia’s Su-57 Fighter Launches A New Cruise Missile From Its Weapons Bay,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has presented video of the country’s new Su-57 fighter—you can read our full analysis on this often misunderstood aircraft here —launching a new cruise missile from its internal weapons bay. This is the first video we know of not only of this missile being tested, but also of the Su-57s weapons bays in use. In his statement , Shoigu mentions the Russian Ministry of Defense’s large effort to test and evaluate new weapons on the Syrian battlefield, but it’s not clear if this launch took place over the war-torn country or not. He says the test occurred in February, which is the same month a pair of Su-57s briefly deployed to Syria under puzzling circumstances. That excursion lasted less than two days and what the aircraft were doing there and why they returned home so quickly remains a mystery. It is possible that the Su-57s were there to test the missile on real targets, or the test could have just as easily occurred on ranges within Russia’s own borders. The missile being launched appears to be the Kh-59MK2, a standoff weapon designed especially for the Su-57 and the confines of its two ventral weapons bays. The subsonic cruise missile has a modular, rectangular design that incorporates some stealthy features and coatings. It navigates using INS with embedded GPS (GLONASS/Navstar). An infrared seeker is used for terminal homing, allowing it to hit moving targets, have its final point of impact fine-tuned for maximum effect, or to be retargeted in real-time. The ability to loiter over a target area is another possibility based on the capabilities of similar designs. A two-way data-link provides man-in-the-loop control between the missile and the launching aircraft all the way till impact. It would also be capable of hitting targets autonomously, at least stationary ones, albeit without the exacting precision that man-in-the-loop control provides. Range and payload estimates vary widely, but it’s likely to be able to reach targets at least 150 miles away while carrying a 500lb warhead. The modular nature of the design may allow for multiple configurations, such as larger fuel sections to be swapped for smaller warhead sections. But basically this thing is something between Israel’s Delilah and the U.S. Navy’s SLAM-ER. Kh-59MK2 displayed at MAKS 2015, Vitaly V. Kuzmin /Wikicommons The missile will provide the fledgling Su-57 with a critical standoff attack capability, allowing it to stay far enough away from threatening air defense systems to remain undetected while still being able to attack them, or any targets under their protective umbrella. The use of an infrared seeker also puts maritime targets at risk. I have already written at length about how the Su-57’s weapons menu is being creatively tailored to overcome some of its most apparent weaknesses , and seeing the Kh-59MK2 enter the testing phase so early in the Su-57s career certainly supports that narrative. The entire video of Shoigu’s statement can be seen below, with the Su-57 segment beginning at time index 5:30: If it works as intended, the weapon and its derivatives will also be a highly attractive export product for Russia’s defense-industrial apparatus, and it’s not as if a Su-57 is required to put it to use. Operators of modern Flanker and Fulcrum variants are likely to find its capabilities very attractive as well and Russia could incorporate it onto other platforms once it is operational such as the Su-30/34/35. The big question is will Russia actually buy them in substantial numbers. If Syria has taught us anything, Russia still relies heavily on dumb bombs and unguided rockets for the vast majority of its aerial combat punch. But at least for the Su-57, of which there are less than a dozen in existence nearly a decade after it was first unveiled, the Kh-59MK2 will provide the jet with some serious standoff precision strike capabilities.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 29, 2018",The USAF Has Added Large Multi-Function Cockpit Displays To Its F-15C Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the F-15C’s known shortfalls is its dated cockpit, which includes a spattering of ‘steam’ gauges, radar scope, radar warning receiver display, and a small color multi-function display. Compared to fighters built even in the latter 1980s, it’s archaic. Now it has come to our attention that the USAF has been upgrading their F-15C Eagle’s with a large multi-function display that slots in where the F-15C’s engine instruments and radar warning receiver were installed. This little talked about enhancement is known as the Passive Attack Display, or PAD. The Fighter Bomber Directorate at Robins AFB told The War Zone that the upgrade coincided with the introduction of the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod to the greater F-15C/D community around 2015. The Sniper integration program for the F-15C is named the Passive Attack Sensor System (PASS). Designed primarily for strike fighters to surveil and target objects on the ground, the Sniper pod has since migrated to the B-1 and B-52 bomber communities with great success and is largely seen as the standard for targeting pods the world over. The system packs a mid-wave FLIR, HD television camera, laser spot tracker, laser designator, onboard DVR, and a video data-link. But its greatest assets to the F-15C are its powerful zoom capabilities and its high definition. Around the turn of the decade, the pod was seen as a possible solution to the F-15C’s long-range aerial target identification shortfall. The F-15C/D fleet has non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) capabilities that utilize the aircraft’s radar to identify and classify the unique signature of the targeted aircraft, but these methods are in no way totally reliable, or in some cases, even available depending on a large set of factors. Sniper targeting pod on the F-15C’s centerline station., 142nd FW/USAF Even with the ability to kill other aircraft from dozens of miles away, and increasingly capable identification friend or foe (IFF) systems, visual identification has remained the standard rule of engagement for most combat environments over the last few decades. But that doesn’t mean the naked eye literally has to see the target by looking out the window. In fact, over the decades, some F-15 units have attached hunting rifle scopes next to their HUDs in an effort to provide some sort of long-range visual identification capability. The Eagle’s Naval counterpart for many decades, the F-14 Tomcat, had a Television Camera Set (TCS) system that was designed specifically for target identification beyond visual range. It was limited to about a ten miles against fighter-sized targets and substantially longer against bombers, making it usable for AIM-7 Sparrow shots. The need to visually ID targets as quickly as possible and at night is especially crucial for F-15Cs sitting alert in the United States. Air National Guard F-15C/D units are arrayed around all of America’s maritime borders, with units in Massachusetts, Florida, Louisiana, California, and Oregon. F-15s sitting alert are called on to intercept all types of targets, in all weather conditions, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These targets include everything from wayward light aircraft, to troubled airliners, to aircraft threatening the President’s security , to more ‘exotic’ targets of interest . Being able to ID a target sooner than with the naked eye can mean the difference between a failed or successful enemy attack, and increases situational awareness dramatically not just for Eagle pilots in the air, but also for controllers on the ground that are managing the intercept. It was the Florida Air National Guard’s 125th Fight Wing that pioneered the Sniper pod concept, deeply testing it and devising tactics associated with it before the rest of the F-15C fleet began receiving the $1.6M pods. To our best knowledge, before the PAD was introduced, a tablet was used to display the pod’s imagery, which was a workable, but far from an ideal setup. Lockheed The pod locks onto aerial targets primarily by slaving its optics to the aircraft’s radar. It can also be manually steered, or cued by the pilot’s Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems (JHMCS), and has a secondary aerial search function that provides something akin to a ‘poor man’s’ infrared search and track (IRST) functionality. Keep in mind that the Sniper pod is in no way a worthy analog for an actual IRST, which can rapidly detect multiple targets at far greater ranges with its longer wavelength infrared optics. IRSTs can also provide an array of search and track functions, including the ability to provide targeting data for beyond visual range engagements, which can be a huge advantage . IRSTs can have visual imaging capabilities as well, but not with the high fidelity or versatility of the Sniper pod. You can read all about IRSTs, their capabilities, and the tactics that go along with them in this past special feature of mine. The F-15C is also slated to receive an IRST which will come in the form of Lockheed’s IRST21 encased in the company’s Legion Pod, or to a smaller degree, the Talon Hate pod . Lockheed Beyond using the Sniper pod just for long-range identification, it can also be used in the non-traditional information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (NTISR) role to rapidly gather data on ground targets. For the Air National Guard, this means that local F-15s can be scrambled during an emergency to begin collecting reconnaissance imagery, including full-motion video, of a particular site or an area. This could be especially useful following a natural disaster, when critical infrastructure fails, or during a terrorist attack. The setup can even be used for drug interdiction efforts. The F-15C’s cockpit without the new Passive Attack Display PAD. The small multi-function display in the bottom left of the cockpit has was upgraded to color some time ago. This display, which deals with weapons management and situational, awareness among other tasks, still exists on PAD upgraded jets., DoD By 2015, the Sniper pod was arriving in full force at other F-15C units and today the capability is widespread and has regularly deployed overseas with the Eagles. At the same time, the Passive Attack Display program was getting underway. The introduction of the Sniper pod is just one part of the so-called “Golden Eagle” upgrade path which looks to keep around 179 frontline F-15Cs tactically relevant for years to come. With its new and hugely powerful APG-63V3 AESA radar , Link 16 data-link connectivity, Sniper targeting pod, Advance Display Core Processor (ADCP) II, and more upgrades to come including the aforementioned infrared search and track system, conveying so much information to the pilot in such a dated cockpit is a major problem. The Eagle’s PAD., IEE This is where the Passive Attack Display comes in. It gives the Eagle Driver a 9X11 inch night vision compatible, color multi-function display screen with a resolution of 1024X768. It can show multiple video channels and instrumentation feeds, including a number of them at one time, via multiple windows. It also can overlay instrumentation or tactical data on a video feed. You can read the complete RFP for the system here . IEE who makes the display describes it as such: “The PAD uses an ARINC 818 fiber optic interface to receive video from, and exchange messages with the ADCP II. The ADCP II facilitates the centralization of a number of critical display functions, such as the consolidation of multi-window configurations into one complete screen image for distribution to display units. This addresses the need for the ever-increasing amount of information available to operators to improve situational awareness. The F15-PAD upgrade features twelve programmable discreet interfaces, each of which can be provisioned by the ADCP II to three different types of inputs and outputs. These discreets can be used for other aircraft functions, giving the PAD a built-in service life extension.” Today, the PAD primarily provides a big display for checking out the Sniper’s video feed, monitoring the Eagle’s engines, and displaying Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) information. Some of the video layouts available on the PAD. , PAD RFP There was also a planned upgrade to replace the Eagle’s RWR and obsolete AN/ALQ-135 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) that would have provided a quantum leap in combat capability and survivability for the Cold War era jet. The Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) is able to geolocate threat emitters and use various electronic warfare tactics to counter them, allowing the F-15 to penetrate through contested airspace. The system would need to display this info in a situational manner and would have also taken good advantage of this new display, but EPAWSS was recently put on indefinite hold for the F-15C, with just the F-15E Strike Eagle fleet now slated to receive it. Currently, the air superiority Eagle has a somewhat precarious place in the USAF’s arsenal. There is a roadmap being implemented that will see the jet serve well into the 2040s and even beyond, but the flying force still isn’t sure just how long it wants to keep it around, and as a result, how much it wants to invest in it. Some of the jets will need new wings beginning in the mid 2020s. This is an expensive proposition but one that could see the aircraft last for decades longer if executed. Replacement of the notoriously problematic longeron structural beams that run along the F-15’s canopy rails is already underway. But if the USAF really plans on keeping the jet in service into the middle of the century then other upgrades like EPAWSS will be essential. USAF The possibility of retiring the entire F-15C/D fleet and replacing it with upgraded F-16s has been floated by the USAF brass. The recent increase in defense spending and the establishment of a multi-year defense spending bill has certainly helped to abate such a decision from being made at this time. But in the not so distant future, the Air Force will have to come to a verdict as to the F-15C/D’s fate one way or another because pouring large sums of money into upgrading an aircraft you may soon retire is clearly a wasteful proposition. If the mighty Eagle is blessed by the USAF with decades of additional service, an entirely new cockpit layout may be in order. This, along with a new low-profile heads-up display, already exists , with Qatar being the first country to field it in their new-build F-15QAs. In the meantime, Eagle Drivers can finally enjoy more screen area to work with in their cockpits via the Passive Attack Display. A special thanks to the public affairs office at Robins AFB for their help in identifying the PAD and understanding its origins.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 18, 2019",Russia’s S-500 Air Defense System Reportedly Hits Target Nearly 300 Miles Away,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has reportedly conducted the longest range surface-to-air missile test ever with its S-500. If and when it becomes operational, the air and missile defense system could significantly increase the Russian military’s anti-access and area denial capabilities in Europe , East Asia, and elsewhere , but its already years behind schedule. CNBC was first to report on the development, citing unnamed sources familiar with U.S. intelligence on the Russian program, but its story did not say when the launch occurred. According to the anonymous individuals, the S-500 was able to hit a target just shy of 300 miles away, which is some 50 miles further than the previous record. The stated range of the existing S-400 system when using the 40N6 missile is almost 250 miles. Though the system, also known as the Triumfator-M or Prometheus, has been in active development since at least 2009, there are few firm details about its capabilities. Russian media has reported in the past that the final production S-500s will be able to engage opponents up to 370 miles away . Depending on the exact missile type the launcher carries, it will supposedly be able to shoot-down both air-breathing targets, including manned aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missiles. The latter capability appears to be the most immediately important to the Russians and many reports indicate that the road-mobile S-500 is likely to act primarily as a more flexible and survivable replacement, or at least supplement , for Russia’s fixed, silo-based A-135 anti-ballistic missile system. The S-500s would otherwise supplement existing S-400 surface-to-air missile systems and provide theater ballistic missile defense and other long-range capabilities as necessary. The air and missile defense system would also compliment the still-in-development A-235 ballistic missile defense system, which is another road-mobile system that reportedly is actually primarily an anti-satellite weapon . S-500s would be ideal for providing regional ballistic missile defense along Russia’s European borders with NATO. It is in many ways roughly analogous to the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD , though the goal is clearly to offer flexibility to respond to more conventional aerial threats, as well. It is also possible that there could eventually be a naval version that would give future Russian warships a ballistic missile defense capability. Two of the new missiles for the S-500, the 77N6-N and 77N6-N1, will reportedly be capable of mid-course intercepts against ballistic missiles, with broad performance similar to the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system using the SM-3 interceptor on some Arleigh Burke -class destroyers. The video below is of a test of a Russian silo-based anti-ballistic missile system. The Kremlin could see a significant new impetus for pushing ahead with the S-500 since the United States has been openly talking about the possibility of new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles , as well as new, long-range ground-based missile and rocket artillery systems . The U.S. military says these systems necessary to meet various emerging security concerns, but especially those coming from Russia as a result of its increasingly assertive foreign policy. In addition, the Russian military might see S-500 as essential to defending its eastern flank, particularly against any potential Chinese intrusions. China is notably not limited by the provisions of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF , which Russia is party to with the United States. As such, China has developed a large array of medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles with both conventional and nuclear payloads, as well as special maneuverable variants that can engage moving naval targets . Of course, the United States has accused Russia of violating the INF itself with a nuclear-capable ground-launched cruise missile . Chinese DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles., Imaginechina via AP There are reports that the S-500 will be able to able to shoot down hypersonic missiles, but it is unclear whether or not this refers to ballistic missiles in their terminal phase of flight or missiles cruising at hypersonic velocities, such as boost-glide vehicles or air-breathing hypersonic cruise missiles . Missile manufacturer Almaz-Antey has also claimed the system will be able to shoot down stealth aircraft, such as the U.S. F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter – a claim that the Kremlin has made about the S-300 and S-400 , too – but that capability would be reliant on the ability of the associated radars to detect and track low-observable targets. The CNBC report does not say what radars or other sensors were used in the latest long-range test. At present, it is understood that the 91N6E(M) S-band acquisition radar, 96L6-TsP C-band acquisition radar, 76T6 multi-mode engagement radar , and 77T6 anti-ballistic missile engagement radar are all parts of the S-500 system, but it’s unclear if this is the full suite of associated systems or how they necessary function together. Components of the S-500 system., Almaz-Antey via Army Recognition With these sensors, Almaz-Antey says the complete S-500 system will be able to perform more traditional air defense functions at extreme ranges, as well. Reports have pointed to Russian interest in potentially being able to use the weapons to shoot down combat support aircraft , such as the American E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, which are already facing the potential need to operate further and further from the front lines in the face of improving integrated air defenses. All told, even if the versions of the S-500 that eventually enter service have more limited target engagement capabilities than Almaz-Antey has claimed so far, with a maximum range of nearly 300 miles, the system will still present a considerable threat in a traditional air defense role, especially when layered together with S-400s and other systems. Depending on the range and capabilities of the associated radars, if the Kremlin put the missiles in its Kaliningrad enclave , the range ring would cover the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as much of Poland, all of which are NATO members. Most of the Baltic Sea would be within range, too. Place additional systems in Ukraine’s Crimea region , which Russia is illegally occupying, could present a significant challenge for forces operating in the Black Sea. And Russian forces in Syria could dramatically expand their air defense coverage with S-500s, as well, since the country is only about 450-miles long diagonally. From the Kremlin’s Syrian outpost at Khmeimim , SAM operators could have the range to hit targets as far away as northern Israel, Jordan, and western Iraq. In Russia’s Far East, S-500 batteries could easily be within range of South Korea and Japan. Being able to challenge the latter country might be another important option for the Russians, who dispute control over portions of the Kuril Islands , which separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the North Pacific Ocean. But while the reported S-500 long-range test would definitely be a significant milestone in the program, without knowing when it occurred, what parameters were, and whether it reflects other testing successes, it’s hard to say how close the system might be to becoming operational. As of 2016 , the Russian military was reportedly considering purchasing at least five complete batteries and have them in service by 2020. Trailer-mouned erector launchers associated with the S-400 surface-to-air missile system, which Russia could deploy together with the S-500s., Vitaly Kuzmin However, in 2009 , Almaz-Antey had expected they could at least roll out the first models by 2012. By 2013 , this had slipped to 2017 and the next year got pushed back to 2018 . The Russian military has yet to announce it has taken delivery of any production S-500s. The potential for foreign sales might help push the program along now, though. Just in the last 18 months, Almaz-Antey has seen an explosion of interest in the existing S-400 system and the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles could make S-500 attractive to various countries. Even China, which is likely part of the reason why Russia development the system in the first place could be a customer. The country just received its first batch of S-400s in April 2018 and has a clear interest itself in anti-ballistic missile defense . And with help from the Russian government in pitching it to allies and partners, the system could be a real competitor to other air and ballistic missile defense systems on the market. American defense contractors Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have also recently secured new sales of their Patriot PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) and THAAD systems respectively. Unfortunately, the Russian missile maker might find itself the victim of its own success. The plant that makes the S-400 will be churning out weapons to fulfill existing orders through at least 2025. It’s unclear where Almaz-Antey plans to build the S-500s. It seems hard to imagine that the company would not have accounted for the demands of future S-500 production, at least to some degree. Still, the surge in demand for the S-400 could have upended those projections. Regardless, both the Russian government and Almaz-Antey remain committed to the program. If the reported test is any indication, the system’s exact features and capabilities are likely to be of great interest to potential partners and opponents alike when it finally makes it debut.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 16, 2018",Trump’s Sudden Cancellation Of The North Korean Summit Is A Stupendous Blunder,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. I have repeatedly lauded Donald Trump for being ready and willing to talk directly with Kim Jong Un going back to the early stages of his Presidential campaign. Now, less than three months after the President giddily accepted Kim Jong Un’s request for direct talks, and the brief but dramatic thawing of tensions that followed, the President has decided to pull out of the summit via a bizarrely worded letter that lacks substantial justification. The move is a massive strategic and diplomatic misstep and makes the U.S. look weak and untrustworthy, not the opposite. Here is the letter in full: White House The tone of the letter is beyond strange and it is largely self-contradicting. It’s collegial, calling Kim by his official party moniker, and thanking him for the negotiations leading up to the summit. It goes on to say that Trump was looking forward to being at the planned June 12th and meeting with Kim. Then it says the reasoning behind pulling out of the meeting is because of the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement.” Although North Korea had threatened to pull out of the talks over military exercises in South Korea, it was regarded as no big deal by the White House at the time. The statement the President is referring to comes from vice-foreign minister Choe Son Hui and was originally posted by North’s official Korean Central News Agency: At an interview with Fox News on May 21, US Vice-President Pence made unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya, military option for North Korea never came off the table, the US needs complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, and so on. As a person involved in the US affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the US vice-president. If he is vice-president of “single superpower” as is in name, it will be proper for him to know even a little bit about the current state of global affairs and to sense to a certain degree the trends in dialogue and the climate of détente. We could surmise more than enough what a political dummy he is as he is trying to compare the DPRK, a nuclear weapon state, to Libya that had simply installed a few items of equipment and fiddled around with them. Soon after the White House National Security Adviser Bolton made the reckless remarks, Vice-President Pence has again spat out nonsense that the DPRK would follow in Libya’s footstep. It is to be underlined, however, that in order not to follow in Libya’s footstep, we paid a heavy price to build up our powerful and reliable strength that can defend ourselves and safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the region. In view of the remarks of the US high-ranking politicians who have not yet woken up to this stark reality and compare the DPRK to Libya that met a tragic fate, I come to think that they know too little about us. To borrow their words, we can also make the US taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined up to now. Before making such reckless threatening remarks without knowing exactly who he is facing, Pence should have seriously considered the terrible consequences of his words. It is the US who has asked for dialogue, but now it is misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us. I only wonder what is the ulterior motive behind its move and what is it the US has calculated to gain from that. We will neither beg the US for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us. Whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States. In case the US offends against our goodwill and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the DPRK-US summit. This is hardly a blistering response in North Korean terms. And it actually is right to point out that Trump’s own staff, namely National Security Advisor Bolton and Vice President Pence, stupidly went about comparing North Korea to Libya during such a sensitive time. Trump even had to walk back Bolton’s remarks about how the North Korea deal would be modeled on the Libya deal , which clearly didn’t protect the North African dictator as he ended up dying dramatically after being pulled from a drainage culvert in Sirte after weeks of U.S. and allied bombing: I warned about Bolton’s ultra-hawk stance and notoriously big mouth and how he is a major threat to a North Korean nuclear deal when Trump selected him to replace H.R. McMaster months ago. Overall it’s telling that Trump seems to think that just because both sides agreed to talk that they still aren’t enemies and don’t have massive differences to work out—which is the whole reason for the talks in the first place. This isn’t that surprising sadly as Trump has a history of valuing superficial overtures, platitudes, and personal relationships more than concrete results. Above all else, Choe Son Hui’s statement is a reminder that North Korea has no intention of instantly denuclearizing . The Pentagon itself has concluded as much, and why would they? Especially considering the deal the White House had in mind was for ‘security assurances’ and possibly opening up the country to some U.S. private investment. This is hardly a ‘best shot’ deal full of incentives for North Korea to move down the denuclearization path and to normalize relations with its neighbors. Considering Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement, America’s assurances now mean nothing . How on earth the President didn’t understand this before constantly setting expectations so high is and has been baffling to watch as this crisis has progressed. Now, because he can’t get total and instant capitulation from Pyongyang, it looks like he isn’t interested in a more realistic alternative of gradual denuclearization and slowly ushering North Korea into the international community. And shutting down North Korea’s nuclear program could never happen in an instant anyway. It would take years and a large-scale inspection and verification regime to see it through to its end. NSA John Bolton in the Oval Office., AP But regardless of the motive behind pulling out, doing so makes the United States look totally inconsistent and not that interested in peace. The summit should have been used to present North Korea with the very best deal possible, one full of dramatic carrots and sticks, and backed by other key players in the region. Assurances and the possibility of some U.S. private sector investment sometime in the future is hardly a gleaming offer. All this takes focus, planning, diplomacy, and the spending of political capital, which really doesn’t seem to have occurred in the weeks leading up to the historic meeting. If Kim decides not to take such a deal, or even worse—doesn’t show up—then the U.S. and its allies would have a real case for taking other routes, and military action is certainly one of them. Basically, by walking away from a highly attractive, internationally-backed ‘best shot’ deal, North Korea would fall on their own sword, and at least we could say we literally tried everything before going down a military route. Instead, the U.S. is the petulant child here. We are the thin-skinned ones who walk away the second the other party doesn’t act like our best buddy. Considering we are talking about a reclusive military state largely built on the threat of American military force, such little tolerance on behalf of the Trump administration makes it appear as they had no real intention of showing up at the talks in the first place. The President and the First Lady greet three Americans that were held captive in North Korea and relaeased as a sign of goodwill., AP And it was North Korea who released three prisoners into U.S. custody and who shut down its nuclear site, although the utility of that site to the regime is now next to nothing. But it’s still a gesture. North Korea also met with their South Korean counterparts on multiple occasions, including the historic meeting between Kim and Moon at the DMZ. And these diplomatic exchanges have also been a rocky road, but who on earth would have thought this would be easy or smooth sailing in any form? Don’t throw “Art Of The Deal” out and claim Trump is a master negotiator. Maybe in business, but when it comes to running a government there is little evidence to support such a claim. Quite the opposite actually. Even if the meeting comes to pass, Trump’s strange surprise letter and his willingness to pull out of such a critical summit damages America’s credibility in so many ways. Trump and Moon met just days ago at the White House, but this decision took Moon by surprise. , AP South Korea, which has the most at stake in all of this, certainly was blindsided by Trump’s move and it will only work to draw divide the two allies. It’s impossible to believe that President Moon agrees with canceling the Summit over a reactionary and somewhat measured response to the Trump administration’s own gaffs is a good idea. In fact, he has already commented on the news, saying : “I am very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-U.S. summit will not be held on June 12 when it was scheduled to be held.” What’s even stranger is that Trump’s letter says that if Kim changes his mind about the summit he should call or write. But Kim didn’t make the decision to pull out, Trump did. It goes on to say how big of a missed opportunity this is and how canceling it is detrimental to the world, but once again, Trump is the one making the very decision he is lamenting. In the letter, Trump once again compares North Korea’s nuclear capabilities to those of the United States—an odd addition and another bizarre tone change in the strange declaration. China is also likely factoring into this. After a meeting between Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un earlier in the month, North Korea pulled out of a meeting with South Korea and began to state more clearly that it didn’t intend to instantly denuclearize. Just before Trump released this letter, the U.S. disinvited China from its biennial Rim Of The Pacific multi-national naval wargames. The reasoning behind that decision, according to the Pentagon, is China’s actions in the South China Sea—one of the most sensitive international topics for Beijing. But nothing has really changed in regards to China’s posturing there in recent days. Trump also tweeted three days ago that China may be allowing sanctioned goods to flow over the border with North Korea. Ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. and China have also been less than constructive . Kim has met with now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on two occassions, and indicated conditions were looking good for the upcoming summit., AP So it’s very possible that Trump came to the realization that pretty much everyone else already had—Chinese President Xi Jinping is not his buddy and will leverage China’s power anyway it can to check U.S. advances in the region—possibly including forestalling a much tighter U.S.—North Korean relationship. Nobody knows what will happen next. Maybe the summit will be rescheduled, but this is another sign of an erratic and petty Commander In Chief supported by an increasingly hawkish and counter-productive group of characters, as well as a White House that has proven itself incapable of controlling its messaging even when doing so is most critical. And all of this has major consequences. Just as the President stated himself, this is a missed opportunity and sad moment in history—one that he willingly chose to make happen and will be responsible for.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Watch One Of Russia’s Newest Ballistic Missile Subs Launch A Rare Four Missile Salvo,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia has released video of the Borei -class ballistic missile submarine Yuri Dolgoruky rippling off four Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles during a recent training exercise. The impressive and very public demonstration of the boat’s capabilities comes as Russia is pushing with plans to significantly modernize its nuclear arsenal and as the country has stepped up its undersea activities to levels not seen since the Cold War. Yuri Dolgorukiy fired the Bulavas , also known as the RSM-56 or SS-N-32, while submerged in the White Sea on May 22, 2018. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense , the missiles all successfully hit their designated targets at the Kura range on the Kamchatka Peninsula some 3,500 miles away in Russia’s Far East. This was the first time Borei -class sub had ever fired a salvo of missiles. At present, Russia has three Boreis , also known as Project 955s. Yuri Dolgorukiy is the only one assigned to the country’s Northern Fleet , with the other two boats being part of the Pacific Fleet . Each one can carry up to 16 Bulavas, each of which is a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) design. The missiles carry six warheads and reportedly also have a large number of decoys to help penetrate through missile defenses . The salvo test is an important milestone for both the Borei -class and the Bulava, both of which have suffered delays and other difficulties. Russian ship-builder Sevmash laid down the Yuri Dolgorukiy ’s hull in 1996, but didn’t actually launch the boat for nearly a decade. The Kremlin only commissioned her in 2013 when the Bulava, which also had a development program dating to the 1990s, finally entered service. Between 2004 and 2009, the missile suffered five failures in 11 tests, which led to a significant redesign of the weapon. Even since officially becoming operational, at least one RSM-56 has failed and another one may have also malfunctioned . During a test in September 2016, Russian personnel used a command self-destruct feature to destroy another one of the missiles in mid-air as it was apparently flying off target. The Borei program has continued to suffer its own continued troubles, as well. Between 2012 and 2016, Sevmash laid down another five boats with an improved design, known as the Project 955A or Borei-A , with structural improvements, further noise reduction features to reduce the likelihood of detection and improve its survivability, and updates to the crew’s living conditions. So far, however, the shipyard has only launched one of these additional submarines and did so just recently in December 2017. The Kremlin hopes to have them all in service by 2020 and says it is buying another batch of six Borei-A s , which will be operational in 2023. The Project 955 Borei -class submarine Alexander Nevsky , Russian MoD That latter decision came after officials in Moscow scrapped plans for a further improved design, the Project 955B or Borei-B , after it reportedly proved to be too expensive and complex . These proposed ships would have included a quiet pump-jet propulsion system . “After the analysis of proposals on building Borei-B nuclear-powered submarines, a decision was made to give them up as the project of building these subs does not meet the ‘cost/efficiency’ criterion,” an unnamed Russian defense industry source told state-run outlet TASS earlier in May 2018 . “Instead, the final version of the state armament program through 2027 includes Borei-A submarines.” As it stands now, Russia is hoping to eventually have a fleet of at least 14 Boreis . These will reportedly serve primarily as replacements for the aging Cold War-era Project 667 Delta III – and IV -class ballistic missile submarines that remain in service in both the Northern and Pacific Fleets. With this in mind, the new Boreis are an important part of the Kremlin’s plans to reinvigorate the country’s strategic deterrent capabilities. There are already indications that Russia’s existing ballistic and cruise missile-armed submarine fleets have begun conducting more regular deterrent patrols. At the same time, in 2017, there is information that suggests Russia has significantly reduced those sorties in the Pacific. “A total of 102 voyages by surface ships and submarines are scheduled for this year,” Russian President Vladimir Putin declared earlier in May 2018. “It is essential to enhance the naval component of the strategic nuclear force. This will increase the role of the Navy in nuclear deterrence,” he added. The Russian Navy has stepped up submarine activity in general as part of the country’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy. For years now, both U.S. military and NATO alliance officials have publicly commented on the uptick in missions. Russia pursued “an extraordinary investment path not mirrored by the West” with regards to submarines and made “technology leaps that are remarkable,” as well as improved professionalism and overall capabilities of its submariners, U.K. Royal Navy Vice-Admiral Clive Johnstone, head of NATO’s Allied Maritime Command, told Jane’s 360 in 2016. “I think none of that would worry us if we knew what the game plans were or we knew why they were deploying or what they are doing.” One of the regions where this surge in naval sorties has been particularly pronounced is the Arctic , where Russia is dramatically expanding its military posture as a whole. In April 2018, the Russian Navy’s new Ilya Muromets icebreaker escorted Yuri Dolgorukiy through the ice in the White Sea, which is situated very close to the Arctic Circle. The icebreaker Ilya Muromets. , Russian MoD The Russians “are deploying more [submarines] and they are deploying at a higher rate,” U.S. Army General Curtis Scaparrotti, head of U.S. European Command, told members of Congress more recently in March 2018. “The [Russian Navy] forces they are deploying are being modernized, particularly with their weapons systems.” At present, NATO is looking to re-establish a dedicated Joint Force Command for the Atlantic and the U.S. Navy is working to reform its 2nd Fleet to better oversee operations in the northeastern end of that ocean. Both of these moves are linked to rising Russian naval activity, especially with regards to submarines. “This is a dynamic response to the dynamic security environment,” U.S. Navy Admiral John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, said during a ceremony on May 4, 2018. “So as we’ve seen this great power competition emerge, the Atlantic Ocean is as dynamic a theater as any and particular the North Atlantic, so as we consider high-end naval warfare, fighting in the Atlantic, that will be the 2nd Fleet’s responsibility.” But as is always the case with Russian military modernization efforts, serious questions remain about the ability for Russia to actually pursue its plans with regards to the Boreis . Sevmash has not shown any capacity to churn out more than one of the submarines per year, at best. Prince Vladimir , the first Project 955A was originally supposed to enter service in 2017 , a delivery schedule that first slipped to 2018 and is now set for some time in 2019 . A Russian submarine under construction at Sevmash., Marina Lystseva/TASS In addition, the Borei-As will be competing for funding with a host of other new and improved strategic weapon systems, including plans for nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed undersea drone , as the Kremlin’s defense spending appears to be contracting under the weight of international sanctions and the low price of oil. Russia has already halted work on one new ballistic missile specifically to shift resources to a nuclear-armed hypersonic boost-glide vehicle program. A lack of funding also killed plans to reboot its rail-mobile ballistic missile capability. Without adequate resources, the Kremlin may have no option but to accept that the Boreis will arrive at a much slower pace than it desires. The total planned size of the fleet could shrink, too. This is to say nothing of the costs to operate and maintain the submarines or train their crews. In January 2018, a fire broke out at Russia’s submarine base in Vladivostok, which the Kremlin claimed was actually a training exercise . Still, Yuri Dolgoruky ’s has now further demonstrated that the Borei -class has the potential to offer a very real boost in capability for the Russian Navy. This might help ensure the program remains a priority over other more exotic strategic weapon developments.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 2, 2018",Photos Surface Of Elusive U.S. Special Operations Mothership In Seychelles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Before last week, it had been three years since MV Ocean Trader— the highly customized roll-on, roll-off freighter that was converted into a mothership and floating command center by U.S. Special Operations Command—had been photographed. That picture was taken while it was still being retrofitted for its highly specialized and shadowy mission at the soon to be defunct BAE Systems shipyards in Mobile, Alabama. Then, last Friday, The War Zone discovered a new picture of the finished vessel, taken at a remote drydock facility in Oman. Now more photos have come to light, these ones offering us our first good glimpse of the vessel’s massive hangar bays and reworked superstructure. The photos, which were posted on French defense journalist Philippe Chapleau’s blog , were taken on February 27th, 2018, nearly two months after the picture was taken in Oman. The location is also important, with these photos being snapped in Victoria, on Mahé Island, the capital city of the Seychelles Archipelago. Via Philippe Chapleau/ lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr Via Philippe Chapleau/ lignesdedefense.blogs.ouest-france.fr The images show a number of the ship’s unique features. In particular its huge hangar doors, which are markedly larger than those found on most U.S. Navy vessels. They seem to be more than spacious enough to easily accommodate the largest special operations helicopters in U.S. service—most notably the MH-47 and CV-22 —and they could also likely fit a CH-53E Super Stallion as well. Also clearly visible are the large apertures installed along the ship’s starboard side that can launch and recover boats and other special operations craft stored inside the Ocean Trader’s multi-level garage-like cargo hold. Additionally, we get a clearer view of the vessel’s elaborate communications suite with multiple satellite domes dotting its upper superstructure. Finally, just like in the last photo, a .50 caliber machine gun station can be seen on the upper deck, this time near the vessel’s bow. The location of the stealthily named MV Ocean Trader in recent months also points to its operating current area—the Arabian Sea. The vessel was built for low-intensity conflicts and supporting special operations missions, making hotspots like Somalia an ideal area for targeted operations. The ship is also uniquely suited for counter-piracy operations around the Horn of Africa as it was specifically procured and modified not to appear like a combat ship. In essence, it is the bait and the trap all in one. Supporting special operations forces in Yemen and interdicting illicit cargo heading from Iran to Houthi fighters in that country is also another possibility. Considering it has called on ports in Oman and Seychelles, it’s probable that it also calls Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean home from time to time. The Naval Support Facility there can accommodate the ship, and there aren’t any curious onlookers to deal with. Military Sealift Command, which is a principal participant in the program, has a large footprint there, with nearly a dozen prepositioning ships assigned to Diego Garcia’s lagoon. We will keep you updated as to where this ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’ of a combat vessel turns up next.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Here Is Boeing’s Master Plan For The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet’s Future,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing is pushing ahead with the Block III F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program for the U.S. Navy, which includes new build aircraft and upgraded planes , and will significantly enhance the lifespan and capabilities of the jets. At the same time, there are no formal plans to upgrade the fighter’s engines or add conformal fuel tanks to the service’s EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft , which could limit Carrier Air Wings’ ability to take full advantage of the added capabilities. On May 23, 2018, Boeing hosted a media day at its offices in Washington, D.C. to provide the latest updates on the program’s status. According to its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year and associated documentation, the Navy intends to purchase 110 new F/A-18E/F aircraft in the Block III configuration over a four year period. The service also plans to upgrade at least a portion of its 540 existing Super Hornets to the new standard as part of a service life modification program, or SLM, that will run through at least 2025. Boeing says it will deliver two test jets to the Navy in 2019 ahead of the first of the new production aircraft, which will begin arriving between 2020 and 2021. The service expects to begin using the Block III Super Hornet operationally by 2022 and hopes to have the equivalent of one squadron of the aircraft for each of its nine Carrier Air Wings by 2024. The goal is for there to be two squadrons of the jets per Carrier Air Wing by 2027. “Super Hornet – 100 percent of the striking force of the Carrier Air Wing today,” Dan Gillian, vice president of Boeing’s F/A-18 program, said during his press briefing. “There is no retirement date for the Block III Super Hornet.” An artist’s conception of a Block III F/A-18F Super Hornet., Boeing At present, the Navy plans to fly a mix of these jets and F-35Cs for the foreseeable future. The Block III configuration is supposed to ensure the Super Hornets can operate together with the stealthy Joint Strike Fighters in high-end conflicts as threats to the Carrier Air Wing and the aircraft carriers themselves continue to grow. All of the new Block III Super Hornets will have a lifespan of at least 9,000 flight hours, which is fifty percent greater than that of earlier F/A-18E/F aircraft. The SLM program will extend the life of existing jets out to the same total flight hours. On top of this, the final versions of the new and upgraded F/A-18E/Fs will feature five major upgrades. These are conformal fuel tanks , a networked infrared search and track (IRST) capability, physical changes and coatings to reduce the radar signature of the aircraft, new mission computers and data links, and a new, single wide-area multi-function display in the cockpit. An overview of the Block III Super Hornet’s new features., Boeing The conformal fuel tanks, or CFTs , which Boeing in developing in cooperation with Northrop Grumman, are an extremely important addition to the aircraft in their own right. At their most basic, they extend the range of the Super Hornet and free up underwing space for more ordnance or other stores. The two CFTs hold slightly less fuel than a pair of 330-gallon drop tanks, but the added aerodynamic efficiency of the arrangement makes up for this, according to Gillian. The new tanks will extend the Block III Super Hornet’s range by between 100 and 120 miles on average, depending on the jet’s exact loadout. “Also, not having those draggy drop tanks lets you go faster,” Gillian said. “Speed and range come with the conformal fuel tanks, which is critical when you think about the future fight and needing to extend the range of the Carrier Air Wing.” Gillian added that previous testing with Boeing designed-CFTs during the Advanced Super Hornet program in 2013 had shown that the kinematics remain effectively the same between aircraft with and without the tanks and that there does not appear to be any significant loss of maneuverability with the added feature. The company plans to flight test this existing older design in combination with other Block III upgrades in the near future as a risk-reduction measure. A close-up of the infographic showing difference in ranges between existing Super Hornets and aircraft in the Block III configuration with CFTs when carrying various different kinds of weapons, including the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon , or JSOW., Boeing Unfortunately, new engines for the F/A-18E/F and the EA-18G, another addition that could help build on the added efficiency the CFTs offer, are absent from the Block III program. It remains unclear when and if the Navy might pursue this further upgrade project, which has been under consideration in one form or another since at least 2013. General Electric has in the past and continues to propose an improved variant of the Super Hornet’s existing F414 engine . Previous “Enhanced Durability” and “Enhanced Performance” concepts featured new fan and compressor components that would variously improve lifespan and performance. The F414-EPE type reportedly offered a 20 percent boost in thrust. Details about the F414-EPE engine., General Electric The Navy did include $15 million for research and development into a Super Hornet engine upgrade in its unfunded priorities list for the 2019 fiscal year. However, this is a wishlist the service sends annually to Congress in the hopes lawmakers will allocate additional funds for various projects. It’s also unclear whether the Navy plans to add CFTs to the EA-18G fleet or include those aircraft in any potential engine upgrades. The Growlers have to carry around jamming pods on their underwing pylons in lieu of drop tanks in order to perform their mission. As such, the CFTs would be even more essential to extending their range. Adding in more powerful or efficient engines would also be a boon for the aircraft given how generally burdensome their standard loadout is. Those electronic warfare platforms are only likely to become more critical as time goes on, especially with regards to potential high-end conflict scenarios, and you can read more about their specific jamming and electronic attack capabilities here . But without these updates they might not be able to accompany strike packages of Block III Super Hornets out to their full combat range, reducing the overall effectiveness of the force. An EA-18G Growler., USN The CFTs won’t even be available when the Navy gets its first of the new jets. Boeing says they will be ready by the time the aircraft begin flying operational missions in 2022, according to information the company gave at the media day event. There was no specific mention of what Block III Super Hornet updates might or might not find their way into the Growler in the future or when that might occur. The company was keen to stress that the complete upgrade package would greatly improve the F/A-18E/F’s survivability and capabilities within the Carrier Air Wing as it exists now and as it transforms in the future with the addition of the F-35 and other new systems. The exact nature of the Block III’s stealthy airframe enchantments remains unclear. Boeing’s Gillian did mention “simple treatments and coatings” to help reduce the aircraft’s radar cross-section, but did not offer any additional specifics. In the past, he has said these changes could reduce the radar signature of the jets by as much as 10 percent . There are no plans to give Navy’s new and upgraded jets a fully enclosed weapons pod that could further improve the Super Hornet’s low-observable characteristics. Boeing had previously proposed this system as part of the Super Hornet International Roadmap and the Advanced Super Hornet concept. Boeing’s older Advanced Super Hornet concept, showing the enclosed weapons pod in the centerline position., Boeing The infrared search and track system (IRST), already in development as part of the earlier Block II upgrade, will give the advanced fourth generation aircraft an additional means to detect hostile low-observable aircraft at long distances. In addition, coupled with the new Distributed Targeting Processor-Networked (DTP-N) and Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) data link, multiple jets will be able to fuse data from these sensors, as well as others, to form what Boeing and the Navy call a “common tactical picture,” or CTP. A single Block III Super Hornet will be able to passively scan with the IRST, spot targets, and present the pilot with a rough bearing overlaid on the aircraft’s radar screen. The sensor-fuzed CTP allows two or more aircraft to not only get a bearing on an opponent, but determine their range and altitude. Boeing says this data will be accurate enough to create three-dimensional target tracks and allow F/A-18E/F crews to actually engage their opponents at extended ranges. A briefing slide giving the basics of the Common Tactical Picture concept., Boeing The company declined to say how far out the IRST, which the Super Hornets will carry in the front of a modified drop tank, will be able to identify targets. Separately, U.S. Navy Captain David Kindley, the F/A-18 program manager at Naval Air Systems Command, who was also on hand, said the modular nature of the sensor would allow jets to fly with it only as necessary. “This airplane as it sits looks very much like a high-end air-to-air type fight[er] – God forbid we should be in that place, but that’s kind of what this airplane is designed for,” Kindley said, referring to a model of the Block III Super Hornet next to him at the time. “Tomorrow, if we go to a different place, this is an external tank that can be replaced by a no-kidding external tank that without the first third of it is an IRST. We can put smart air-to-ground ordnance on the aircraft and it can be in a different role.” A graphic showing the IRST concept for the Super Hornet that combines Lockheed Martin’s IRST21 sensor and an associated environmental control unit from Meggitt Defense Industry fitted to the front of a GE Aviation FPU-13 drop tank., Lockheed Martin Though Gillian and Kindley did not make the case directly, the implication here is clearly that the F/A-18E/F Block III aircraft will give the Carrier Air Wing a cost-effective alternative to the F-35C in low-end conflicts, such as Iraq and Syria. At the same time, though, it will offer a complementary capability of higher end fights against potential near-peer adversaries, such as Russia or China. To further enhance this flexibility, in addition to the DTP-N and TTNT systems, the Block III aircraft will also have an updated satellite communications system, another hold-over from the Block II program. Information from the aircraft’s own sensors and mission systems, as well as the data it receives from other sources, will feed into different displays on a single 10-inch by 19-inch flat panel touch screen that replaces the existing multi-function displays. The completely redesigned cockpit architecture, known as the Advanced Cockpit System, will also include additional backup displays and manual buttons in case this single screen fails in part or in full. Dual seat F/A-18Fs will have this functionality in both the front and rear cockpits. A briefing slide describing the features of the ACS., Boeing Boeing says it has already been testing the glass cockpit systems in both physical and simulated formats and that it has solicited feedback from various Navy aviators, including elite pilots from the service’s famous Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, more commonly known as Topgun. The goal is to have a new user interface that is intuitive and will require as little change to existing training regimens as possible. Boeing also has other cockpit updates in the works adjacent, but separate to the Block III program, including three-dimensional tonal audio warnings. This means a pilot will not only receive an auditory warning about a potential or incoming threat, but will hear the tone coming from the direction it’s coming from. There has also been some investigation into the possibility of adding voice commands to various systems inside the jets, but so the sheer volume of noise inside the cockpit of a modern fighter jet has been a major limiting factor. The company hopes that all of the Navy’s Block III program and its other associated improvements to the aircraft will make Super Hornet an increasingly attractive option for foreign buyers, as well. Most recently, Boeing finalized a deal to supply 22 F/A-18Es and six F/A-18Fs to Kuwait. A Kuwaiti F/A-18C Hornet., DOD Though Boeing’s Gillian couldn’t say what systems they would have in common with the Navy’s future aircraft, he did say there was some overlap with the Block III jets. In addition, these will be most advanced versions of the aircraft to date when they roll off the production line. That contract also serves as a bridge to keep the production line hot between the Navy’s most recent orders and those that the service expects to place with funds it receives for the 2019 fiscal year. Beyond that, Boeing says it is either actively competing for bids or is otherwise in discussions with eight other countries over potential Super Hornet or Growler sales. The biggest potential buyer would be India , which is running tenders for new fighter jets for both its Air Force and Navy, with the former service looking to buy more than 100 new aircraft. In addition, Boeing has announced it could join together with Indian firms Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Mahindra Defense Systems to manufacture the jets in the country if it wins the contract. We overheard in the lobby ahead of the media day that representatives from the Indian embassy would be arriving later in the day for briefings on Super Hornet. Other possible customers could include Bulgaria, Canada , Finland , Germany , Japan, Poland, and Switzerland. According to Gillian, Japan has only expressed a preliminary interesting in the EA-18G , though. A map showing countries that Boeing hopes to sell Super Hornets or Growlers to in the future. So far, only Kuwait has committed to purchase any jets., Boeing A number of these competitions are already controversial, however, and may not come to pass in their current form at all. The Indian Air Force is now on the third iteration of its fighter jet replacement program and Boeing almost ended up cut out of the Canadian competition, a saga unto itself , after a trade dispute . As it stands now, the Navy remains the primary Super Hornet customer and is set to operate the jets for years to come. Whether its commitments to the program expand beyond where they are now, such as adding new engines to the jets or adding conformal fuel tanks to its EA-18Gs, remain to be seen.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but a U.S. Air Force T-38C Talon training jet has crashed near Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi. It is the second crash of one of the service’s aircraft in May 2018 and the latest in a spike of serious accidents across the U.S. military’s aviation communities. The mishap occurred around 8:30 AM local time in Mississippi on May 23, 2018, with the jet reportedly coming down near the border between Lowndes and Monroe Counties. Initial reports are that the jet’s two crew members ejected successfully and were undergoing a medical evaluation. The Air Force said first responders had successfully extinguished a resulting fire and that there were no structures near the crash site. Though the first reports did not say what unit the aircraft was from, Columbus Air Force Base is home to the 14th Flying Training Wing . The Wing’s 49th and 50th Flying Training Squadrons both operate the T-38 and the units are cleared to fly training missions across a number of designated areas around the base. The Air Force has now lost five aircraft in non-combat accidents so far in 2018, compared to only seven such crashes in all of 2017. Before this incident, a WC-130H from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard crashed in Georgia , killing all nine individuals on board. It is also the second T-38 crash specifically in the space of six months. In November 2017 , a Talon from the 87th Flying Training Squadron at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas crashed, killing the pilot. There have also been additional incidents across the other services in 2018, which include crashes of both fixed wing and rotary wing types . Altogether, U.S. military aviation mishaps have claimed the lives of more than two dozen U.S. military personnel so far this year. A map showing approved airspace for T-38 operations around Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, at the center of the circle at the low right, as of 2016., USAF On May 9, 2018, in a session to add and remove provisions from the latest draft version of the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year, the formal title for the annual defense budget, the House Armed Services Committee unanimously approved the inclusion of a provision calling for an independent military aviation safety commission. The proposed eight-member panel would review historical mishap data compared with a more recent increase in incidents starting in 2013 and make recommendations as necessary for changes in “safety, training, maintenance, personnel, or other policies,” according to the draft bill’s language. Top Pentagon officials and senior leaders across the services insist that there is not a “crisis” in military aviation and that each mishap involves a unique set of factors. “No one should deny this is a problem, no one should delay fixing the problem, and part of the responsibility is on our shoulders. There’s are all sort of issues, damage that’s been done at a variety of levels,” Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said during the markup session.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 11, 2018",Israeli-Made Bolt-On Kit Turns 122mm ‘Grad’ Artillery Rockets Into Precision Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israeli defense contractor Rafael is working on an add-on upgrade package, known as the Electro-Optical Precision Integration Kit, or EPIK, that could turn any Soviet-standard 122mm Grad artillery rocket into a precision-guided round capable of hitting stationary or moving targets. The company says that it hopes to further develop the system to work with other unguided surface-to-surface weapons, potentially offering a relatively simple and low-cost way for military forces around the world to significantly expand their longer-range precision fire support capabilities. Jane’s 360 was first to report on the EPIK development earlier in May 2018. Rafael said it had waited until it reached the technology demonstration phase of the program, which came after the test firing of multiple experimental rockets equipped with the guidance system, to disclose the project. The Israeli government-owned company did not say if it had any prospective customers lined up already or when it expected the first production rounds would be available. “A considerable number of ground forces have unguided surface-to-surface rockets in their inventories – these have a high circular error probable – meaning they don’t hit the target precisely, they hit around it, ” Gal Papier, the head of Marketing and Business Development for Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ Precision Tactical Weapons Systems division, told Jane’s. “Consequently, over the past two years we’ve leveraged that technology to inform development of the EPIK concept to address growing demands from ground forces for a solution that can engage autonomously, in multiple areas and hit multiple targets, with precision, simultaneously.” EPIK consists of a multi-mode sensor package and moving control surfaces that attach to the front of the rocket. It has infrared and laser sensors and an inertial navigation system (INS) with embedded GPS, which allows the round to engage a wide variety of targets, including moving vehicles. Russian BM-21 Grads, one of the most ubiquitous types of 122mm multiple rocket launchers, which remain in service in dozens of countries. Rafael says the first versions of EPIK will be for this caliber of artillery rockets., Vitaly Kuzmin Rafael did not specifically say whether or not the complete weapon system had a man-in-the-loop targeting capability , but it is a possibility. The guidance system is a derivative of the systems the company developed for SPICE – standing for Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective – a family of precision-guided aerial bombs , which has this capability. Man-in-the-loop type systems are also increasingly a hallmark of Israeli precision-guided munitions in general . What this means is that an actual person can maneuver the round in its terminal phase of flight, helping to improve accuracy to an extreme degree. This also provides opportunities to engage enemy forces that are trying to relocate as the rocket is hurtling toward the target area or shift the point of impact to avoid innocent civilians or other collateral damage that might only become apparent at the last moment. However, the need for a two-way data link could easily limit how far away an EPIK-equipped rocket might be able to make use of this capability. A 122mm round might be moving too fast to effectively make use of it at all, too. The INS can either help direct the weapon to the general target area or engage specific stationary targets in a fire-and-forget mode. According to Rafael, the guidance package has scene-matching and signal-processing capabilities that could allow a rocket with EPIK to autonomously zero in on specific areas of interest, too. Especially notable, Papier stressed to Jane’s that the GPS component of the guidance system is a backup only, with the other sensors and INS acting as the primary means of directing the rocket. Combined with the man-in-the-loop capability, this could make EPIK effective even in a GPS-denied environment , which an increasingly realistic possibility on modern battlefields . It’s not clear whether EPIK requires any modification to the rocket’s warhead or if it will only work with certain types. Papier implied that it required minimum effort to add the kit onto existing rounds and said that simplicity would make it a relatively easy proposition to integrate the system onto almost any other artillery rocket system. “We’ve now completed risk mitigation of the process of installing the add-on kit on a rocket – primarily with the 122mm Grad surface-to-surface rocket,” he explained. “We can add EPIK to any caliber of unguided surface-to-surface effector [weapon system] that has a motor and warhead.” 160mm rocket pods on the back of an Israeli-made Lynx truck-mounted multiple rocket launcher. This system would be a good future candidate for further EPIK development., Natan Flayer via Wikimedia Depending on how much it costs to add the guidance kit to each rocket, and what additional equipment needs to go into the launch platform to employ the guided rounds, EPIK could see world-wide appeal just as an option for the 122mm rocket and nothing more. First developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s and commonly known Grad , or “hail,” this standardized rocket artillery caliber remains immensely popular with different types of rounds with various warheads and range capabilities still in production in more than dozen countries. The rockets have proven to be such a durable weapon system that Israel employs its own variants , while also defending against attacks from terrorists and militants using their own versions of the rockets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=dPIuzGSMAkg The predominant type of warhead is a high-explosive fragmentation type best suited to engaging troops and light vehicles in the open. There are also various cluster munition types available. Depending on the warhead and motor, the rockets can have ranges anywhere between eight and 25 miles. Serbian firm EDePro claims that its newest G-2000 type has the longest range of any presently available 122mm round at over 30 miles. There are various launchers in service with various countries mounted on wheeled and tracked chassis, as well as improvised and production man-portable systems. One of the most common configurations is a 40-round launcher on the back of a 6×6 truck, typically referred to by the Russian nomenclature BM-21. By far the most extreme variation on the concept is a semi-trailer-mounted system from the UAE with 240 tubes arranged in four individual arrays of 60 tubes each. The 122mm round is so popular, though, that EPIK isn’t even the only guided option Israeli firms are developing for the launchers. In 2017, Israel Military Industries (IMI), another state-run enterprise, unveiled the AccuLAR-122 , a derivative of the 160mm AccuLAR-160, with LAR standing for “light artillery rocket” in both cases. Unlike Rafael’s guidance system, this round only has GPS-assisted INS guidance. An IMI Lynx fires an AccuLAR-160 rocket., Ronite via Wikimedia IMI said it had developed the complete weapon system, mounted on an air-transportable 6×6 tactical truck, in response to demands from the country’s special operations forces for highly mobile and accurate fire support during operations when they might find themselves separated from traditional artillery and air support. The same logic would apply to conventional forces conducting expeditionary or distributed operations especially in regions, such as the Pacific, where forces might be fighting along a front stretching hundreds of miles that include specific areas that may be physically separated from each other by vast bodies of water or other natural obstacles. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps have actually already conclusively demonstrated the viability of the basic concept by attaching conventional rocket artillery units with the 227mm High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ), which is also truck-mounted, to special operations elements in countries such as Iraq , Syria , and Afghanistan . In these cases, HIMARS offers a much more responsive long-range fire support weapon that is also accurate enough to engage specific individuals and other small targets during limited operations. EPIK would be an even more flexible option, possibly even using its moving target capabilities to engage small ships, boats, and watercraft in a littoral environment. The ability of the rockets to independently and autonomously find targets would allow a single launcher to engage a swarm of boats , too. In the hotly disputed South China Sea region , Vietnam has already deployed Israeli-made EXTRA GPS/INS guided artillery rockets to areas under its control in order to challenge fixed Chinese positions on neighboring islands. Combining them with EPIK-equipped 122mm systems could dramatically expand the country’s ability to threaten China’s activities in the region and would serve as a model that other countries in the region, or in more constrained environments elsewhere in the world , might be inclined to follow. A US Marine Corps HIMARS launcher., USMC And as Papier noted, operators of 122mm rocket launchers have stockpiles of unguided rounds already and it would likely be more cost-effective to convert that some or all of it than to buy entirely new ammunition. We’ve already seen how effective blending an add-on guidance system to existing warheads and rocket motors can be with the air-launched 70mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II, or APKWS II , which is in increasingly widespread use in the U.S. military and elsewhere . As such, EPIK could easily be even more of a force multiplier for existing launchers than something like the AccuLAR-122, both during special operations missions or conventional activities. With both EPIK-equipped and regular unguided rounds on hand, units could quickly switch ammunition types to launch saturation attacks against massed conventional forces, as well. In that vein, Israel has actually adopted the AccuLAR-122, but as an option for its M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). These heavy tracked launchers typically fire the same 227mm rounds as the HIMARS, or a single quasi-ballistic missile, but can fire the smaller rockets – in guided or unguided form – using a special, modular pod. An Israeli M270 MLRS with a 160mm rocket pod installed on the left and the normal six-round 227mm pod on the right. The 122mm pod is similar to the 160mm one., Bukvoed via Wikimedia This could expand the number of countries who might be interested in a 122mm guided rocket, even if only as a low-cost alternative to 227mm rounds in either the MLRS or HIMARS systems. HIMARS, in particular, has gained significant notoriety from its combat performance in Iraq and Syria with NATO members Poland and Romania now looking to be among the newest international operators. Both of those countries are former Warsaw Pact members and longtime users of 122mm weapons. They likely still have significant stocks of those rockets, which might remain useful rounds for their HIMARS using a combination of an appropriate pod and a guidance kit such as EPIK. A Romanian LAROM multiple rocket launcher which can fire 122mm rockets, as seen here, or 160mm types., DoloresRKT via Wikimedia Any of the dozens of existing 122mm rocket launcher operators could be just as interested in EPIK, though. If Rafael can keep the conversions simple and the costs down, they’ll already have a large potential market before even having to consider expanding into other calibers.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2018",Detailed Official Report On Harrowing Encounter Between F/A-18s and UFO Surfaces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though the 2004 encounter between an unidentified flying object nicknamed the ‘Tic Tac’ and U.S. Navy Hornets made headline news last Winter via its associated with a secretive Pentagon program to investigate UFO encounters, and possibly much more , the story had been talked about in detail among military aviation circles for years . But now we have an official report that came out of the aforementioned Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program (AATIP) that makes a number of conclusions based on its findings. Above all else, it offers far more granular detail about the now historic incident than what had previously been released. The document comes to us via George Knapp’s intrepid I-Team, which is part of Las Vegas CBS affiliate Channel 8’s Newsroom. You can and should read it in its entirety by clicking here. Knapp’s team explains how they obtained the document in their article, stating: “Earlier this year, we made a whirlwind trip to Washington for a debriefing arranged by former Senator Harry Reid. While in D.C., the I-Team obtained copies of unclassified documents related to the UFO encounters, including the Tic Tac. The analysis was compiled in 2009 with input from multiple agencies. It confirms the Nimitz group had several interactions with AAV’s, Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.” The 13-page report isn’t dated and lacks a cover sheet, but it provides a rich recounting of the encounter, with a clear accounting of the assets and sensors involved, and how the Navy handled the incident administratively in its aftermath. The supercarrier USS Nimitz , the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Princeton , E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft, and F/A-18C Hornets and F/A-18F Super Hornets were all involved with the incident. Other ships that were also part of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group were also likely involved but to a lesser degree. But maybe what’s most important is that it really wasn’t just an incident, the report states that the objects were detected over six days, from November 10 to the November 16th, 2004. Intermittent radar detection of a number of objects near the strike group as it plowed the waters off of the Baja Peninsula showed fantastic agility. They dropped from 60,000 feet down to just above the water in a number of seconds and hovered there before zooming off “high velocities and turn rates.” USS Princeton as seen in 2003. The vessel packs the Aegis combat system and its SPY-1 radar, which combined represent the most capable maritime anti-air warfare system in the world. , USN Yet even with an arsenal of the most powerful air defense sensors and combat systems in the world, the objects were impossible to continuously track. The report does note that if the USS Princeton, which acts as the nerve center for the carrier strike group’s air warfare mission, was in ballistic missile tracking mode it may have been able to better track the objects as the filters that throw out clutter not indicative of an air-breathing threat would not be active. Visual Contact Over nearly a week, three separate events related to the mystery targets occurred, but on November 14th the phenomenon went from electronic to highly tangible. It started out around 10:00AM local time with the Princeton, callsign POISON, asking an E-2C orbiting high overhead to use its powerful AN/APS-145 radar to look-down and attempt to paint a target in a particular piece of sky that the ship was tracking. At first, it looked like just a wave on the E-2 crew’s scopes, but it turned out to be a very faint target with no velocity indication. The Princeton asked to take control of a pair of F/A-18F Super Hornets belonging to VFA-41, callsign FASTEAGLE 01, the E-2 was directing as part of a training mission. Controllers on the ship wanted to vector them to the ghost-like target in an attempt to get a better handle on what these strange radar returns were. The jets were only armed with captive training missiles. What the pilots saw as they came within about a mile of the target was a white, featureless object—no wings, engines, control surfaces, or surface features—that measured roughly 45 feet long and looked like a flying Tic Tac. Commander David “Sex” Fravor, the commanding officer of VFA-41 and the pilot in the lead Super Hornet that day, noted that the outer shell of the craft looked like a “whiteboard.” The object was low over the water which was frothing underneath. According to Fravor, it looked almost like the water was “boiling” below the object, which was moving above the water “like a Harrier.” It then started moving at about 500 knots at 500 to 1,000 feet over the ocean. USN The Super Hornet’s own AN/APG-73 radar couldn’t detect the object even at close range. The pilots relied on a Link16 target track—presumably from the USS Princeton— to help them arrive at the target. They even tried making a ‘helmet lock’—using their Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System ( JHMCS ) to slew the jet’s sensors onto the target—but it didn’t work. The aircraft did not have a targeting pod mounted on it at the time of the event. Fravor’s then tried to intercept the Tic Tac by diving down toward it but “it appeared to recognize” him and took evasive action. Eventually, it pulled into the vertical and shot away at supersonic speed. The pilots asked the Princeton if they had the object still on their radar, and they replied “picture clean” meaning no unknown radar contacts appearing on their scopes. Then moments later they chimed back in stating “you’re not going to believe this, it’s back at your CAP!” The object hadn’t just shot away at blistering speed, it actually returned to where the Super Hornets were on station performing a practice combat air patrol before the incident began. When the pilots returned to the ship they were questioned about their jets and their operability—they were brand new with less than 100 hours on them and worked perfectly according to the pilots. They were also asked if they had experienced any physiological issues during the flight, which they hadn’t. USN Word of the incident got around the carrier fast and personnel in CVIC (the aircraft carrier’s intelligence center) donned tin-foil caps to greet the pilots as they showed up to debrief their UFO encounter and didn’t take it seriously at first. The Super Hornet crews were not asked to sign any unique paperwork or non-disclosure agreements. The report also noted that the crews were constantly ridiculed over the weeks that followed. Fravor has since gone on the record regarding the incident and describes his memory of it: Another Hornet During the same period of time, another jet, this time an F/A-18C from the VMFA-232, was on a check flight from the ship after undergoing maintenance when controllers asked the pilot if the unarmed fighter had any weapons onboard—not a normal question while doing training off the western seaboard—and vectored the aircraft to an unknown target. The previously mentioned pair of VFA-41 Super Hornets that actually saw the object were also heading toward the target to investigate at this time. Upon arriving in the target area, the Marine Hornet pilot didn’t see the white craft, but he did spot a big disturbance on the ocean’s surface roughly 150 to 300 feet in diameter. The pilot noted that seas around this foaming area were calm. USN As the pilot left the scene he could see that the disturbance was dissipating. Upon debriefing with intelligence personnel, he was asked if he ever saw the “supersonic Tik Tak.” He reported that he didn’t. But the strange water phenomenon happened near where the Super Hornets were chasing the object and had just witnessed the “boiling” sea underneath it before it darted off. VFA-41 Super Hornets v. Tic Tac Round Two Another Super Hornet flight from VFA-41 launched after FASTEAGLE01 landed. By then it was roughly 3 PM. The crews exchanged information in the paraloft where they suit-up and suit-down before and after missions with the hopes that the second flight would also spot the object on their training mission. Once airborne and setup on station, the tracks of identified craft began to appear via the Super Hornet’s Link16 data-link terminal at roughly 30-40 miles south of their position. They could get only intermittent and faint radar returns while searching for the object with their own radar. The report describes the crew’s attempts to track the target in technical detail: Tic Tac Report Eventually, the crew was able to spot the target on with their ATFLIR targeting pod. After landing, the Super Hornet crew noted they could not confirm that this was the exact same thing the FASTEAGLE01 had seen as they never obtained a visual on it. The FLIR video captured that day has since become its own cultural phenomenon. Overall, the report really paints a picture of how this was a larger event that impacted more people in some way than what most realize. It included three separate flights of aircraft, all of which observed the phenomenon in different ways. What came after the aerial encounters is also of significant importance. When Commander Fravor, the lead Super Hornet pilot from the primary intercept, debriefed with the Carrier Air Wing’s lead intelligence officer, they didn’t know what to do with the information. If the pilot wasn’t a Commander, squadron CO, and generally highly regarded it likely would have been given even less weight according to the report. Related Video – Airliners And F-15s Involved In Bizarre Encounter With Mystery Aircraft Over Oregon: Eventually, the account and the FLIR video were sent to the captain of 3rd Fleet Intelligence, where it supposedly met a dead-end. The Captain in charge there thought it needed no further investigation because happened during training at home and he thought it “was part of a counter-drug operation based on the area of operations.” The reluctance to look deeper into the incident, at least officially, seemed to be true within the upper echelons of the Carrier Strike Group itself. But the report also makes an interesting note of just how incredible this encounter actually was, and how quickly any known investigation into it died: Tic Tac Report Another interesting aspect of this paper is that it mentions the USS Louisville (SSN-724) , a Los Angeles class nuclear fast attack submarine that was also operating alongside the Nimitz . It makes note that the submarine didn’t detect any unusual acoustic information or other anomalies during this whole event, even considering the churning water the craft seemed to cause. USS Louisville SSN-724, USN The report makes the conclusion that the objects likely never went below the water’s surface due to the submarine’s lack of awareness that the event was even occurring. If it did submerge, it meant this object represented a “highly advanced capability” that could evade the submarine’s ultra-sensitive sonar and hydrophones. And that’s not the only conclusion the report comes to, there are six in all: The ‘Anomalous Aerial Vehicle’ was of unknown origin and represented technology not currently in the possession of the U.S. or any other nation. It featured broadband RF stealth making the use of radar against it largely ineffective. The craft manifested extreme performance but did not have lifting structures or control surfaces required for traditional flight. It showed that it has some kind of advanced propulsion capability making it able to go instantly from hovering to very high speed and to make very abrupt course changes. It was able to ‘cloak’ itself, becoming invisible visually to the naked eye. Possibly capable of operating undersea without being detected by the most advanced sub-surface sensors. Tic Tac Report Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer that ran the AATIP program in association with contractor Bigelow Aerospace , told the I-Team that this is one of many other documented encounters that are just as impressive, but because of their classification, he can’t share details about those incidents. It’s also worth mentioning that a somewhat similar, albeit less compelling incident has been disclosed. It occurred in the Atlantic 11 years later, with Hornet pilots once again being the on-scene investigators. You can read about this incident here and see the video that was published along with it below: https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Fd6ssvcBoM What’s more compelling is that this report is a far less in-depth and detailed white paper than its highly classified companion, which we aren’t likely ever to be able to see. Regardless if you think the AATIP program was totally legit or some type of elaborate misinformation mechanism dreamed up in the darkest corners of the defense-industrial complex, during that week in November of 2004, something totally strange did indeed occur. And it didn’t just happen in a blink of an eye, it happened over days, with the object in question being examined by a multitude of the U.S. Navy’s front-line sensors as well as by the human eye of one of the best-trained and reliable observers one can imagine.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Israel Says Its F-35Is Have Flown Strikes As The Drumbeat For War With Iran Gets Louder,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel says that its first F-35 squadron is already conducting operations, including at least two combat missions, in an unusual public acknowledgment about sensitive military activities. The disclosure shows that the Israeli Air Force continues to be at the forefront of aerial warfare developments , may help explain a number of odd recent reports about incidents near or over Syria , and is likely a message aimed in large part at Iran and its regional proxies . Israeli Air Force (IAF) commander Major General Amikam Norkin made the announcement among other updates about his service at the opening of the country’s International Air Force Commander Convention, which is hosting air force personnel from around the world, on May 22, 2018. The IAF chief used a picture of F-35s, which Israel calls the Adir, or “mighty,” flying over the Lebanese capital Beirut as a backdrop. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) refused to release a copy of that image to the press, according to The Times of Israel . “We performed the F-35’s first ever operational strike. The IAF is a pioneer and a world leader in operating air power,” Norkin declared. “You know that we just won the Eurovision with the song ‘Toy.’ Well, the F-35 is not a toy,” the general officer added, referring to Israeli singer Netta Barzilai’s winning entry in the latest iteration of the annual musical competition. Norkin did not say when or where the two combat missions had occurred, what types of munitions the aircraft had employed, or what the specific objectives of those sorties might have been. He did, however, make clear that the stealthy jets did not take part in a massive Israeli retaliatory strike against Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria on May 10, 2018. An Israeli F-35I Adir refuels from a US Air Force tanker during its flight to Israel in 2016., USAF Israel declared initial operational capability with the F-35I in December 2017 . At that time, 140 Squadron, the country’s sole unit flying the aircraft had nine Joint Strike Fighters. Another six were scheduled to arrive at an unspecified time in 2018. With the exception of the first two aircraft, all of Israel’s jets reportedly have versions of the Block 3F software package , which would give the aircraft the ability to employ both GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Paveway-series laser-guided bombs from its internal weapons bays while maintaining its full stealth characteristics. The U.S. Air Force has also cleared the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb on its F-35As, which are similar to the F-35I. In addition, the Israelis have also secured the unique rights from the manufacturer Lockheed Martin to modify and add additional code into the aircraft’s mission computer , which may have allowed them to integrate other weapons on the aircraft. The F-35s could also have help direct stand-off strikes by non-stealthy aircraft. With its low-observable features, the F-35 would be better suited to penetrating through dense, integrated air defense networks, such as those in Syria, to get close enough to its targets to engage with precision-guided bombs. Whatever the case, the F-35Is conducting strikes is a major milestone for the IAF, as well as the international Joint Strike Fighter program, which has and continues to suffer delays, development difficulties , manufacturing issues , and more . For Israel specifically, being the first of the nearly 12 current or future F-35 operators to use the jet in combat reinforces its position as a major aerial power, as Norkin noted. The announcement is well in line with the country’s other previous air combat milestones. Notably, in 1979, Israel was the first country to achieve an air-to-air kill with an American-made F-15 Eagle fighter jet and the IAF subsequently became the first to truly realize that aircraft’s potential as a long-range strike platform, which you can read about in more detail here . The Israelis have also been leaders in expanding the capabilities of the F-16 Viper platform , having been the first to use that aircraft in combat in 1981, as well. The country has been at the forefront of development of advanced air-launched stand-off munitions , too. An Israeli Air Force F-15I Ra’am multi-role combat jet., IAF As such, that the Israelis are employing their F-35s in combat is not particularly surprising and may be part of the reason for an increasing number of curious rumors and other reports about the country’s aerial activities over Syria. It seems relatively clear that reported Adir operations in October 2017 and March 2018 were spurious. In March 2018, FlightGlobal did report , citing unnamed sources, that the F-35Is had gone into combat the month before, but said at that time that Major General Norkin had classified all information about the type’s activities. If true, this may mean the Adirs were involved in the response to an Iranian drone that penetrated Israeli airspace from Syria and was reportedly on armed and on its way to carry out a strike of its own. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holds a piece of an Iranian drone, which Israel says was on its way to carry out a strike, during a press conference in February 2018., AP That incident led to a flurry of activity in which Syrian air defenders managed to shoot down an F-16I Sufa multi-role fighter jet and damage an F-15. Israel has routinely targeted Syria’s surface-to-air missile systems that engage its aircraft over the country and may have decided under the circumstances to commit the low-observable Adirs given the apparent danger to its non-stealthy combat jets. It may have also been a turning point in deciding to employ the aircraft on a more regular basis given the apparent change in the severity of the threat to non-stealthy aircraft. Then, on the night of April 16-17, 2018, Syria initially claimed there had been another Israeli strike, before saying that the incident had actually been a false alarm. Russian sources subsequently accused the United States and Israel of launching an unspecified electronic warfare or cyberattack to confuse Syrian air defenders. An Israeli F-16I Sufa multi-role fighter jet., IAF Though it would seem odd for such an operation to not include a kinetic strike, it could have been an intelligence or reconnaissance mission or some other sortie to probe the country’s defense networks. This may have been an instance of the F-35Is using their powerful array of electronic warfare surveillance systems to scoop up data on enemy radars and other air defense nodes. A rumor also emerged that Israeli F-15s had used American callsigns and transponder codes to mask their approach and sneak in and out of Syria largely undetected during another major series of strikes on April 29, 2018. Though the IAF’s F-15s were reportedly part of that mission, the F-35Is could have helped clear, or at least prove, a safe route in and out of the country and may have been better suited to engaging the targets that were further away from the Lebanese border. Israel regularly conducts missions into Syria via Lebanon, but typically against targets nearby, such as those in and around the Syrian capital Damascus. The April 29, 2018 operation included strikes near Aleppo, further to the north, with additional reports that the Israeli aircraft employed Small Diameter Bombs in that instance. We have no way to confirm whether local witnesses actually found the GBU-39/B in the Aleppo area or if they were from this particular strike. It is equally possible that the IAF would have been unwilling to send the highly sensitive F-35Is deep into Syria in the initial combat sorties and instead used them to launch SDBs from Lebanese airspace – which would help explain the picture of the aircraft over Beirut – against targets closer to the border. Other aircraft, such as F-15s or F-16s, could have launched stand-off strikes into more high-risk areas as they have done in the past. Regardless, Israeli airstrikes into Syria have become increasingly pronounced in the last 18 months as the country has stepped up its campaign against Iranian interests in that country. There are only likely to continue to be more opportunities in the near future where the F-35Is can play some sort of direct or supporting role. And Norkin’s apparent decision to declassify the F-35I’s combat debut seems in no small part to be a signal to the Iranian regime about Israel’s continued willingness and capability to use its most advanced capabilities to defend its own interests. The IAF chief’s statements are just the latest in a number of uncharacteristic disclosures that all appear in line with this over-arching message. One of the first F-35Is for Israel in 2016., Lockheed Martin In March 2018, Israel officially admitted that it had launched an air strike to destroy Syria’s nascent nuclear weapons program more than a decade earlier. Though there were a number of domestic political reasons for this release, as well, the IDF was still keen to use it as an opportunity to reinforce the credibility of its threats of military action. “The message of the attack on the reactor in 2007 is that Israel will not accept the construction of a capability that threatens the existence of the State of Israel,” IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot said in a statement at the time. “That was the message in ’81 [with the strike in Iraq]. That was the message in 2007. And that is the message to our enemies for the future.” Ahead of the May 10, 2018 operation over Syria, Israel also publicly accused Iran of being directly responsible for a series of rocket attacks into Israeli-occupied areas of the Golan Heights, another rare statement. The IDF subsequently released a significant amount of information and imagery relating to those strikes on Iranian targets, another uncommon decision for a country that has typically refused to confirm or deny such operations occurred at all. Major General Norkin’s reveal of the F-35I’s combat activities also comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a grandiose presentation of stolen data regarding Iran’s nuclear aspirations. Though the information was dated and did not indicate Iranian officials were still pursuing a nuclear weapon, the press conference seemed to never the less make the case for military action to prevent the regime in Tehran from doing so in the future. This, of course, came right before U.S. President Donald Trump announced his administration was pulling out of the controversial multi-national deal with Iran over its nuclear activities. On May 21, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo further outlined a dozen demands the U.S. government has for its Iranian counterparts, which would be virtually impossible for them to fulfill except under extreme duress. Again, the underlying argument there seemed to be that military action was increasingly the only choice for constraining Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East and beyond. In addition, Norkin’s use of Beirut, home base of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, may have been an implicit threat against that group, and Iranian proxies in general. However, Lebanon’s air defenses are completely unable to challenge the regular intrusions by non-stealth Israeli jets and there’s no indication that the IAF would actually need the Adirs for any future operations in that country. And if nothing else, the announcement also coincides with the 70th anniversary of both the founding of Israel and the creation of the IAF, both of which occurred in 1948. Revealing the Adir’s combat activities, no matter how limited, is clearly a major point of national pride. Still, the idea that the F-35I flying missions over could serve as a significant tacit threat toward Iran and its regional state and non-state partners is something we at The War Zone have discussed before in the past. It also carries a number of potential risks, though. As I wrote after IAF declared IOC with the Adirs: “The F-35Is would offer increased protection for Israeli pilots flying these missions, even over Syria’s most densely defended areas, such as around the capital Damascus. And if nothing else, sending the Adirs into Syria would provide a real world demonstration of their capabilities for both the Syrians and the Iranians, as well as Iran’s other regional proxies, to see. With this in mind, we could see the jets used on an operational mission as early as tonight. … “And even though the F-35Is would be even better protected against Syrian air defenses, there is always the possibility of a lucky shot or just an accident. The Joint Strike Fighter’s low observable characteristics don’t actually render it invisible and the jets aren’t immune to normal wear and tear . During 140 Squadron’s qualification period, one of its Adirs ended up briefly grounded after a bird strike . “The practical and political fallout from an F-35 crash over Syria would be immense, not just to Israel, but to other Joint Strike Fighter operators, including the United States. There is nothing to suggest the  Syrians wouldn’t happily share any parts of the aircraft they might recover with Iran, as well as Russia. Even if those countries were  unable to glean any significant information from their examinations, it  would be a propaganda coup for all of them.” There is also the potential that Russia, which has so far declined to engage any Israeli aircraft flying strikes in Syria and appears to be strengthening its own ties with Israel , maybe be able to glean important details about how its existing air defense systems, including the S-400 surface-to-air missile system , might perform against the jets. The United States and other NATO country have already voiced concerns about leaks of sensitive information about the aircraft from fellow alliance member Turkey , which is in the process of receiving both F-35s and S-400s . We don’t know whether Israel’s combat use of the F-35 has the U.S. government’s blessing, but Israeli authorities clearly believe that the benefits of employing the stealthy jets outweigh the risks. And now that we know the Adirs are flying actual missions, it may become more obvious when and where the aircraft are flying.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 10, 2018",Pompeo’s 12 Demands For Iran Read More Like A Declaration Of War Than A Path To Peace,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the United States will end still-unseen crippling sanctions against Iran if the regime in Tehran effectively capitulates to the U.S. government and agrees to a dozen demands. America’s top diplomat offered little detail on any overarching strategy the U.S. government has to extract these concessions, but strongly implied that Iranian authorities needed to comply or risk some sort of American-backed push for regime change. Pompeo announced the 12 points in a speech at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C. on May 21, 2018. This came nearly two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump had announced his administration would no longer abide by the multi-national Iran Deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA . Under that deal, Iran had gotten relief from existing sanctions in exchange for certain limits on its nuclear activities. According to the Department of Treasury, the United States will begin reimposing those economic and other restrictions in two tranches, one within 90 days and another no later 180 days after Trump’s announcement. Pompeo’s comments seemed to suggest there would be additional sanctions on top of the ones that had been in place prior to the JCPOA coming into effect in 2015, but he offered few specifics on what they might entail. “These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are complete,” Pompeo said. “After our sanctions come into full force, [Iran] will be battling to keep its economy alive.” The Secretary of State said the United States would halt these plans if Iran met its demands, which are as follows: “First, Iran must declare to the IAEA a full account of the prior  military dimensions of its nuclear program, and permanently and  verifiably abandon such work in perpetuity.” “Second, Iran must stop uranium enrichment and never pursue plutonium reprocessing. This includes closing its heavy water reactor .” “Third, Iran must also provide the IAEA with unqualified access to all sites throughout the entire country.” “Iran must end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and halt further launching or development of nuclear-capable missile systems.” “Iran must release all U.S. citizens, as well as citizens of our partners and allies, each of them detained on spurious charges.” “Iran must end support to Middle East terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hizballah [ Hezbollah ], Hamas , and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad .” “Iran must respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi Government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration of Shia militias .” “Iran must also end its military support for the Houthi militia and work towards a peaceful political settlement in Yemen.” “Iran must withdraw all forces under Iranian command throughout the entirety of Syria.” “Iran, too, must end support for the Taliban and other terrorists in  Afghanistan and the region, and cease harboring senior Al Qaida leaders.” “Iran, too, must end the IRG [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] Qods Force’s [Quds Force’s] support for terrorists and militant partners around the world.” “And too, Iran must end its threatening behavior against its neighbors – many of whom are U.S. allies. This certainly includes its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also includes threats to international shipping and destructive – and destructive cyberattacks .” None of these demands are new or necessarily unreasonable individually or when one considers them in a vacuum. It goes without saying that since it agreed to the JCPOA, Iran has developed increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles that implicitly threaten its neighbors, exported either some of that technology and expertise to state and non-state actors who have gone on to strike American partners in the region, continued to bankroll terrorists and other militant groups in countries such as Syria and Yemen , committed gross human rights violations against its own people, and called for the total destruction of Israel . But while these demands are definitely in the United States’ own interests, if Iran were to comply with these points, it would effectively be ceding all of its interests to the U.S. government. The regime in Tehran could quite rightly question how the United States can demand it respect the sovereignty of other nations when Pompeo’s speech calls for total Iranian submission American policies. A number of Pompeo’s specific stipulations are particularly notable in this regard, with some even calling for steps that would limit Iran’s domestic civil development in addition to its ability to exert influence in the Middle East and beyond. Many of them also place the onus entirely on Iran for complex geopolitical realities. The first and second demands essentially call for Iran to abandon any domestic nuclear ambitions whatsoever. Under these parameters, if Iran were to pursue civil nuclear power in the future, it would have to source the fuel for those reactors from external sources, rather than producing it itself. Under the JCPOA, Iran continued to produce low-enriched uranium to support a peaceful nuclear energy program, which it has the right to as a signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty . Iran’s IR-40 heavy water reactor at Arak in 2012., Nanking2012 via Wikimedia Pompeo’s third stipulation also continues to places the blame on Iran for limiting access to potentially nuclear-related sites, even though it was the IAEA that had refused to inspect the Iranian military base at Parchin for possible violations of the Iran Deal. The U.N. nuclear watchdog consistently said the U.S. government had failed to provide the necessary evidence to support its request that inspectors go to that location. For Iran, the fifth demand might seem odd given the Trump administration’s conciliatory tone toward North Korea over the release of three Americans earlier in May 2018. “We want to thank [North Korean premier] Kim Jong Un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people,” Trump himself, who is eager to meet with Kim to try and extract concessions over its nuclear and missiles programs , said during a press conference at Andrews Air Force Base along the former prisoners. The seventh and ninth points effectively call on the governments of Iraq and Syria to break ties with Iran. It goes without saying that the United States has little if any leverage to compel Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad to eject his Iranian allies and their proxies, who have been essential to the stability of his regime, from his own country. At the same time, on May 21, 2018, Syria’s government declared it had just reestablished complete control over the capital Damascus and its suburbs for the first time in years, yet another example that Assad is firmly in power for the time being. In Iraq, a political bloc led by the firebrand Shia cleric Muqtada Al Sadr, a long time adversary of the United States and friend of Iran, won the country’s recent parliamentary elections. The U.S. government lauded those polls as evidence of Iraq’s progress. It’s worth noting that Sadr traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2017 to meet with that country’s rising start, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, but there was no indication that he was willing to break his own personal connections with Iran or those of Iraq’s existing government . An Iraqi youth holds a picture of Shia cleric and politician Muqtada Al Sadr after his movement dominated Iraq’s parliamentary elections earlier in May 2018., Ameer Al Mohammedaw/Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP When it comes to the remaining points, its impossible to say that Iran might not change course under the right conditions. It also seems clear that the ruling regime in Tehran views many of these activities, including supporting regional proxies and the development of long-range weapons, as key to its survival against the threats it perceives – real or imagined – from the United States , Israel , Saudi Arabia , and other potential opponents. Most importantly, Pompeo made no indication that the United States had been working with allies and partners on a unified effort to enforce sanctions and goad Iran into changing policies. Beyond that, he only outlined vague plans to “work closely with the Department of Defense and our regional allies to deter Iranian aggression” and “advocate tirelessly for the Iranian people.” That latter point, which he underscored by mentioning Iran’s crackdown on women who had defied the regime’s morality code and protested rules regarding the wear of hijab , is somewhat undermined by similar actions in Saudi Arabia. Despite glowing reports of reforms under the growing influence Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the government in Riyadh arrested a number of prominent activists on the eve of Ramadan, accusing them of treason and seeking to undermine the country’s monarchy. Even more worrisome, from Pompeo’s remarks, it appeared that the U.S. government had not only abandoned plans to try and work on a new strategy to tackle Iran with the other parties to the Iran Deal – including American allies the United Kingdom, France, and Germany – but had also made no serious attempt to garner international support for its still largely undefined sanctions packages before announcing them. The Trump Administration has stressed its intent to sanction any country, allied or otherwise, that continues to engage with Iran. Representatives from the European Union, Iran, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom meet to discuss the future of the Iran Deal without the United States on May 18, 2018., T Monasse/ANDBZ/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP “You should know that we will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account,” Pompeo said. “Over the coming weeks, we will send teams of specialists to countries around the world to further explain the Administration’s policy, discuss the implications of sanctions re-imposition, and hear your concerns.” Despite Pompeo’s bluster, the United States has already essentially acknowledged that there’s now too much US-Iranian engagement to reimpose sanctions overnight. Parties have three to six months at least to investigate alternative methods of continuing their business activities, either within the United States or by moving their operations to another country. So far, major U.S.-based companies, which are increasingly eager to placate Trump to ward off a late-night flurry of Tweets that could send their stock price crashing, have been the ones to most publicly begin cutting ties . In an era of multi-national commerce and trade, sanctions only have a chance at working if there is broad support from other parties to take similar action. Many of America’s major allies disagree with its actions and have already announced plans to try and assure Iran’s economy will continue to operate at its present level in hopes of saving the Iran Deal. And in an attempt to ease fears among allies over the possibility of additional sanctions, the Trump administration has already exempted nearly a dozen states from those threats of economic restrictions in exchange for plans to steadily reduce interactions with Iran, especially the import of oil. Russia and China have made it clear they intend to continue business as usual with the country. China may even increase its trade , further helping to offset the impact of sanctions. For its part, Iran has already taken another opportunity to drive a wedge further between the United States and its traditional allies over the issue. After Pompeo’s remarks, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif Tweeted out that the threats, which he said were “dictated by a corrupt Special Interest,” a likely reference to Israel, would not stop his country from working on a “post-U.S. JCPOA” type deal. US diplomacy sham is merely a regression to old habits: imprisoned by delusions & failed policies—dictated by corrupt Special Interest—it repeats the same wrong choices and will thus reap the same ill rewards. Iran, meanwhile, is working with partners for post-US JCPOA solutions. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) May 21, 2018 In addition, in pulling out of the Iran Deal, the United States has now closed itself off to many potential alternative avenues to seek the concessions it wants from Iranian authorities. Notably, in Syria, as the situation stabilizes for Assad, his allies are finding themselves increasingly at odds. On May 17, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has become increasingly close with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, implied that Iran should begin withdrawing its forces and demobilizing its proxies from Syria. Iran has since rejected that demand , saying it will stay as long as the Syrian government asks it to remain. So far, the United States does not appear to be able to take advantage of this rift and drive a wedge between the two countries. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway had already noted just how much the Trump Administration’s attitude of maximalist demands could backfire more broadly earlier in May 2018, writing: Is Iran a bad actor in the  Middle East? Absolutely, no news there. Has the magnitude of their reach increased since 2015? Yes, it has. But that ship has sailed. If the White House wants to deal with Iran’s extra-territorial activities or ballistic missile programs than it can make a case for doing so without ripping up the nuclear deal unilaterally and injecting massive quantities of uncertainty into a region that is already far from stable. Now that the U.S. has acted, if Iran moves to immediately reconstitute their nuclear program, other increasingly powerful players in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are sure to follow with the spinning up of their own nuclear programs. In fact, moving toward a mutually assured destruction model by acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities may be invited at this point as the word of the United States is now deeply in question even when it comes to its very own non-proliferation deals. In other words, for Saudi Arabia, which is also increasingly assertive in the region, just getting its own nukes and not having to depend on the U.S. to contain Iran is likely a welcome prospect at this point. Beyond how this decision impacts the North Korean nuclear weapons issue and the security situation in the Middle East in the longer-term, we now have to wait to see what shorter-term actions will occur as a result. The U.S. government seems to be drawing the wrong lessons from its North Korea model of “maximum pressure” and is trying to apply them, but without any of the same multi-national support, to Iran. Iran, which is far less isolated than the regime in Pyongyang on an international level, has far less reason to acquiesce to the United States’ demands in general. And seeing the U.S. government’s demands for Iran may only cause further pushback from North Korea, which seems to be increasingly angry about the Trump Administration’s public pronouncements about the likelihood of it abandoning its nuclear arsenal and making other concessions. It is clear that Kim and his regime see themselves as negotiating from a position of strength in regards to the planned summit with Trump and are incensed at the possibility of being treated as anything less than equals when they arrive in Singapore in June 2018. Pompeo and North Korean premier Kim Jong Un smile and laugh as they shake hands during a meeting earlier in May 2018., KCNA Taken together, in its apparent divergent approaches to North Korea and Iran, and its lack of international support even from many of its own allies with regards to the latter, the United States risks isolating itself and damaging its credibility as a reliable negotiating partner. By attempting to pursue both sets of policies at once, the U.S. government is stretching its resources thin and also increases the potential for at least the appearance of contradictory double standards. All told, the vague strategy Pompeo outlined, coupled with the laundry list of demands that Iran would almost certainly reject out of hand, seems to be a prelude to an argument for military action rather than a realistic approach to negotiations. The Secretary of State did not use the phrase “regime change” in his speech or during the following question and answer session, but it’s hard to see how his proposal calls for anything else. “We are working certainly diplomatically in the lead, but Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, each of us has the same mission from President Trump,” Pompeo said. “I can’t put a timeline on it. But at the end of the day, the Iranian people will decide the timeline [for meeting these demands].” For American policies, regarding either Iran or North Korea, to be successful, they need to be grounded in a clear, concise, and most importantly realistic strategy that does its best to elicit international support. Unfortunately, what we’ve seen so far is less a diplomatic path forward and more a potentially disastrous set of ultimatums.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 4, 2022",This Is What A Boeing F-32 Would’ve Looked Like If Lockheed Lost The JSF Competition,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In 2001, Boeing’s X-32 stood off against Lockheed’s X-35 in a fly-off for the massively lucrative Joint Strike Fighter contract. Making a stealth fighter capable of carrying a significant payload while also having a version that can take off in short distances and land vertically was quite the task, and both companies went about solving the problem very differently. In the end, the X-32 lost to the X-35 for a number of reasons that we will get into in a future post, but many who were taken aback by the X-32’s ‘unique’ looks didn’t realize that Boeing had already planned a number of very significant design changes for their production F-32. Now, thanks to our friend Adam Burch over at Hangar-b.com we can take another look at what this aircraft would have become. Adam Burch/ hangar-b.com Adam Burch/ hangar-b.com Adam Burch/ hangar-b.com Adam Burch/ hangar-b.com Adam Burch/hangar-b.com Partially as a result of the Navy pushing for performance changes late in the game—too late to integrate those changes on their X-plane demonstrators—Boeing’s design refinements included an entirely new wing concept. Gone was the big modified delta wing and in its place was a more traditional fighter wing configuration that also included separate, fully articulated ‘tailerons.’ The X-32 demonstrator with its massive delta planform. , Boeing/JSF program X-32 production configuration mockup., Boeing The aircraft’s nose was also remolded as well to accommodate a radar and its notorious inlet design would become a bit less ‘gaping’ and included a more refined forward-swept ‘underbite.’ The cockpit canopy also changed, losing the bow and going to an unobstructed bubble configuration. There were many other smaller changes made to the jet’s original mold-line as well. Overall the F-32A was a less exotic and more attractive design that retained a lot of internal volume for fuel and weapons. Its remodeled wing retained much of the wide chord and camber of its delta-wing predecessor. The aircraft’s inlet design was still an issue but with the alterations, less of the engine face would have been visible to radar from front hemisphere aspects and the design always intended to incorporate a variable geometry baffle on the engine face to greatly reduce the aircraft’s critical head-on radar cross-section. Boeing/JSF program Boeing/JSF program Boeing/JSF program Boeing/JSF program So even though it still might have deserved to lose to the X-35, the F-32 concept is largely misunderstood because the X-32 demonstrators really didn’t represent the baseline design configuration. At least aesthetically, the F-32 was miles ahead of its proof of concept progenitors, and that probably would have helped its bid to become the largest military aircraft program ever.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Nov 15, 2018",Photo Of The Pentagon’s Shadowy Special Operations Mothership Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly half a decade ago, U.S. Special Operations Command with the help of U.S. Military Sealift Command began the task of quietly turning a modern roll-on, roll-off cargo ship into a highly customized, mobile special operations mothership and sea base. In 2015, the ship that was once MV Cragside was well into its transformation at the BAE Systems shipyards in Mobile, Alabama. We were the first media outlet to post a picture of the extensive modifications being done to the already futuristic looking ship. You can read all about its highly unique capabilities here and see that photo posted below. Since then, nearly nothing has been heard or seen of the vessel. It has literally vanished, until now. The last image we have of the ship was taken in 2015 while it was receiving its heavy modifications in Mobile., Jbarnes/Wikicommons The question of how a vehicle so big and unique could simply disappear for years on end is what prompted our investigation. Upon reviewing satellite imagery, it was clear that ship left its pier in Mobile sometime between mid 2015 and early 2016. After a period of sea trials, and with its laughably innocuous new name MV Ocean Trader, the vessel reportedly entered the Mediterranean on May 16th 2016 for the very first time. Over the next year and a half, the Ocean Trader’s AIS transponder only popped up very briefly on a few occasions according to vessel tracking websites. It called on Gibraltar, the U.S. Navy’s pier in Souda Bay, Greece, and IJmuiden, the Netherlands, located at the mouth of North Sea Canal. Beyond these few instances, the ship was a ghost, either not activating it transponder or running under a false identification. The Mediterranean is a very relevant operating area for this vessel, especially in close proximity to Libya where U.S. Special Operations Command continues to hunt down high-value terrorist targets while maintaining a very small in-country footprint. Operating in the Baltic Sea also makes sense as it is increasingly becoming one of the world’s strategic hot spots as Russia becomes far more aggressive towards its neighbors and U.S. interests in the region. It’s also the location of many multi-national exercises every year, ones in which special operations are becoming ever more crucial. But what’s most puzzling is how this modified ship that was already unique looking before SOCOM had a shipyard take a torch to it, which now includes large ports for launching small boats, a fairly massive hangar bay and a big block of an extension behind the bridge, was never photographed during its travels. Ship spotters photograph far more mundane traffic all the time. With the ability to stay at sea unreplenished for a 45 days at a time, and considering the U.S. Navy’s far-reaching logistical capabilities, it’s possible that it spent long stretches at sea, only coming into port when it absolutely had to. And clearly, part of the idea behind Ocean Trader is that it won’t stick out too much from afar—a wolf in sheep’s clothing if you will—but the notion that there hasn’t been a single photo published online of it in three years seems very odd. In fact, we still haven’t seen it in its final configuration. But that all quietly changed last January when the Oman Drydock Company posted images of its new arrivals on their promotional Twitter account. One of those ships just happened to be the elusive Ocean Trader. For a ship that has clearly gone to great lengths to keep its very existence secret, let alone having its current location known, this gap in protocol seems odd, but then again, it isn’t that surprising. For a marketing person who works at the yard, the ship looks like nothing important really at all, and it’s doubtful that many are watching Oman Drydock Company’s Twitter feed that closely. Whatever the case may be, there it is. At first glance, the somewhat weathered ship almost looks like it hadn’t received its elaborate alterations, or maybe it was just a ship of the same class but not the real article. But upon closer examination, it becomes clear that this is indeed the elusive SOCOM mothership. You can clearly see the square extension forward of the bridge. These are the large hangars that were added, with the vessel upper cargo deck becoming a flight deck. You can also clearly see the big block-like addition aft of the ship’s superstructure, an essential alteration that allows the vessel to go from a relatively small crew to support nearly 300 special operations and support personnel. Large communications arrays can also be seen. There is even a .50 caliber machine gun mounted high above the stern and another on the starboard side of the superstructure. Oman Drydock Compay’s shipyard is located in Duqm, Oman, a fairly remote locale nestled along the Arabian Sea. So that puts the vessel in the Southwest Asia area of operations, which makes sense as it’s abilities are extremely well suited for a whole variety of missions that are ongoing there, including counter-terror operations— especially those in Yemen and on the Horn of Africa —as well special operations support in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy has its new gargantuan sea base forward deployed to the region as well, but that ship is a far more conventional affair and is more concentrated on counter-mine warfare than special operations at this time. Regardless of its exact mission at this time, we finally get to see the ship in its finished state, at least from one limited angle. As to where it is now five months after it received servicing at the Omani shipyard, we can only guess. But at least we can confirm that it’s out there, somewhere. Maybe we will get to see new angles of the vessel or at least satellite imagery of it in its new configuration sometime in the future, but considering that we still can’t even identify a home port for the ship, finding it again will be more about luck than anything else.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 14, 2018",Crazy Low-Flying Saudi C-130 Buzzes Right Over A Soldier On The Ground In Yemen,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For years now, the Royal Saudi Air Force has been heavily engaged in operations in neighboring Yemen as part of a controversial coalition effort to defeat Iranian-supported Houthi rebels and their partners. Though Riyadh’s combat jets, such as its F-15S Eagles , Eurofighter Typhoons , and Panavia Tornados , have captured most of the media attention, its fleet of C-130H Hercules airlifters have been especially important for supporting operations on the ground – and the crews are apparently equally eager to show off their more extreme skills. On May 18, 2018, a video emerged online, reportedly of operations in Yemen, with a C-130H zipping right over the head of an individual on the ground. That person tries to slap the underside of the fuselage with a cap or another article of clothing while others appear to cheer at the amazing – and potentially dangerous – display of airmanship off camera. We don’t know how much of this was actually planned or not. The exact location isn’t immediately obvious from the video, which shows the plane flying over a largely barren piece of desert. We do know that the Saudis have been using sand airstrips – runways in the loosest of terms – to support their operations on the ground, including one near the city of Marib. These kind of locations are ideal for the C-130 , which has long demonstrated its ability to take off and land in remote locations with extremely limited infrastructure. In Yemen, the Saudis have employed their fleet of more than 30 Hercules to move personnel and equipment around, deliver weapons and other supplies to friendly forces, and bring in humanitarian aid to areas under the control of the coalition. The importance of the Hercules to Saudi operations in Yemen, as well as the country’s ability to respond to other crises and conduct training exercises, throughout the country and elsewhere in the world, is evident from their plans to purchase dozens of new C-130Js . This proposed deal was included in an agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia reached in 2017 regarding up to $110 billion in military equipment. There were also possible deals to support for the country’s F-15 combat jets , new intelligence aircraft , a flotilla of frigates , and a massive air and ballistic missile defense shield , among other items . The proposed C-130J deal was valued at nearly $6 billion and included 20 airlifters, as well as three KC-130J tankers, and associated support services. At present, the Royal Saudi Air Force has two KC-130H tankers in addition to its existing H-model cargo haulers. If all goes according to plan, Saudi Arabia should begin taking delivery of the new Hercules in 2022. We’ll be waiting to see whether their C-130 crews decide to put the new planes through any similarly crazy, low-level maneuvers.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 17, 2018",Rumors Fly As Huge Mystery Blasts Rock Syrian Air Base With Iranian Ties,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but there are already multiple conflicting reports about the scope and cause of a series of massive explosions of Syrian air base in Hama. Coming relatively soon after a major Israeli aerial operation destroyed dozens of different targets in Syria on May 10, 2018, one report suggests the incident could have been another such strike against an advanced Iranian air defense system, but others sources say it was an accident of varying degrees of severity. What is known is that on May 18, 2018, a series of explosions ripped through the Syrian Arab Air Force’s Hama Military Airport, which is reportedly a major base for Iranian forces and their proxies in the country, destroying fuel and ammunition stockpiles. The detonations were so large that bystanders captured video and pictures of some of them as they occurred, including a towering plume of smoke rising over the base, and posted them on social media. As of yet, there are no official statements from the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad about the cause or extent of the damage, including whether or not the blasts destroyed any aircraft. An initial report from Sky News Arabia indicated that there were just two explosions, but that dozens of personnel at the base had died as a result. More importantly, the outlet said that the incident appeared to be a strike to destroy an Iranian Bavar 373 air defense system located somewhere within the facilities. It is true that Israel has made it pointedly clear, both in its rhetoric and its actions , that it is unwilling to accept Iran’s expanding physical military presence and influence in Syria. On May 10, 2018, following a rocket attack on Israeli-controlled territory in the Golan Heights, which the country made the rare decision to blame directly on Iran’s quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, there was an avalanche of counterstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria, as well as Syrian air defense systems. In April 2018, Israel had also launched a strike at Tiyas Air Base in Syria, also known as T4, one in a broader series of strikes against Iranian interests. This one, however, focused in part on destroying one of Iran’s Russian-made Tor-M1 air defense systems, which it had brought into the country. As such, a strike to destroy a Bavar 373 would definitely be in line with Israel’s recent concept of operations over Syria. The system’s presence in the country at all would suggest a major escalation on the part of Iran. Unveiled in 2016 , the air defense weapon is broadly analogous to the Russian S-300 , which the Kremlin suggested it could give to Assad after a separate U.S.-led missile barrage against the regime’s chemical weapons program. So far, Russia has not followed through with those plans, seemingly due to major protests raised by the Israel government. This decision could have led the Syrian dictator to turn to Iran or for Iranian authorities to make the decision to deploy the system on their own in an effort to bolster Assad’s air defenses, and especially those based near Iranian military operating locations in the country. However, the explosions at the air base in Hama occurred in the middle of the day, which would be extremely uncharacteristic of an air or missile strike. Israel has launched all of its past operations into Syria under the cover of darkness. This is a common tactic for such missions broadly, both to help conceal the strike force and catch the enemy unawares, giving them little time to either evacuate from certain sites or reinforce them. The transporter-erector-launchers associated with the Bavar 373 air defense system on parade in Iran., via PressTV In addition, Iranian officials only reported that the Bavar 373 had passed initial testing in January 2018 and it’s not clear how many of the weapons they have in total. Iran also has long-standing and significant demands for long-range air defenses around key sites within its own territory, which likely the major reason for developing the weapon in the first place. It is still possible that Iran, which has already committed some of its more advanced weaponry to the conflict in Syria, could have decided to send the surface-to-air missile systems to bolster its air defenses in the country against future Israeli attacks. In turn, Israel could have decided strike at the Bavar 373s was a time-sensitive mission that they had to conduct regardless of time of day. The missiles may not necessarily have been the only target, or the focus of any Israeli operation at all, either. Israeli has launched strikes in the past to destroy military supplies in Syria bound for Hezbollah , a Lebanese militant group that receives active support from Iran and Syria . It is also possible that explosions were the result of an attack by one or more small unmanned aerial vehicles, sabotage, or some other more discreet method of striking at the base. There are rumors that a drone strike was responsible for setting off blasts at a Ukrainian ammunition storage depot in 2017. In January 2018, Syrian insurgents opposed to Assad’s regime launched their own, unprecedented mass drone attack on two Russian-operated bases in the country. So far, though, Syrian sources have told other outlets, including Russia’s state-run news agency Sputnik and Lebanon’s el-Nashra TV , that the explosions were the result of a “technical malfunction” that caused a fire, which subsequently spread through a large portion of the base. These sources differed on the total number of detonations though, with some saying that there had only been four, despite witness accounts of at least six. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human rights, an independent monitoring organization, also indicated that the explosions were accidental and that there had been five in total. Its sources said that at least 11 individuals had died in the blasts, including both Syrian and foreign personnel, the latter presumably being Iranian or Iranian-backed forces. The contradictory reports and the lack of verifiable information about the incident all underscore an increasingly tense and fluid situation in Syria, especially with regards to the growing conflict between Iran and Israel. These tensions are only likely to become more pronounced with the U.S. government’s decision to pull out of the controversial international agreement concerning Iran’s nuclear program and its increasingly explicit support for Israel’s strikes against Iranian interests. Accidental or not, with rumors already swirling about previous incidents, and Syrian forces and their allies seemingly increasingly on edge after successive Israeli strikes, a series of huge explosions at a major military base in Syria are exactly the sort of thing that could lead to further miscalculations. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Mar 28, 2018",Mystery Guided Munition Executes Incredible Maneuver In Strange Airstrike Footage,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recent airstrike footage from Afghanistan released by the Pentagon shows a peculiar engagement in which a guided munition appears to approach a target from one direction before abruptly flipping back entirely on itself to make its very short final attack run from the completely opposite direction before detonating in a big fireball. In the video, which was pointed out to us by War Zone reader Trevor Austin, the munition in question is nearly featureless, which only adds to its mystery. The video is from near the Afghan city of Farah. A day after the Taliban fought their way into the provincial capital they were pushed out as a result of an onslaught of air strikes and Afghan security forces offensives. While the battle can be deemed a victory of sorts, the fact that it occurred at all is a stark reminder that America’s ‘Infinity War’ in the battle-ravaged country is far from over and the security situation for Afghans continues to deteriorate in many areas. The final sequence in the video in question shows a group of fighters escaping along a road to a small L-shaped rural structure as the eye in the sky—which in this case is a high-definition thermal camera—looks on. Clearly, the decision was made to take out the fighters along with their cover and the air strike ensues, obliterating the hovel and anything or anyone inside. It’s during this final act that we see the munition, which doesn’t have a thermal signature of a powered missile, heading one way before abruptly reversing course in an entirely different direction at low altitude and then exploding. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pEmkaDTj950 Upon close examination of the video, the munition doesn’t appear to have any consistently discernible features. It literally looks like a medicine capsule. Infrared video, even of the high-definition variety, can make it hard to identify small details, especially of an object flying quickly through the frame. There are artifacts and bleeding in each frame that can make it look as if something is there momentarily when it isn’t. The magnification of the camera can also play tricks on the perception of objects speed and angle of flight. But taking these factors into account, the footage still looks like nothing we have seen before, especially in terms of kinematic performance. After talking it over, the only possible explanations we can come up with at this time is that maybe this is a GBU-44 Viper Strike that was dropped out of the back of an AC-130 and ended up guiding on its target very late in its flight. This still doesn’t make that much sense based on what we are seeing, and the Viper Strike’s big ‘X’ shaped wings aren’t apparent in the video. The AGM-175 Griffin missile would more closely match the shape of the weapon we see in the video due to its smaller control fins, but even those don’t appear in the FLIR footage, and I have never heard of a Griffin being able ot pull of such extreme manuevers. https://youtube.com/watch?v=pyjuhz74hsg Then again maybe it’s a GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition , but its center-mounted wing isn’t really visible and we haven’t seen those in action just yet although they are definitely deep in series production. GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition, Dynetics Lower-cost, lower-collateral damage, and vastly more compact air-to-ground weapons are all the rage right these days and there are many in development, some of which can fit on smaller unmanned aircraft. There are also other specialized air-to-ground munitions and unique methods of delivery that remain undisclosed for various purposes. So it’s possible that what we are seeing here is something entirely new. We also don’t know what the platform is filming the attack or launching the weapon, or if they are even one in the same. Our best bet is that it’s an AC-130W or an unmanned aircraft, but we can’t be sure at this time. What do think we are seeing here? Let us know in the comments below.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 11, 2018",We’ve Posted The Pentagon’s Entire Moment-By-Moment Niger Ambush Video Briefing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon recently disclosed the findings from its months-long investigation into an ambush in the West African country of Niger that left four Americans dead and the circumstances that led up that incident. Now, it has decided to release a nearly 23-minute long, unclassified video presentation that combines a digital recreation of the events with both file footage of U.S. military activities in Africa and actual photographs and clips from the mission itself. Based on the video’s actual filename, the U.S. produced the presentation on March 9, 2018, more than two months before it briefed the public on the results of its review of the ambush, which occurred on Oct. 4, 2017, and crafted more than seven different iterations of visual briefing before settling on this one. The Pentagon has made the video available to the press directly on request, but has not put a full copy online itself. The presentation includes a number of details that the Pentagon left out of both the initial briefing on the events that it gave the press later in October 2017. This information was also absent from the original public accounting of the final investigation’s conclusions and recommendations, which it presented earlier in May 2018 . The most notable new disclosure is that the Nigerien quick reaction force that arrived on the scene hours after the fighting had begun initially mistook the surviving American and Nigerien forces for Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) terrorists and fired on them with heavy, vehicle-mounted machine guns for nearly a minute before realizing their mistake. Thankfully, no one appears to have gotten wounded or died as a result of this embarrassing friendly fire incident, which is likely why the Pentagon decided not to mention it. The video also explains that when the combined force believed they were about to be overrun, they destroyed their radio equipment, preventing any possible communication with French pilots flying Mirage 2000 fighter jets , which were the first outside friendly forces to arrive on the scene. Those aircraft did not directly engage the ISGS terrorists for fear of hitting the Americans and Nigeriens on the ground, who they could not easily distinguish from the hostile force. The fast-moving combat aircraft did succeed in chasing off some of the militants by flying at an extremely low level, which we now get to see footage of in this video through the infrared full motion video camera on a U.S. military unmanned aircraft orbiting the ambush area. In addition, we see American personnel on the ground signaling to French helicopters that arrived in the area later and spent approximately 40 minutes trying to determine the location of the remaining friendly forces, which had established a hasty defense in a wooded area next to a swamp. We now know that at the very end of the skirmish with ISGS, the remaining American personnel assumed they would die and wrote and recorded messages to loved ones on personal electronic devices, likely cell phones. Thanks to the visuals, there’s a better sense of how U.S. Army Sergeant LaDavid Johnson became separated from the rest of the force and remained missing for two days after he had died. Nigerien forces near where the found the body of LaDavid Johnson, as seen through an infrared video camera on a manned or unmanned aircraft orbiting overhead., DOD ISGS terrorists also killed Sergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson, Staff Sergeant Bryan Black, and Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, all also members of the U.S. Army, as well as a number of Nigerien personnel. The other five Army Special Forces soldiers on the mission, who the Pentagon has not named, survived, but with various wounds. The video offers a harrowing rundown of how the ambush played out from start to finish, at least according to the Pentagon’s findings, and is worth watching from start to finish. For the first time, we also get to see the contractor-operated helicopters, which The War Zone was first to report had taken part in the response to the ambush, who arrived after the fighting had ended to help collect the dead Americans. File and mission footage appears to show that Erickson, Inc. was responsible for the Bell 214STs in question at the time. U.S. Africa Command had previously identified only Berry Aviation as being in charge of contract airlift, casualty evacuation, and personnel recovery support in Niger and elsewhere in West Africa. Since it does not operate rotary wing aircraft itself, that company likely sub-contracted to Erickson to fulfill this portion of the contract. A grainy capture from the video showing an Erickson, Inc. Bell 214ST with the US civil registration code N746H., DOD The clip identifies the so-called Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE) in neighboring Chad as being primarily responsible for operations in the Lake Chad Basin, as well. The major threat in that region, on the other side of Niger from Tongo Tongo, is the Nigeria-based Boko Haram terrorist group, also known as ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA). This headquarters was responsible for approving all U.S. special operations forces missions in Niger, which only reinforces questions we raised after the recent briefing on the Pentagon’s investigation about the strained command structure in the region and whether American personnel there have adequate resources. You can read the rest of our analysis of the publicly available information from that review here . Still, while it offers important additional details, the video still leaves many questions unanswered about the exact nature of this particular mission and the U.S. military’s activities in North and West Africa as a whole.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 23, 2018",The Air Force’s Elite Weapons School Has Given The F-35 A New Nickname,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s Viper for the F-16, Warthog for the A-10, Moose for the C-17, Rhino for the F-4, and the list goes on. The USAF, along with the other services, have long histories of giving their combat aircraft new names, oftentimes of the animal kingdom variety, after the planes had already received their official monikers. This was near certain to be the case for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter once it was assigned the less than thrilling official name of Lightning II. Now it’s become clear that a new name has caught on for the stealth jet among the top echelons the USAF’s F-35 cadre, and that nickname is ‘Panther.’ The whole Panther nickname investigation started with just a patch—which have proven to be a very rich source of information as of late—from the 6th Weapons Squadron. The insignia was first spotted by our good friend Stephen Trimble of Flightglobal.com . From that point, we decided to investigate the authenticity of the patch and the ‘Panther Tamer’ phrase displayed on it deeper. The patch also features an F-35 and the unit’s historic skull mascot. The yellow checkers match the Weapons School’s iconic silk flying scarves. , USAF patch @FG_STrim The public affairs shop at Nellis AFB worked with us to confirm that the elite unit does indeed call the F-35 the ‘Panther.’ An email from the 99th Air Base Wing Public Affairs reads: Mr. Rogoway, The panther patch that you’re inquiring about is an F-35 Weapons School patch that the students wear. Pilots in F-35 community are referring to the jet as “Panther”. As always, the official name of the jet is still F-35 Lightning II. A 6th WPS lands at Nellis AFB with the iconic Vegas skyline in the background., USAF/Airman 1st Class Andrew Sarver The fact that Panther has caught on as the F-35’s nickname inside the vaunted hallways and hangars of the USAF’s Weapons School, which is also where a huge part of the service’s tactics development brain trust resides, is telling. If there’s anywhere a new nickname for the F-35 would be born and have a real chance to flourish across the fleet and beyond, it would be there. And judging by the reply above, the nickname may already have spread well beyond Nellis AFB. F-35s taxi in a line at Nellis AFB., USAF/Staff Sgt. Peter Thompson The official naming of the F-35 was and remains such a big deal that the F-35’s website retains a page just for it. It reads in part: In the early days of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program there was a great deal of speculation about what the jet would eventually be named. For months, several potential monikers – like the Black Mamba, Cyclone, Piasa and Spitfire II – were batted about the defense community and hotly debated on aviation blogs around the world. But, on July 7, 2006, all the guesswork came to an end. At a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s production facility in Fort Worth, Texas, the U.S. Air Force officially announced that the F-35 would be called the Lightning II. The name pays homage to two venerable fighters of days gone by: the World War II-era Lockheed P-38 and English Electric’s supersonic Lightning, which entered service in the mid-1950s. At the naming ceremony, then U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley underscored the historic nature of the Lightning II’s name, saying, “This aircraft represents the fruits of lessons learned over a hundred years of flight and aerial combat. We’re excited about bringing it into our inventory, and warfighters around the globe are excited about flying it in defense of freedom.” An F-35A taxis out for a night mission over the Nellis Test and Training Range. , USAF/Ronald Bradshaw The name Lighting certainly has a rich heritage, but it seems like an overly safe and downright boring title for what supposedly is a cutting-edge stealth fighter built for the masses. Panther is certainly more intriguing, and it feels like a good fit considering the F-35’s greatest strength is its ability to stalk its prey without being detected until it’s too late. It’s also interesting that the first we are hearing of this nickname is from the 6th WPS, which was stood up to train Weapons Instructors—also referred to as Target Arms—who become masters at employing the F-35 as a weapon system. When and if they graduate from the crushingly tough curriculum, many of these ‘Panther Tamers’ head back to their squadrons to share their expertise with their flying counterparts. So there is already a fairly rapid and far reaching delivery system for this nickname in play. You can read more about what a Weapons Instructor is in this past feature of mine. The 6th WPS’s roots go back over a century. , USAF/Airman 1st Class Andrew D. Sarver The 6th WPS itself was stood up a year ago, but the unit has a very rich heritage dating back over a century. A USAF press release states : In December 1916, the Signal Corps expanded the number of Aero Squadrons from two to seven because of World War I. The 6th Aero Squadron, as it would later be designated, was first organized in December 1916 at the Army Flying School at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California and then sent to Fort Kamehameha, Hawaii to establish a permanent air presence on the islands. The squadron remained in Hawaii throughout U.S. involvement in World War I, and was working to improve the integration of air defenses over the island before it lost all if its 18 aircraft in the surprise Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor Dec. 7, 1941. Out of the ashes, the unit was quickly re-equipped with P-40C Warhawk fighter aircraft, re-named the 6th Night Fighter Squadron, and thrust into some of the most harrowing aerial conflict seen anywhere during World War II. This rich legacy of valor makes the new 6th WPS the ideal home for the Air Force’s newest investment in air dominance; the F-35A Lightning II. “This squadron has a great history and legacy dating all the way back to World War I,” said Lt. Col. Michael Blauser, 6 WPS commander. According to Blauser, the squadron will be carrying those time-honored traditions forward as it strives to make some history of its own with the F-35 weapons instructor course curriculum. The USAFWS currently comprises 18 squadrons and provides the world’s premier postgraduate weapons and tactics employment training. The rigorous USAFWS curriculum, joined together with the F-35A’s state-of-the-art capabilities and the deep-rooted history of the 6th WPS, will produce humble, approachable, and credible weapons officers determined to maintain dominance over future battlefields. “We’re headed into uncharted waters,” said Col. Michael Drowley, USAFWS commandant. “Every day will require steadfast leadership to ensure our fifth-generation capabilities are as lethal and dominating as possible.” The 6th WPS is projected to be the USAF Weapons School’s largest squadron by 2023, with 30 instructors and 24 assigned F-35As. It seems like almost a given that the Panther title will hop its way over to the Navy and Marine Corps as the Grumman F9F Panther ushered in the jet fighter age for those services 70 years ago. F9F-2 Panther of VMF-223 aboard USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. , USN We will keep our ears and eyes open to see where the F-35’s newfound panther moniker pops up next, but it seems like it’s already here to stay, and that’s an exciting thing for the controversial program.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 14, 2018",Photo Of Secretive French Spy Plane Supporting Campaign Against ISIS Slips Out Online,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A rare, official image of a secretive French C-160G Gabriel intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft supporting the ongoing U.S.-led campaign against ISIS has emerged online. The plane’s appearance comes as coalition forces on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border are in the midst of a new offensive to take the steam out of the terrorist group’s recent resurgence . On May 17, 2018, the official Twitter account of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the top command in charge of operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, made a post lauding France’s contributions to the air war against the terrorists. The Tweet included a picture of French Rafale multi-role fighter jets and the C-160G . “Air support from France is a major part of coalition Defeat Daesh efforts through Operation Roundup,” the social media post said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS and the nickname of the new cross-border mission. “CJTF-OIR works by, with and through partner forces to achieve a lasting defeat of the terrorist organization’s remnants in Iraq and Syria.” The task force quickly took down the post. The replacement Tweet featured the same message, but only had the picture of the Rafales. Since September 2014, France, which was among the first to join the multi-national coalition fighting ISIS, has publicly deployed land-based Rafale and Mirage 2000 and carrier-based Rafale and now-retired Super Etendard combat jets, Breguet Atlantic 2 patrol aircraft, and E-3F Sentry Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) planes, to support the operation. Its special operations forces and artillery units have contributed to the mission on the ground, as well. The activities of the C-160G in the region have been far less publicized, if at all. The French Air Force has historically been very tight-lipped about the operations of Gabriels, only two of which exist. Escadron électronique aéroporté 1/54 “Dunkerque,” or Airborne Electronic Squadron 1/54 “Dunkirk,” operates the pair of aircraft from Évreux-Fauville Air Base in northern France. Based on the twin-engine C-160 Transall transport plane, the Gabriel, which first entered service in 1989, is primarily known as a signals intelligence collector. Festooned with various bits and bumps, it is recognizable from its cargo-hauling cousin. One of the most immediately noticeable changes is an array of very-high, ultra-high, and standard high-frequency radio antenna on top of the fuselage. It also features a prominent in-flight refueling probe to enable long-duration missions. Pods on the wingtips contain the main components of the Thompson-CSF Analyseur Superhétérodyne Tactique, or ASTAC. This system can locate, classify, and analyze hostile emitters, such as radars. The system can reportedly monitor up to 20 items of interest at once and send the information to operators back at base for further exploitation. Thompson-CSF also supplied the Epicéa, or Spruce, communications intelligence suite that can spot and monitor enemy transmissions. The C-160G carries this system inside a retractable dome that extends downward from the bottom of the fuselage in flight. Two sponsons on each side the rear of the fuselage each contain a single Omera 51 panoramic camera, giving the aircraft a secondary capability to collect wide-angle visual imagery. The equipment also allows the crew to perform this mission while remaining at high altitude where it is better protected from threats on the ground and in a better position to perform its main signals intelligence mission. A picture of one of the C-160Gs in flight with the Epicéa system deployed., French Air Force Though seeing one of the C-160G in an operational setting might be rare, that at least one of the Gabriels are flying over Iraq or Syria makes good sense. Aerial intelligence gathering has been an essential part of the campaign against ISIS from the very beginning and continues to be a key part of efforts to finally break up the group for good. In a similar vein, the U.S. Air Force has committed its own RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence platforms, as well as EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare planes, to both monitor the terrorists’ activities and jam their ability to communicate with each other. The United States and other coalition members have deployed a host of other dedicated manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft to gather a variety of other intelligence information, as well as employed combat jets carrying podded sensors on tactical reconnaissance missions. From a specific capability standpoint, the C-160G sensors are nowhere near as robust as those on the much larger Rivet Joints and do not have any of jamming capabilities found on the Compass Calls. The Gabriels fill a niche that is more analogous to the U.S. Navy’s EP-3E Aeries II or one of the various de Havilland Canada Dash-8-based platforms the U.S. Army and special operations forces operate. A US Air Force RC-135V/W takes off from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar for a mission against ISIS in 2016., USAF And though the picture of the C-160G that CJTF-OIR posted online was undated, that the aircraft is in theater now wouldn’t be surprising either. In April 2018, the coalition kicked off Operation Roundup, which notably included a boost in French forces into the region. The month before, French President Emmanuel Macron had also vowed to continue supporting the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in their continued efforts against ISIS. Earlier in April 2018, France had also joined the United States and the United Kingdom in series of missile strikes against sites linked to Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons program. “You’ll see increased operations on the Iraqi side of the border, and the French just reinforced us in Syria with special forces here in the last two weeks,” U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis told American legislators during a hearing on April 26, 2018. “This is an ongoing fight right now.” SDF personnel in machinegun-armed pickup trucks stage on the Syrian side of the border during Operation Roundup., US Army Aircraft such as the Gabriels will be critical in supporting Operation Roundup. Though ISIS’ immediate dreams of a physical Islamic caliphate spanning across the region are over, the organization continues to present a significant threat. At the same time, now that it is no longer focused on holding territory, its members have returned to their terrorist roots and have dispersed in remote areas, from which they have continued to launch sporadic attacks. Persistent surveillance across these wide regions will be essential to pinning down the militants and limiting their ability to operate freely. A map showing ISIS-linked terrorist attacks in Iraq between January and March 2018., DOD It also is another indication that the United States and its allies will likely have to remain in the region for the foreseeable future, despite reports that U.S. President Donald Trump, in particular, is eager to extricate his country from the broadening conflict. Aircraft such as the C-160G provide critical aerial surveillance capabilities and added capacity that local partners – even state military forces, such as those in Iraq – lack. It’s true that Iraqi F-16s have now conducted multiple air strikes in Syria as part of Operation Roundup. They were also able to capture five senior ISIS members , including Ismail Alwaan Ithawi, a senior aide to the group’s leader Abu Bakr Baghdadi. In these cases, however, the United States and other coalition forces directly enabled the missions with critical intelligence information. For France, the Gabriels also offer a way to gather better information about the Assad regime in Syria and its Russian allies. Macron has also taken a strong stance against the Assad more broadly and criticized Russia’s support for the dictator’s regime, though French authorities have downplayed concerns about a serious confrontation with the Kremlin’s forces in the region. Regardless, the continued campaign against ISIS could be one of the C-160G’s last major operations. They have previously conducted missions over the Balkans, Kosovo specifically, and Libya, as well as taking part in earlier U.S.-led operations in Iraq. In February 2018, French Minister for the Armed Forces Florence Parly announced plans to finally replace the aging aircraft with the Falcon Epicure , a design based on the Dassault Falcon series of business jets. The new planes will offer better range and performance than the C-160Gs, as well as be more cost-efficient to operate and easier to maintain. The underlying Transall aircraft dates back to the 1960s and the French Air Force has begun to replace at least some of the transport versions with more modern Lockheed Martin C-130Js , as well. An artist’s impression of the future Falcon Epicture intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft for the French Air Force., Dassault Aviation Adopting a new intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform will give the French an opportunity to get aircraft with more modern sensor suites. The Thales Epicure signals intelligence suite will reportedly be able to combine the basic functions of the two separate systems onboard the Gabriels, reducing the overall space necessary for the equipment on the aircraft. This might then free up room for additional imaging equipment, such as synthetic aperture radars, or multi-camera wide-area persistent surveillance systems, both of which could improve the overall capabilities of the aircraft. France expects the three Falcon Epicures to enter service in 2025. Depending on how the campaign against ISIS has fared, and whether the conflict has expanded into more of a regional confrontation, it’s possible that we might eventually see one of these new aircraft flying over the region in order to continue providing important intelligence in the decade to come.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 24, 2019",Taiwan Wants To Speed Up Construction Of Its New Missile-Toting Stealthy Catamarans,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Taiwan says it is accelerating production of nearly a dozen stealthy Tuo Chiang -class missile corvettes, the first of which will be focused on air-defense missions. The announcement is another part of the island’s attempts to keep pace with China’s People’s Liberation Army’s development of increasingly advanced capabilities in the air and at sea and provide a credible defense during a crisis in the region. On May 14, 2018, Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Yen De-fa said that under the new plan , eight additional Tuo Chiangs – a name that translates simply as Tou River, an upper tributary of the Yangtze on the mainland – would be in service by 2025, with the first three being in an anti-aircraft configuration. The other five will be primarily configured for anti-ship warfare. We do not know what configuration the final three vessels in the class will be in when they enter service, which is still expected to occur in 2039 as laid out in the original schedule. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said that timeline might get moved up, as well. At present, the Taiwanese Navy has one effectively prototype Tou Chiang in service, which it took delivery of from Lung Teh Shipyard in 2014. The ships have been in development since 2011 and the full production examples were initially supposed to arrive in three batches , rather than two. “The corvette is a crucial piece of the military’s asymmetric warfare,” Yen reportedly told the legislature’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in announcing the change in production plan, according to The Taipei Times . “Shortening its construction schedule would increase the nation’s combat capability.” When Yen says “asymmetric,” what he most likely means is Taiwan hopes these ships will offer an important, but cost-effective boost in capabilities against the much larger Chinese military, despite their relatively small size. The primary goal of the class is to be able to help reduce the operational demands on larger, more capable ships during an actual conflict, as well as help protect those surface action groups. The first-in-class Tou Chiang displaces less than 600 tons, but has a top speed of nearly 75 miles per hour. The catamaran-style ship also features a low-observable hullform. Together, this makes the ship larger, faster, and more survivable than Taiwan’s existing Ching Chiang- and Kuang Hua VI- class missile boats. The production ships are expected to have a displacement closer to 700 tons and an elongated hull. This is supposed to help accommodate their primary armament of a vertical launch system array with four cells. The plan would be to use quad-packed missiles to further expand the total number of weapons each one of the corvettes can carry at a time. In the air defense configuration, the cells could contain 16 Tien Chien IIN , also known as the Sky Sword IIN, medium-range surface-to-air missiles. Taiwan first tested this missile, a navalized version of the existing Tien Chien/Sky Sword II air-to-air type, in 2014. A Tien Chien II air-to-air missile. The sea-launched Tien Chien IIN is derived from this weapon., RudolphChen via Wikimedia There have been reports that air defense-focused Tou Chiangs might eventually carry the Tien Kung III , or Sky Bow III, a longer-range surface-to-air missile that has a limited anti-ballistic missile capability. However, the corvettes do not have anything approaching the radar capabilities that would be necessary to track those incoming weapons and cue its missiles to intercept them. To make use of these weapons, the ships would have to rely entirely on networked sensors or other platforms for this mission. The primary armament of the anti-ship types would be 16 Hsiung Feng II or III – translated as Brave Wind II and III – anti-ship missiles. Reports suggest that those vessels could carry a mix of the subsonic Hsiung Feng II and supersonic Hsiung Feng III to offer a cost-effective set of options to engage various types of naval targets. A Hsiung Feng III supersonic anti-ship cruise missile., 玄史生 via Wikimedia All of the Tou Chiangs also have a 76mm rapid-fire gun in a turret on the bow and a Phalanx close-in weapon system toward the stern, as well as launchers for infrared decoys and chaff canisters. The Taiwanese Navy also wants to eventually replace the Phalanx with the domestically designed and still-in-development Sea Oryx , which is similar visually and in concept to the U.S. Navy’s RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile close-in defense system. There first Tou Chiang has a variable depth sonar and two three-tube torpedo launchers that sit behind retractable external doors, giving the ship a secondary anti-submarine capability. It is unclear whether or not these systems will be a part of the final configuration, but it would make sense given China’s large existing submarine fleet and efforts to further improve its undersea capabilities . With their high speed and low-observable characteristics, the Tou Chiangs could offer important additional capabilities for Taiwan in any confrontation with China. Unlike fixed, land-based anti-air and anti-ship defenses, the ships would be able to better conceal themselves from Chinese forces, which is an especially important consideration given how small the island is and how close it is to the mainland. It is possible that the two configurations might be able to work together, with the air-defense versions guarding the other ships carrying anti-ship missiles. Even with only a small number Tou Chiangs , this could allow for rapid, distributed attacks on Chinese surface forces from multiple directions, which could disrupt their plans and force them to divert resources to engage the smaller missile corvettes. Local media in Taiwan has already dubbed the ships “ carrier killers ,” implying that they might offer an answer to China’s growing fleet of flattops . In April 2018, the People’s Liberation Army Navy staged their largest ever exercise in the Taiwan Strait, which included the aircraft carrier Liaoning and dozens of other surface ships and submarines . In October 2017, Chinese premier Xi Jinping had said he would not hesitate use any means necessary to “defeat” any Taiwanese attempt to declare independence. People’s Liberation Army Navy ships, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning , sail in the Taiwan Strait in April 2018., Li Gang/Xinhua via AP Still, they would undoubtedly offer an important boost in capability in the constrained environment of the Taiwan Strait, which puts much of the island and its surrounding area within range of ground-based Chinese anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles , as well as its multi-role fighter and bomber aircraft . That’s not mentioning China’s growing naval capabilities, including Russian-made hovercrafts that could ferry troops and other equipment to the island straight from the mainland in less than two hours during amphibious operations. With their high speed, the Tou Chiangs might be better suited to quickly respond to changing situations and new developments, especially air or sea attacks on the Pacific Ocean side of the island. This is increasingly becoming a new vector for potential threats, with the Chinese recently sending fighters and bombers on a training mission that effectively encircled Taiwan earlier in May 2018. Equally important, the Tou Chiangs could offer a vital extension of the air defense net around Tawian’s larger surface combatants, including its Kee Lung -class destroyers , and Kang Ding -class and Cheng Kung -class frigates. The latter two are French-made Lafayette -class ships , which have their own stealthy features, and derivatives of the U.S. Navy’s now-retired Oliver Hazard Perry -class , respectively. Two of Taiwan’s four Kee Lung -class destroyers. , 玄史生 via Wikimedia These ships form the bulk of Taiwan’s naval combat capabilities, but there are less than 20 of them altogether to face a Chinese Navy that will eventually have nearly as many Type 052D destroyers alone. As such, the would almost certainly be major targets for Chinese forces during a conflict and would be in high demand to provide longer-range anti-air and anti-ship defenses around the island. With Tou Chiangs providing additional local defense or conducting their own distributed attacks, these destroyer and frigate crews could be able to focus their attention on higher priority targets or other more demanding tasks. The Taiwan Strait could easily become a particularly target-dense environment during any actual skirmish, which would demand the smaller Taiwanese military to do its best to try and focus its limited resources on the most important missions. The ROCS Wu Chang , one of Taiwan’s Kang Ding -class frigates., 玄史生 via Wikimedia The larger surface ships, with their more robust sensor suites and helicopters, might be able to quickly locate opponents and vector the smaller corvettes in to attack, too. Taiwan’s Navy is also interested in increasing the networking capabilities on all of these ships, which might allow the Tou Chiangs to receive targeting information directly in the future. But accelerating the production schedule might not be enough to necessarily get the Tou Chiangs into service faster and with their full combat capabilities. In 2016, Taiwan’s negotiations with Lockheed Martin to buy the necessary Mk 41 Vertical Launch Systems broke down and the island’s government said it would look into purchasing less capable Mk 48 launchers in the interim. When the U.S. government announced it had approved more than $1 billion in potential arms sales to Taiwan in June 2017 , the press releases did not mention either system. Without the missile systems, the corvettes would have extremely limited utility as air defense platforms in any high-end conflict. The anti-ship versions would still be able to operate, but would also not be able to rapidly shift roles if necessary. There is no indication that Taiwan has the resources, or any interest, in attempting to develop a VLS system on its own, either. If it did decide to go that route, it would almost certainly require significant help from outside defense contractors, which would again require approval from foreign governments who often have to balance support for Taiwan against angering the government in Beijing. The ships are also competing for limited financial resources and could see cost growth associated with speeding up the construction timetable. As of October 2017, Taiwan’s draft defense budget for the 2018 fiscal year was less than $11 billion . The Tou Chiang cost less than $75 million, but it is unclear whether this included the full suite of weapons and other mission systems. The larger production types could be more expensive to begin with, though experience with the design may help drive down the unit price over time. On top of that, there doesn’t appear to be any plans to expand the shipbuilding capacity at Lung Teh to try and keep up with Chinese developments. Even under the new schedule, the shipyard will be building around one of the diminutive ships every year on average. In a seven-year span, China built more than 80 examples of the Type 22 Houbei- class , a stealthy catamaran fast-attack missile craft with a displacement of about a third of that of the Tuo Chiangs . The country is churning out larger, more advanced surface ships at a prodigious rate , as well. The video below shows Chinese Type 22 missile boats. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4wtV_3pI0RA When it comes to the island’s air defense, the Tou Chiangs could find themselves competing for funding with projects to improve land-based air defenses and the desperate need to modernize the Taiwanese Air Force. At present, the big push there is to upgrade the country’s F-16A/B Viper fighter jets, but there have been reports that Taiwanese authorities might try and lease F-15C Eagle fighters or even buy stealthy F-35B Joint Strike Fighters . One way or another, the island’s authorities will have to address the aging fleet of older combat jets, which are increasingly dangerous to operate , if they are to maintain viable air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities in the near term. This may not necessarily be an issue given the potential for increased support from the United States under President Donald Trump, who, since he was president-elect, has appeared very supportive of the island’s independent government . In March 2018, he signed a bill encouraging increased U.S. government engagement with their Taiwanese counterparts . The Trump administration has separately pursued hardline policies targeting Chinese economic and business practices, as well, signaling a potential for the United States to take a less conciliatory stance toward Beijing’s interests. At the same time, though, Trump himself has publicly called for steps to insulate certain businesses in China – including telecommunications firms the U.S. government has decried as national security threats – from those restrictions, calling into question the true nature of these policies. In the meantime, the Taiwanese government looks intent on having Lung Teh speed up production of the Tuo Chiangs , though it remains to be seen what exact configuration they end up in when they first enter service.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The C-5 Galaxy is one gargantuan flying machine . You really don’t know just how cavernous the aircraft is until you have been inside of one. The folks over at Airman Magazine went about doing just that in a creative way. In a spoof of MTV Cribs , we get a guided tour of the C-5 with a bit of humor thrown in. But above all else, the video offers a really good top-to-bottom look at the layout of these huge cargo jets. It’s amazing how the C-5 captures peoples’ minds. To this very day, I get a steady stream of email from readers that just want to ask me if I knew the C-5 had a full airliner-like cabin above the rear cargo hold. People seem to find it to be a crazy feature, especially considering that you would have no idea that it exists by looking at the aircraft from the outside. Yet there it is, and all but the rocket-carrying C-5Cs were built with this feature. The C-5 is extremely complex and expensive to maintain and operate , even after it received a major upgrade, including new engines, in the form of the C-5M. But its capabilities are irreplaceable for the USAF. You can read all about what it is like to fly the C-5 from a pilot’s perspective in this previous special feature of mine . Just one anecdotal personal experience I had with the C-5 that captures its unique heavy lifting abilities—a USAF Special Tactics squadron was loading up on a C-5 to head to Hawaii for some extensive training. I asked the officer that was overseeing the operation if they were happy to get a C-5 for the trip. He said that they were elated, with the difference being that instead of two or even just one C-17s, where they would have to repack up all their gear in pallets and then unpack everything once there, while also having to acquire vehicles to tow their boats and to get around at their destination, the C-5 allows them to just load up their trucks with their trailers full of gear attached. Once at their destination, they simply roll off in their own vehicles and get right to work! Tyler Rogoway/Author With just 48 upgraded C-5s in inventory—roughly half that of just a few years ago before the fleet was drastically downsized and consolidated—the USAF has been looking to add a number of Galaxies back into the inventory. The jet just has special abilities that C-17 doesn’t and they remain in high demand. That paired with an availability rate hovering in the mid 60 percent range makes such a small fleet even more heavily taxed. As for the whole MTV Cribs knock-off, it’s not the first time it’s been done by any means, and the military seems to have a unique knack at building out good content with these types of reality-based TV show spoofs. This one showing off living conditions for Marines deployed on an amphibious assault ship— USS Bonhomme Richard I believe in this case—is pretty good and serves as a reminder of what life is like for Jarheads deployed at sea. https://youtube.com/watch?v=P70TgvtNvQQ But just the fact that the C-5 is big enough to do a credible Cribs spoof is indicative of its crazy size.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 12, 2019",The Marines Have Finally Received Their First Monster CH-53K King Stallion Helicopter,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has taken delivery of its first CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter. After years of setbacks and delays, and amid new concerns about schedule slips, the service is still hoping to eventually buy as many as 200 of the choppers to replace its fleet of aging and increasingly unreliable CH-53E Super Stallions . On May 16, 2018, the initial Marine CH-53K touched down at Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina. Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, built the helicopter, which is now set to begin a so-called “ Supportability Test Plan ” to help determine the logistical requirements to maintain and sustain the aircraft. The Marines expect to reach initial operational capability with the type by the end of 2019. The first operational element will be a CH-53K detachment assigned to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron Three Six Six (HMH-366), which will be large enough to deploy as part of the air combat element of a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships . It will take approximately four years for that unit to fully transition from the older CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to the new King Stallions. The service hopes to have completely divested the Super Stallions by 2030, according to its 2018 Aviation Plan. The delivery is an important milestone for the CH-53K, which has been in development since 2006. At the beginning of the program, the Marine Corps’ goal was to reach initial operational capability, or IOC, by 2015 and have more than 150 King Stallions on hand by 2021. Delays and difficulties in testing pushed the IOC date first to 2018 and then to 2019. This latest revised timetable has been in place since 2014. In April 2018, however, Bloomberg reported that a review of the program’s progress had identified more than 1,000 deficiencies and raised concerns about whether the aircraft’s IOC schedule could slip by as much as eight months. The outlet did not give a date for the report or what time period its data covered. At the time, Naval Air Systems Command, which manages the program on behalf of the Marine Corps, told the outlet that the timeline had not shifted, but that it was conducting a new risk analysis. “Persistent problems with the [CH-53K’s] main gearbox have required the program to delay the planned completion of system-level demonstration tests by four months – now scheduled to be completed in May 2019,” another previous report from the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, said. “Program officials reported that since the latest redesign, the program has successfully tested the main gearbox.” The CH-53K King Stallion., Lockheed Martin In its own annual review of the program’s activities during the 2017 fiscal year, the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation raised main similar concerns, noting that at September 2017 Sikorsky had not yet even finalized the CH-53K design. In addition, at that time, the flight test plan was only 10 percent complete and continued to slip due to technical issues. Beyond that, the Marines do not even plan to submit the aircraft to initial operational test and evaluation until after the IOC date, similar to the controversial decision to put the F-35B into active service without putting it through that process to determine whether or not it is actually ready for combat. “Pressure is increasing to meet a late December 2019 Initial Operational Capability (IOC), but current projections estimate that the planned 6-month IOT&E [Intiaial Operational Test and Evaluaition] will have started 1 month prior to this desired IOC,” the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation’s report for the 2017 fiscal cycle noted. “Schedule compression has the potential to adversely affect training for the IOT&E aircrews and maintainers. After the Berlin Air Show later in April 2018, which was the international debut for the King Stallion, the Marine Corps dismissed the concerns in the Bloomberg report, saying they were out of date, but did not specifically address any other reports. “You saw the CH-53K fly. Did it look like a helicopter that has a thousand problems with it?” U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Hank Vanderborght, the program manager for CH-53-series helicopters, asked reporters rhetorically . A Sikorsky CH-53K, in Marine Corps markings, touches down at the Berlin Air Show in April 2018., Lockheed Martin The Marines are heavily invested in the CH-53K, having determined years ago that it was critical to replace the older E models. The King Stallion has the same physical footprint as the Super Stallion, but is significantly more capable and features a glass cockpit and fly-by-wire technology to further improve performance and reduce pilot workload. The three General Electric T408 turbines provide approximately 50 percent more power to drive an all-new transmission and a rotor assembly with improved, more efficient blades. This allows the CH-53K to reach a maximum speed of around 230 miles per hour and have a maximum, gross takeoff weight of around 85,000 pounds. It can carry external loads up to 27,000 pounds across distances of more than 100 miles. The CH-53K has increased internal volume, as well, to better handle oversized cargo and small vehicles . “It gets the Marine and naval force off our amphibious ships or wherever you are in a manner which cannot be accomplished by any other aircraft in DOD [the Department of Defense],” Lieutenant General Steven Rudder, the U.S. Marine Corps’ Deputy Commandant of Aviation, told members of Congress in March 2018. “We are able to dual lift Humvees, full-up armored Humvees. So that capability allows maneuver on the battlefield.” The King Stallions can also lift the significantly larger Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), which will eventually replace many of the older Humvees . “It’s the most advanced logistics support platform to warfighters,” U.S. Marine Corps Captain Sarah Burns, a service spokesperson, boasted to Marine Corps Times earlier in May 2018. But in addition to the added complexity, and subsequent delays, this capability increase has come at a significant cost . The initial estimated unit cost for the CH-53K was approximately $122 million, the same as a stealthy fifth-generation F-35B Joint Strike Fighter . If the service proceeds with the full purchase order of 200 aircraft, this could drop to around $80 million apiece. This would still be more expensive than the MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor and around the supposed target price point for later blocks of F-35s. Foreign purchase orders might help further reduce production costs. The Marines’ Supportability Test Plan for the initial CH-53K will likely incorporate efforts to identify other ways to save money on operating and sustaining the new helicopters. The CH-53K performs a demonstration flight at the Berlin Air Show. Germany is looking at the King Stallion as one option to replace its own aging CH-53G helicopters., Lockheed Martin And the CH-53K provides capabilities that are and will continue to be essential to the Marines expeditionary operating concepts. On top of that, the need to replace the older and finicky CH-53Es, which have one of the most abysmal availability rates of any aircraft in the U.S. military, has only become more serious in the past decade. In November 2017, Marine officials informed lawmakers that it only had 143 CH-53Es, despite having a requirement for 200 heavy-lift helicopters, and that, on average, only 37 percent of them were flyable at any given time. Difficulties in keeping the aircraft airworthy, and in turn making it hard for pilots to get in adequate flying hours to remain proficient in the various tasks the helicopter performs, have undoubtedly contributed to a string of deadly accidents with the type. Most recently, in April 2018, a Super Stallion crashed at Naval Air Field El Centro in California, killing all four Marines on board. You can read more about the CH-53’s past and future in this previous War Zone feature . But now the Marines are starting to write what will hopefully be a bright new chapter in the H-53’s long story at Marine Corps Air Station New River with the King Stallion.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 1, 2018",Night Stalker MH-47D Chinooks Once Snatched A Libyan Hind Gunship From Chad,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Recently, the U.S. Marine Corps announced its interest in hiring contractors to fly a Russian-made Mi-24 Hind gunship as a mock enemy during training exercises. It wasn’t always this easy to get access to one of the helicopters. Near the end of the Cold War, in an operation that seems made for a major Hollywood movie, a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport plane discreetly flew U.S. Army special operators and a pair of MH-47D Chinooks from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to the African country of Chad in order to steal one of the big attack choppers. On May 21, 1988, the U.S. military had ordered the start of the mission, known as Operation Mount Hope III, with the relatively simple objective of having the elite Army aviators get to northern Chad and extract a Mi-25 Hind D – the export designation for Mi-24. Libyan forces had abandoned the aircraft, and a host of other equipment, as they retreated after suffering a major defeat at the hands of the Chadian military under the leadership of then-President Hissen Habré . The preparations for and execution of the operation were anything but easy, though. It was “one of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment’s earliest successes and the first major operation utilizing the mighty Chinooks,” an officer from the unit subsequently wrote in a brief history of the mission, which The Black Vault , a repository for previously classified government documents, subsequently posted online. The circumstances that led the Hind to be sitting abandoned at the Ouadi Doum Air Base in northern Chad go back decades earlier. After seizing control of Libya in 1969, strongman Muammar Gaddafi sought to spread his influence and revolutionary ideology across north and central Africa. In addition, he was eager to take control of a contested border region known as the Aouzou Strip , which had become part of Chadian territory after that country gained its independence from France in 1960. A map of Chad from an official historical briefing on Operation Mount Hope II showing Ouadi Doum in the northeast and the capital N’Djamena in the southwest., US Army via The Black Vault For nearly a decade starting in 1978, Gaddafi launched interventions into his southern neighbor and otherwise sought to meddle in the country’s affairs, supporting various rebel groups over the years. In December 1986, the last of these groups, an umbrella organization known as the Transitional Government of National Unity, or GUNT , upset with the Libyan dictator attempts to undermine its leadership and failure to provide economic support in regions under its control, turned on him. Habré seized the opportunity to launch an offensive to regain control of the northern portion of his country. His forces predominantly employed pickups and other light wheeled vehicles and the ensuing conflict became known as the Toyota War . With support from the United States, France, and what was then known as Zaire – now called the Democratic Republic of Congo – the Chadians routed the Libyans and had driven them from the country entirely by the end of 1987. The U.S. Intelligence Community, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency , was already heavily invested in the country and became aware of the Mi-25 in Ouadi Doum. The U.S. government was eager to get its hands on one of the Soviet’s then most advanced helicopter designs. The process of acquiring foreign military equipment to analyze its capabilities and weaknesses, known as Foreign Materiel Exploitation, or FME, remains an important mission for the U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community. At the time, getting a Hind was especially important since the gunships were already participating in a number of conflicts where the United States had active interests, including the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War, and Nicaraguan Civil War. Below is an old Cold War-era US Army training video covering the Hind and other Soviet helicopters. Though Habré was not necessarily opposed to the United States taking the Hind out of Ouadi Doum, he had no interest in being seen delivering the aircraft to the Americans himself. It took months of negotiation to get Chadian authorities to finally agree to the Mount Hope III plan, which was likely more complex than it had to be due to the political considerations. According to another story of the operation from War Is Boring , the United States sweetened the deal with a $2 million payment and a shipment of FIM-92 Stinger shoulder-fired, man-portable, surface-to-air missiles. Even as the debate with the government of Chad continued, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment was conducting exercises just to see if the basic idea was feasible. In March 1988, the unit performed a largely written study, possibly known as Operation Mount Hope, which concluded the MH-47D would be able to lift the Hind and still carry the required fuel load, according to a now declassified historical briefing The Black Vault also obtained. The next month, the special operations aviators performed a complete dry run, known as Mount Hope II. They first loaded two Chinooks onto a C-5 at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and flew to a simulated forward operating site at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The crews from the 160th then took a route spanning 490 miles to a mock target site where one of the two Chinooks lifted six collapsible bladders, or blivets, filled with water simulating the weight of the Soviet helicopter. They then returned to the staging base, stopping twice to refuel at temporary Forward Arming and Refueling Points, or FARPs . The early model MH-47Ds the 160th employed on the mission did not have an in-flight refueling capability. US Army soldiers sling a water blivet underneath a Chinook during a training exercise. In 1988, a single MH-47D carried six of these to prove it could carry a Hind., US Army After receiving the formal order to begin the mission in May 1988, an advance party went first to Germany and then on to the Chadian capital N’Djamena to prepare for the arrival of the main force. On June 10, 1988, Mount Hope III began when a C-5 with two MH-47Ds from Company E, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, as well as approximately 75 additional personnel, flew from Fort Campbell to N’Djamena. Censors redacted the names of these individuals and what units they were assigned to in the briefing The Black Vault posted online. Given the secret nature of the operation, it is possible the additional manpower came from other secretive special operations forces units such as the Army’s Delta Force. U.S. Air Force pararescuemen and a flight surgeon were also part of the task force that actually traveled out to Ouadi Doum. A heavily redacted briefing slide showing the personnel onboard the two MH-47D helicopters during Operation Mount Hope III., US Army via The Black Vault The next day, June 11, the Americans flew nearly 500 miles straight from N’Djamena to the air base, with an escort of French forces, including Mirage F.1 fighter jets. The situation there was tense with reports of increased Libyan activity on the other side of the Aouzou Strip. Months before Gaddafi’s forces had sent his own aircraft to try and destroy abandoned planes, helicopters, and other equipment in the area. When they arrived, the Mi-25 was more or less ready to go. Other American and French personnel had been at the site and elsewhere in northern Chad for months, salvaging other aircraft and equipment. They had tucked the Hind away at the base until the U.S. military could figure out how best to get it out of the base. A rare and grainy shot of the MH-47D picking up the Hind at Ouadi Doum, likely shot using the forward looking infrared video camera on the other Chinook., US Army via The Black Vault With the gunship slung below one of the MH-47Ds, the American force then left for the return flight to the Chadian capital. The helicopters stopped at Faya Largeau and Mousorro to refuel at FARPs that a crew of a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport plane had established for the mission. The U.S. personnel conducted the entire mission under some extreme weather conditions. The peak heat the task force encountered that day was reportedly 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Another redacted slide showing the flight path the MH-47Ds took to Ouadi Doum and back., US Army via The Black Vault More worryingly, as the helicopters got close to their final destination, the crews found themselves in the middle of a massive sandstorm. Trying to keep a tight schedule, the two MH-47Ds reportedly flew at speeds less than 50 miles per hour and within visual sight of each other until they emerged on the other side. The sand followed them to N’Djamena, though, and they had to sit in the safety of their Chinooks for more than 20 minutes until the weather cleared and they could begin loading everything back onto two C-5s. In total, the American force spent less than 70 hours in Chad before returning to the United States with their prize. US personnel load the Mi-25 onto a C-5 in N’Djamena., US Army via Arnaud Delalande For the 160th, which the Army had first begun to form in 1981, it was a major achievement that involved complex mission planning and long-distance staging and operational movements. It also proved that the unit could perform heavy-lift operations under unusual and demanding conditions. It is almost certain that the organization put some of the lessons learned into action in 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama, which involved the long-range self-deployment of MH-47s, including over-water flight, into the country using FARPs. In 1991, the 160th was called upon to demonstrate its capabilities in a desert environment again during Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq. The 160th has since become the U.S. military’s premier special operations helicopter unit , taking part in a host of different missions around the world in more than three decades since Mount Hope III – and likely more that we may never hear about . Separately, CH-47 and MH-47 Chinooks from across the U.S. Army have increasingly become a go-to platform for air assault operations, especially for still-ongoing operations in Afghanistan . Unfortunately, we don’t know if any of 160th’s MH-47s have grabbed any more foreign aircraft covertly. Chinooks have certainly shown off their ability to carry helicopters and aircraft since the mission in Chad. A CH-47D from the Nevada Army National Guard prepares to lift a GF-15A maintenance trainer at Nellis Air Force Base in 2009., USAF The central African country, and U.S. military involvement in Africa more broadly, is back in the news , too, but without many of the players from 1988. In 2016, a special African Union court in Senegal convicted Hissen Habre – who had been living there in self-imposed exile since insurgents unseated him in 1990 – of gross human rights violations and other crimes , including mass rape and ordering the murder of more than 40,000 people during his tenure as leader of Chad, and sentenced him to life imprison. Libyan rebels executed Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 after his regime collapsed in the face of a U.S.-led intervention. That country remains mired in violence the better part of a decade later. If the U.S. military needs to go out and snatch a helicopter again, the 160th is probably still up for the job. But if it needs more Hinds, it’d be much easier to just call up private firms in the United States now to get them.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Oct 19, 2018",North Korea Threatens To Scrap Summit With The United States Over Military Exercise (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un and his regime appear to be trying to use a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump as leverage to force the United States and South Korea to cancel a combined military exercise on the Peninsula. Despite reportedly having agreed to not be publicly critical of the drills, North Korean officials have said they could cancel the planned meeting in Singapore if the two countries continue the maneuvers and have already announced they will no longer attend a high-level engagement with their South Korean counterparts. Yonhap News was the first to report the developments , which came on what is already May 16, 2018, on the Peninsula. The 2018 iteration of the annual Max Thunder exercise, which the South Korean outlet said was specifically at issue, began earlier that month and includes a variety of different U.S. and South Korean aircraft types, including F-22 Raptor stealth fighters . The ostensible goal is to give the two countries a chance to train on how they would conduct a major air war, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, together. Max Thunder “is designed to train allied air forces to quickly generate overwhelming air power under realistic conditions,” a U.S. military press release explained after the Max Thunder exercise in 2017. “Max Thunder serves as an invaluable opportunity for U.S. and ROKAF [Republic of Korea Air Force] forces to train together shoulder-to-shoulder and sharpen tactical skills vital to the defense and security of the Korean Peninsula,” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas Bergeson, head of Seventh Air Force, the service’s main unit in South Korea, said at that time. Max Thunder typically occurs concurrently with the larger annual U.S.-South Korea Foal Eagle exercise , which incorporates ground and naval forces, as well. According to the Pentagon, the 2018 iterations of Max Thunder and Foal Eagle were ongoing as of May 15, 2018, after both countries agreed to push them back so as not to conflict with the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang earlier in the year. There were no plans to halt them in response to North Korea’s objections. A South Korean Air Force F-15K Slam Eagle taxies past an FA-50 light combat jet, at far right, and a pair of F-4E Phantom IIs during Max Thunder 17., USMC So far, news of Foal Eagle and Max Thunder appears to be extremely muted, with very few official press items appearing on the websites of U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Forces Korea, or U.S. Pacific Air Forces.  Earlier reports suggested that the United States and South Korea had agreed to scale back the overall scope of the drills, as well. It is very likely that United States has done this deliberately so as not to inflame tensions with North Korea ahead of the summit in Singapore between Trump and Kim, which is set to take place on June 12, 2018 . The lack of official statements stands in stark contrast to the reporting surrounding Exercise Vigilant Ace in December 2017, which involved hundreds of American and South Korean military aircraft, including F-22s and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , in a very public show of force. However, in something of a return to form, North Korean authorities are criticizing the Max Thunder exercise using well-established propaganda language . According to Yonhap , statements from the country’s state-operated Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) have decried the drill as a preparation for an invasion of the North, which is how officials in Pyongyang have routinely described U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers for decades. Earlier in May 2018, KCNA lambasted the United States and South Korea for bringing up the North’s abysmal human rights record, another long-standing point of contention. “This exercise targeting us, which is being carried out across South Korea, is a flagrant challenge to the Panmunjom Declaration and an intentional military provocation running counter to the positive development on the Korean Peninsula,” KCNA declared. “The United States will … have to undertake careful deliberations about the fate of the planned North Korea-U.S. summit in light of this provocative military ruckus jointly conducted with the South Korean authorities.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un during a meeting in Pyongyang in May 2018., KCNA This rhetoric, along with the threat not to participate in the summit with Trump and the decision to cancel the session with South Korean officials on the southern side of the demilitarized zone in Panmunjom, seem at odds with North Korea’s more conciliatory tone following a historic meeting between Kim and South Korea’s president Moon Jae In in April 2018. The North-South meeting originally scheduled for May 16, 2018, was supposed to be one in a series to lay the groundwork for implementing various proposals , which Kim and Moon had previously agreed to in principle in a joint statement. “This potential meeting [between Trump and Kim] has been agreed to, there are no additional conditions being stipulated,” White House spokesman Raj Shah had said on May 12, 2018, while appearing on ABC’s “This Week.” “But, again they [North Korea] — they cannot engage in missile testing, they cannot engage in nuclear testing and they can’t publicly object to the U.S.-South Korea planned military exercises.” But the apparent change in tone is not necessarily surprising. Kim appears to be negotiating from a position of strength and is clearly eager to see what concessions he can get the United States and South Korea to agree to in the meantime. Though the sudden burst of charged rhetoric may seem irrational, being able to arbitrarily set the terms for meetings and other engagements show that North Korea remains very much in control of the process, something that was very evident from the KCNA statement. “There is a limit to the amount of goodwill and opportunity [we, North Korea,] can give,” the official state news outlet said. “We will be keenly watching the future behavior  of the U.S. and South Korean authorities.” In addition, the regime in Pyongyang recently announced plans to host foreign media and other officials to witness what it says will be the “dismantlement” of its Punggye-ri nuclear test sit at the end of May 2018. As we and others have noted, this isn’t much of a concession , since North Korea’s scientists have likely gathered enough data to do future work using models and simulations instead, not to mention that there are serious questions about whether the mountainside could even withstand more testing. Still, Kim clearly did this with an eye toward extracting something in kind from the United States and South Korea. Helping pave the way for the summit with Trump might have been reason enough, but it now appears the premier is interested in seeing what else he can get in return. He could also be looking to receive additional rewards for the recent release of three American prisoners, including two that the regime arrested after Trump became president. Trump, at center, speaks to the press at Andrews Air Force Base flanked by Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang Duk, and Kim Hak Song after their release from North Korea., Al Drago/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP In addition, it is possible at the Kim is placating other factions within his regime who are not as pleased with the idea of negotiating more formal settlements with the United States and South Korea that could more permanently end the conflict on the Peninsula. North Korean authorities have long used the specter of conflict with the South and its allies in Washington as a means to exert control over the country and many of those individuals, who have spent their entire lives defying the international order, may not be pleased with the potential for greater foreign engagement. We have talked at length how Kim seems to have finally realized a firm grip on power in Pyongyang, but that control could erode rapidly as the realization of a possible deal with the U.S. and an end to the status quo draws near. Although Kim has purged many of powerful North Korean leaders, the remaining power players that have spent their lives benefitting from the military stalemate with the South may very well see the young ruler’s engagement with long-standing enemies as radical. So far, there has been no public response from the Trump Administration, which has been very active in promoting the meeting with Kim. If the summit falls apart it could be a major blow for a president who styles himself as an experienced negotiator. For the government in Pyongyang, the only major risk appears to be a return to the tense status quo on the Peninsula. Updated: 5/16/2018 An English translation of the KCNA statement regarding the planned Trump-Kim summit is now available. It attributes the remarks to Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea’s First Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The statement names U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton specifically and focuses some of its most pointed criticism at his proposal to apply a “ Libya model ” to North Korea. Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear program, which was still in the very early stages of development, in 2003. In 2011, a U.S.-backed intervention enabled rebels to topple the regime and execute the Libyan strongman. The statement also makes reference to Iraq, where dictator Saddam Hussein also gave up his nuclear ambitions and then ended up deposed in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Gwan’s statements as a whole only reinforce that Kim has no intention of giving up his nuclear arsenal, which he sees as the guarantor of his regime’s survival. On May 16, 2018, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also sought to distance Trump from Bolton’s comments. “There’s not a cookie cutter model on how this would work,” she said . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has now met multiple times with North Korean officials both in that capacity and as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had previously suggested that the Trump administration was considering offering economic incentives and sanctions relief in exchange for concessions short of North Korea giving up its nuclear arsenal. This could include the regime in Pyongyang agreeing to eliminate its stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and its intercontinental ballistic missiles .

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The loser to Lockheed’s YF-22 for the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, Northrop’s YF-23, has turned into a mythical beast of sorts within military aviation circles. Not only do throngs of aficionados and analysts alike (and maybe even the Lockheed !) think it should have won that competition, but unsubstantiated rumors of a design based on it living in the clandestine realm, at least for some time, have propagated over the years. The truth is a bit more complex than just the YF-23 being the ‘perfect’ jet in retrospect—it too had advantages and disadvantages. But one of the YF-23’s most exotic design elements that has been largely overlooked was the way boundary layer air was separated from the YF-23’s fuselage before entering its air inlet and feeding its very air-thirsty next-generation turbofan engines. Supercruise—the ability to fly for extended periods of time at supersonic speeds without the use of afterburner—was a key requirement of the ATF program. At the same time, so was low-observability (stealth). The goals of providing copious amounts of stable airflow to engines and an airframe that is hard to spot on radar can come in direct conflict with each other when it comes to designing a cutting-edge combat aircraft, and especially a super-fighter. The YF-22 and YF-23—competitors in the ATF contest. , USAF Elaborate ‘splitter plates’ and the designing of offsets that separate an air intake’s structure from the aircraft’s fuselage had been the norm for supersonic fighters prior to the ATF competition, but those concepts were not very conducive to stealth. Even a small gap between the intake and the fuselage can result in a radar cross-section increase where it matters most—from the aircraft’s forward hemisphere. Even the production F-22 design didn’t do away entirely with this feature, but Northrop’s YF-23 design did. The YF-22 had a number of features that helped control airflow to its engines, including offset intakes and vanes that opened up above the engine inlet., USAF Notice how the F-22A’s air intakes are still split off from the fuselage, isolating boundary layer airflow. Low observable structures and radar absorbent coatings are used to help reduce the impact of this configuration on radar cross-section., Tyler Rogoway/author The issue has to do with boundary layer air that spreads around the aircraft’s fuselage as it flies. Boundary layer air can propagate at a different velocity and flow direction compared to the air that is offset from the aircraft’s surface and is freely gobbled up by the aircraft’s intakes. Mixing the two is far from ideal and can lead to large drops in engine efficiency, thrust instability, or worse. During certain regimes of flight, boundary layer air can become highly turbulent, largely impacting the engine’s performance or even suffocating it. The idea is to provide uniform airflow through the entire intake opening. At supersonic speeds these issues are compounded. Other restrictions on stealth aircraft design—including the lack of variable geometry inlets, large bleed air doors, vents, and maneuvering ramps and cones used to slow down the air being ingested by the aircraft’s engines at supersonic speeds—makes providing huge volumes of stable air to high-power engines even more problematic. S-shaped air ducts not only hide highly reflective engine faces from radar waves but they also slow down the air enough during supersonic flight (up to around Mach 2) so that the engine can suck it down without shockwaves disturbing its operation. But this doesn’t solve the boundary layer issue. YF-23, USAF So instead of creating separate intake structures with splitter gaps underneath the YF-23, Northrop installed ‘gauzing panels’ atop and ahead of where the fuselage meets the leading edge of the air intake. These panels had small holes drilled all over them and would ‘suck-up’ the boundary layer air ‘sticking to’ to the fuselage before it entered the air intake. This air was then vented out of a flush aperture and a pair of small doors on the YF-23’s upper surface. In effect, it acted like an invisible splitter plate of sorts but instead of separating the air it removed it. The system was called the Boundary Layer Control System and worked automatically. YF-23’s gauzing plate that removed boundary layer air before entering into the intake. , Valder137/Wikicommons Valder137/Wikicommons As a result, the YF-23’s engine inlet design was incredibly simple. It didn’t ‘hang’ below the fuselage as a discrete structure, instead, its trapezoidal shape simply terminated into the lower fuselage itself. In this sense, it was very much a part of the fuselage. And considering there aren’t really any known major complaints about the F119 and F120 engines’ overall stability during YF-23 high-speed testing, this concept seemed to have worked well. The system may have even helped the YF-23 best the YF-22 is supercruise performance, as well. USAF You can clearly see these panels in photos of the YF-23, which some have wrongly attributed to an unpainted part or stealthy baffles of some sort. Having holes drilled into splitter-plates wasn’t new. It had been done many times in the past to remove the boundary air that began to manifest itself on the plate itself before entering the engine. For instance, the Eurofighter EF2000 has this feature on its upper splitter plate that is easy to spot. The Super Hornet also uses it on the inside of its intakes. Older aircraft, like the F-4, also used perforations on their splitter plates to remove air clinging to the intake’s surface. But integrating a more refined version into the jet’s fuselage itself and eliminating the splitter plate or intake offset altogether was new. EF2000 intake., Valder137/wikocommons Notice the small holes in the inner-forward section of the F/A-18 Super Hornet’s intake., USN You are probably wondering why we haven’t seen similar technology in other designs in the nearly three decades since the YF-23 took to the air. One major reason is the advent of the Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI). This concept uses a forward swept intake design and a large hump-like structure blended with the fuselage of the aircraft to keep boundary layer air away from the inlet and to slow supersonic air entering the inlet to supersonic speeds. You can check out Lockheed’s patent on their DSI technology here. , US Patent The technology was successfully tested by Lockheed in 1996 with an F-16 acting as the test platform. The test concluded that the inlet had no adverse impact on engine operation could actually improve thrust during certain areas of the flight envelope. It could also reduce radar cross-section from the forward hemisphere by better obscuring the engine’s fan face. F-16 DSI test aircraft from the 1990., Lockheed Martin F-16 DSI test aircraft at Fort Worth in the 1990s., Lockheed Martin Since then, the F-35 went on to leverage it as a key design element, as has China with their J-20 and J-31 stealth fighters aircraft and the most recent iterations of their J-10 and JF-17 fighters. In fact, there are some indications that Northrop may have been planning on integrating a DSI-like structure on their production example of the YF-23 if it had ever reached that state. F-35’s DSI arrangement., Lockheed Martin J-20 uses a large DSI configuration., Chinese Internet J-10B with its DSI inlet., Chinese Internet It isn’t clear just how the two concepts stack up to each other though. The DSI and S-shaped duct arrangement is known to limit high-speed flight to around Mach 1.6-2.0 depending on the design. This really isn’t an issue for modern fighters but it could be for an exotic design that is meant to reach higher sustained speeds, although skin heating issues begin to come into play then as well. So there you have it, a little known exotic aspect of Northrop’s legendary YF-23 design, and another reason to sit back and wonder what could have been.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 27, 2019",A-10 Warthogs May Stop Firing Controversial Depleted Uranium Ammunition For Good,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force is looking to get new ammunition for the A-10 Warthog’s iconic GAU-8/A Avenger cannon and is debating whether it should buy rounds with armor-piercing cores that don’t contain controversial depleted uranium. Amid a shift in focus across the U.S. military toward preparing for high-end conflicts against conventional adversaries , the service needs to replace its stockpiles of the existing tank-busting shells as they are reaching the end of their shelf lives. Military.com was first to report on the possible change in the shell’s construction. The simplest alternative available to the Air Force would be to replace the depleted uranium in the armor-piercing cartridges, known as the PGU-14/B, with another dense metal, such as tungsten . The DU shell is one of two primary combat rounds for the A-10s, the other being the PGU-13/B high-explosive incendiary type. The two are commonly mixed together in the aircraft’s magazine at a ratio of five armor-piercing rounds to every high-explosive one. “There’s a lot of discussion of whether we’re going to use depleted uranium again, or the tungsten penetrator,” Bob DuPont, a member of the 780th Test Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, told Military.com earlier in May 2018. “We’re going to try to keep the weight the same, but it will have a less penetration capability because of the density of the material, DU [depleted uranium] being more dense than tungsten.” At present, the design of the PGU-14/B features an actual projectile with a solid depleted uranium penetrator sitting inside an aluminum jacket. A lightweight “windscreen” that keeps the entire unit aerodynamically stable until it hits the target, at which point momentum carries it forward to break through armor and other barriers. In addition, DU is pyrophoric, meaning that it spontaneously ignites when it is exposed to normal air, giving the rounds a secondary incendiary effect without the need for any other filler material. A diagram showing the components of the shell on the PGU-14/B round. “Heavy metal” in this case refers to the DU core., USN The ammunition can pierce through inches of rolled homogenous steel armor even at extended ranges of over 1,000 yards away. The A-10 also has the benefit of being able to attack at steep angles or from a vehicle’s rear to focus fire on the typically less well-protected portions. Since they fly at a high velocity and do not rely on an explosive charge, rounds such as the PGU-14/B are less vulnerable to active protection systems , too. But the rounds are getting to a point where they might no longer be safe to use. The average age of a PGU-14/B cartridge is 32 years, according to Military.com. In a fast firing system such as the GAU-8/A, which shoots around 70 round per second, if the primer and propellant detonate too slowly, it could damage the gun and the plane as a whole. Complete rounds for the GAU-8/A., Orbital ATK “I have 4.5 milliseconds from the time I initiate that round to get the projectile out the muzzle,” DuPont told Military.com “Anything beyond six milliseconds is catastrophic for this system.” Since the ammunition needs replacing, it’s as good a time as any to see whether the rounds’ other components need an update. And though they have been in use for decades, the depleted uranium rounds are increasingly controversial. A byproduct of producing fuel for nuclear reactors, DU is not only denser than similar metals, such as tungsten, but significantly cheaper and more readily available. The U.S. military has used the material to build both armor penetrators and armor plating. It also happens to have a mild radioactivity – generating only alpha particles that clothing and even human skin can block – and there are studies that suggest it might be a toxic carcinogen. The latter issue is more worrisome to activities, especially since the penetrators shatter and burn after impact, potentially contaminating soil and groundwater or just chucking DU dust into the air. In Iraq in particular, where American military units used large volumes of DU ammunition during invasions in 1991 and 2003, there has been a reported uptick in certain types of birth defects and cancers. Veterans of the First Gulf War cited exposure among the potential causes of what became known as Gulf War Syndrome . The U.S. government says that there is no conclusive evidence linking the rounds to the health issues, which is true. At the same time, however, Iraq has been a nearly perpetual conflict zone for 15 years, making it difficult for researchers to gain access and conduct long-term impact studies that would likely put the issue to rest for good. At the same time, the U.S. military has only slowly begun to release its own data regarding just how many shells it fired and where , which would help scientists determine whether the correlation is actually evidence causation. “So far no health problems associated with DU exposure have been found in veterans exposed to DU,” the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says on its own webpage dedicated to the issue. “Researchers and clinicians continue to monitor the health of these veterans.” Whether or not the health concerns are as real and pronounced as DU’s critics contend, the ammunition continues to be a hot-button issue. For a time, it looked as if it might be increasingly a moot point, as well. In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist, the U.S. military had been primarily focused on battling terrorists and insurgents who did not have the benefit of heavy armored vehicles. Though the A-10 was actively engaged in those operations, it often did so without PGU-14/B rounds. An A-10 fires its GAU-8/A cannon during a training exercise., USAF During the U.S.-led intervention in Libya in 2011, the Warthogs notably conducted operations without the armor-piercing ammunition. In the opening stages of the conflict against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, this was again the case. “The ammunition is developed to destroy tanks on a conventional battlefield,” a spokesperson for top U.S. task force leading the coalition fight against ISIS told me in 2015. “Daesh does not possess large numbers of tanks,” they added, using the Arabic acronym for the terrorist group. This changed later that year during Operation Tidal Wave II in Syria, which targeted ISIS-controlled oil infrastructure and distribution networks, including a series of spectacular strikes on larger numbers of tanker trucks. It remains unclear why Warthogs employed PGU-14s during those missions as the targets were all unarmored vehicles. It is possible that the plan was to avoid setting the oil alight, but as noted, DU has its own incendiary characteristics. We also don’t know how widespread the use of the armor-piercing ammunition was at the time or has been since then. There are multiple, standard ammunition loads for the A-10 that do not include the PGU-14. https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkG-RWxFfY https://youtube.com/watch?v=8IC-GzY2SRw In its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, the Air Force specifically requested funds to purchase a so-called “urban mix” for the A-10s, which is a blend with two-to-one ratio of PGU-13/B high-explosive incendiary rounds and largely inert PGU-15/B training practice types. In February 2018, a spokesperson for the Air Force’s top headquarters for operations in the Middle East and Central Asia said Warthogs had not used this ammunition loadout in Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan. But with renewed tensions between the United States and its allies and Russia , China’s continued push to expand its military capabilities and physical presence in disputed areas of the Pacific region, and the ongoing need to guard against the potential for open conflict with North Korea, armor and anti-armor weapons and ammunition are increasingly relevant again. In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration announced a return to “ great power ” competition and the U.S. military as a whole announced it would refocus on the primary mission of being prepared to fight against a large-scale, conventional opponent. It’s increasingly less certain that limited conflicts will be free of heavier weapons, including tanks and other armored vehicles, as well. This has become especially apparent in Syria, where U.S. forces and their local partners are increasingly facing off against a mix of formal state military and security forces, government-sponsored militias, terrorist groups , and a number of foreign proxies of varying levels of capability . In February 2018, a large force consisting of militiamen aligned with Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad, along with Russian mercenaries who may have direct ties to the Kremlin, attacked American positions in the eastern portion of the country. In the ensuing battle , U.S. aircraft and artillery drove off the enemy after destroying hostile armor and artillery. Later that month, an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone destroyed another T-72 tank linked to those groups. As such, armored vehicles and anti-armor weapons have seen something of a renaissance broadly. It’s unlikely that the A-10 and its ammunition loadouts haven’t come up in these discussions, despite the Air Force’s continued efforts to retire the aircraft. The Air Force looks to be taking the opportunity to see whether it makes fiscal sense, if nothing else, to abandon DU in favor of tungsten. It could be an easy public relations victory, but depending on how much more expensive the latter metal is, it might not make sense in the context of purchasing hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Tungsten is also less dense than DU and may be less effective in penetrating armor. Though less politically charged, a new version of the PGU-14 could limit the effectiveness of the A-10’s main gun. It could also force pilots to make more gun runs against particular targets to ensure they are destroyed, potentially reducing the total number of targets each aircraft could engage per sortie. Daylight shines through the rusting hulk of a thin-skinned M113 armored personnel carrier that A-10 pilots use as a target at Cannon Range near Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri., USAF This could be a significant issue against a conventional opponent fielding large armored formations in a high-end conflict. The Warthog’s gun is ideally suited to that kind of target density, but only if the ammunition is suitable for taking out the hostile vehicles in question. And with no conclusive scientific evidence that the material is a health hazard, the U.S. government has stood firm on continuing to use it for military applications. The Trump administration is unlikely to pressure the service to abandon the existing ammunition configuration, either. As a candidate and after having become president, Trump himself has decried what he sees as rules and regulations that prevent the U.S. military from “ winning .” In 2017, his Secretary of Defense James Mattis rolled back previous plans to largely eliminate cluster munitions , which were aimed at addressing international criticisms of those weapons. Whatever happens, there’s no debate that the A-10s will continue to need a specialized armor-piercing shell for the foreseeable future, whether there is radioactive metal at the center of it or not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 8, 2018",Marine RQ-21 Blackjack Drones Are Flying Three Times More Than Expected In Iraq and Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps has been using Boeing Insitu’s RQ-21 Blackjack unmanned aircraft so much in Iraq and Syria that it had to shift funds around earlier this year to help pay for unexpected operational costs. It’s yet another example of the insatiable appetite for aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support across the U.S. military , as well as a desire within the Marines to better integrate the drones into the service’s operations as intelligence gathering and electronic warfare platforms , and more. In February 2018, the Pentagon approved a U.S. Navy request to reallocate nearly $18 million from other portions of the 2016 and 2017 fiscal year defense budgets to support Marine Corps RQ-21 operations. This included pulling funding from the U.S. Army’s Tactical Signals Intelligence Payload program, which has reportedly run into trouble due to poor test performance, and line items that support Marine RQ-7Bv2 Shadow unmanned aircraft operations. In addition, more than half of the total money was already left over after lower-than-expected costs associated with the Blackjack operations in previous years. “The U.S. Marine Corps has identified a spares and sustainment shortfall in FY 2018, due to RQ 21 flight hours for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) exceeding budgeted flight hours by more than 300 percent,” the reprogramming document explained, using the official nickname for operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon, as with any federal agency, must seek congressional approval to use funds lawmakers approved for one particular purpose to pay for something else. The request offers no additional detail about what the RQ-21s have been doing in the Middle East in the fight against ISIS. However, for years now, the Marine Corps has been actively supporting both Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq and local, predominantly Kurdish partners in Syria, as well as U.S. and other coalition special operations forces advising those groups in both countries. An RQ-21 Blackjack sits on its catapult, ready for launch., USMC Most notably, the Marines provided precision artillery support, primarily with M777 155mm howitzers firing GPS-guided shells, during the lead up to the liberation of the city of Mosul in Iraq and throughout the campaign to eject ISIS from Raqqa in Syria . These locations represented the terrorist group’s main centers of gravity in the two countries. With an endurance of up to 16 hours and a range of approximately 50 miles, the Blackjacks could have spotted targets for artillery units and assessed the results of those strikes. With its sensor turret containing both electro-optical and infrared cameras, as well as a laser marker, it could help identify targets for other friendly forces, including fixed and rotary wing aircraft. On top of all that, the drones would have been able to perform overwatch missions for friendly forces, keeping an eye out for the sudden appearance of enemy forces or potential ambushes. Navy personnel wheel an RQ-21 to its launch catapult onboard the landing platform dock ship USS Mesa Verde ., USN Highlighting how ubiquitous and important American unmanned aircraft have become for operations in Syria especially, there have been growing reports that the unspecified “adversaries,” likely Russian or Russian-support forces, are increasingly trying to jam them in certain parts of the country. Available information has suggested that smaller, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, such as the RQ-21, are particularly vulnerable due to the relatively limited power of their data and control links. In addition, using other drones as communication relays, the aircraft can effectively double its maximum range, further extending the area that might be able to cover. For operations in the region against ISIS, especially in Syria, this could be especially beneficial since the operating locations are often in remote, austere areas that might be physically separated by substantial distances from other supporting elements or even the deck of an amphibious assault ship. The RQ-21 is also well suited to those types of sites since it uses a catapult to launch the unmanned aircraft and a tethered hook to snatch it out of the sky at the end of its mission. Unlike similarly sized drones, such as the RQ-7, the Blackjack has no need for an actual runway of any kind. The complete system, which consists of five RQ-21s, a launcher, a Skyhook Recovery System, two trailer-mounted generators, and four Humvees with various other necessary components and pieces of equipment, is relatively mobile, as well. Marines work to disconnect an RQ-21 from the Skyhook Recovery System after a mission., USMC And while the Marines need the extra funds at the moment specifically due to operations in Iraq and Syria, the Blackjack’s heavy use in that theater strongly suggests that this will increasingly be the trend for the service’s operations in general. This unmanned aircraft is already the primary type support Marines at the Regimental and Marine Expeditionary Unit levels, occupying a space between lighter, hand-launched types and larger drones, such as the MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper . The RQ-21’s small operational and logistical footprint makes it especially good for the Marine Corps’ expeditionary operating concepts broadly, even though it has a slightly shorter maximum range than the RQ-7Bv2. The service plans to completely replace its Shadows with the Blackjacks by the end of 2019, at which time it will have four operational units with the latter type, according to the 2018 Marine Aviation Plan. Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron Three will complete its transition in 2018, leaving just Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron Four flying the Shadow. Marines move an RQ-7 Shadow off the runway after a mission., USMC In 2018, the Marines also plan to expand the Blackjack’s payload options with the AN/PDY-2 Split Aces radar and the AN/DSY-4 Spectral Bat signals intelligence suite. There are also plans to integrate a version of the Intrepid Tiger electronic warfare system into the RQ-21. The Split Aces systems is an active electronically-scanned array radar with synthetic aperture and ground moving target indicator functionality, which will allow it to track and monitor moving vehicles, as well as capture radar imagery in any weather condition. Spectral Bat is a signal detection and geo-locating system that also has a secondary electronic support function, allowing operators to spot and classify certain emitters. Intrepid Tiger is a communications jammer that can also monitor enemy transmissions. A AN/ALQ-231(V)3 Intrepid Tiger II electronic warfare pod on a Marine UH-1Y helicopter., USMC It’s not clear whether a single RQ-21 might be able to carry one or more of these systems at once, along with its existing sensor turret. However, a single complete “system” with five drones fitted with a mix of this equipment could dramatically expand the capabilities of Marine expeditionary forces, giving them options to locate enemy forces, jam their transmissions, and alert other elements to the presence of hostile sensor or communications nodes. In addition, the drones could provide at least semi-persistent surveillance over a particular area or of a specific moving target for offensive and defensive purposes. All of these capabilities could be very important for relatively small units to maintain an advantage while operating in a distributed manner without necessarily having the benefit of immediate direct or indirect fire support . It could also be a boon for maneuvering in dense urban areas , which is another increasingly likely conflict environment. The RQ-21 has already demonstrated its ability to carry the Redkite lightweight wide-area persistent-surveillance system, as well. The manufacturer, Logos Technologies, says a drone flying at 12,000 feet can use the sensor to grab imagery of a five-by-five mile square area. Data links can then transmit that feed to ground stations for further exploitation in near real time. In March 2018 , Logos brought one of the drones with the sensor package to the Advanced Naval Technology Exercises (ANTX) at the Marine Corps’ Camp Pendleton in California. A RQ-21 with the Redkite wide-area persistent surveillance sensor package., Insitu This would allow Marine units, include reconnaissance and special operations elements, to develop so-called “ patterns of life ” about a specific target or small group of individuals. Understanding their routines and typical movements could help in the planning for a raid or strike that eliminates as much collateral damage and as many civilian casualties as possible – a process known to the U.S. military as finding, fixing, and finishing the enemy, which also happens to be the motto of the Navy’s RQ-21 program office. The US Navy’s RQ-21 Blackjack program logo. The service manages these aircraft on behalf of its own units and the Marine Corps., USN The Blackjacks may eventually be able to carry miniaturized munitions themselves in order to directly strike targets they come across in the future. There are a steadily increasing number of suitably diminutive precision-guided bombs and missiles . In 2007, an older MQ-5B Hunter reportedly conducted a strike in Iraq using a GBU-44/B Viper Strike munition, a clear demonstration of the utility of drones of this size in an armed role. Textron has already demonstrated versions of its RQ-7 with small weapons, too. The video below reportedly shows an MQ-5B using a GBU-44/B to strike militants in Iraq. Another possibility is that the RQ-21s could serve as spotters for new loitering munitions that the Marine Corps is also interested in acquiring to give additional firepower to smaller units. AeroVironment has already pitched the concept of employing its Switchblade man-portable suicide drone together with its hand-launched, but longer-range RQ-20 Puma unmanned aircraft. And given the aforementioned growing concern about jamming, the Marines may look to install anti-jam data and control links and encryption capabilities to prevent an opponent from intercepting and decoding the data streams from the aircraft. If developments in Syria and Western Europe over the past 18 months are any indications, these threats exist now and will only become more pronounced as time goes on. The Blackjacks are definitely a key component of the Marine Corps larger desire to add drones to their concept of operations where ever possible from small, hand-held quad-copter types for infantry squads and platoons to large unmanned aircraft to conduct much more far-reaching operations with traditional aircraft and helicopters as part of a manned-unmanned team. The RQ-21, though, is significantly cheaper to operate than larger Predator- and Reaper-sized drones and already offer a wide array of capabilities, albeit on a more limited, localized scale. This could make them an attractive and cost-effective option in many cases, even as new, more capable systems, such as the Marine Corps’ proposed Marine Air Ground Task Force Unmanned Aircraft System-Expeditionary, or MUX , become available. With the Marine Corps set to push toward adding the new RQ-21 units in 2018 and 2019, and test the various new payloads at the same time, the service looks set to continue expanding its use of the drones where ever it might find its units deployed. And it will have to budget funds to match that increased operational tempo in the coming years to avoid any more shortfalls.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 25, 2021",Israel Uses Drone Racers To Down Incendiary Kites And Drones To Dispense Tear Gas Over Gaza,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The age of low-end drone warfare is officially upon us, and nowhere is this reality being made more apparent than along the Gaza-Israel border. Weeks of violent protests by Palestinians along the fenceline have given birth to ‘incendiary kites’ as a robust asymmetric warfare tactic that we detailed in a previous piece. Now Israel is putting hobby-like drones to use to knock down those flaming kites, and even to release tear gas on protesters from across the fenceline. Facing more indiscriminate wildfires as a result of the Palestinian’s incendiary kites, the Israeli Defense Forces came up with a novel countermeasure to a very simple yet vexing tactical problem. They enlisted local drone racers to set up along the border and fly their maneuverable and fast drones into the kites or snag them with fishing hooks to bring them down. The program kicked off officially last Friday and it’s not clear just yet how successful the racers were over the weekend, but video posted on Youtube did show a drone hauling away a kite caught on a hook: Also, on Saturday a kite with what appeared to be an improvised explosive device was found in Israel—the first of its kind. Haaretz writes : “The explosive did not detonate when it landed Saturday near the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, a few hundred meters from Israel’s border with Gaza. Police sappers that examined it suspected that it was a dud or even a fake. However, they say it could point to a new phase in Gazans so-called “kite terrorism” against Israel, one they fear could be used Monday as tens of thousands of Gazans will protest on the border as part of Nakba Day.” Today there have also been a number of headlines about Israel using quad-copter-like drones to dispense large volumes of tear gas onto Palestinian protesters below. The action along the Gaza-Israel border has been especially intense and deadly over the last 24 hours as the U.S. officially opened its new embassy in Jerusalem. At least 52 Palestinians died and many more were wounded as tens of thousands swarmed the fencelines in protest of the opening. The idea of using drones to dispense tear gas isn’t brand new. A number of companies have been marketing solutions to do just that to military and law enforcement agencies for a number of years. But Israel seems to have been first to use the tactic back in early March of 2018. Since then it has been used sporadically on multiple occasions, but today market the largest and most high-profile employment of the tear gas-wielding drones ever. The use of drones to deploy tear gas comes primarily in two flavors. One is using the drone as a dispersal platform, actually spreading the aerosol formula as it flies overhead. This is less invasive, less dangerous, and less effective than the other form, in which a larger drone drops canisters of tear gas down onto protestors below. Doing so does risk harm from the impact of the falling canisters. It seems that the IDF has quickly gone from the first method to the second over the last two months. AP For years I have been trying to paint a picture of how low-end drones would change conflict zones of the future. Now, many of these predictions have come to pass. From dropping bomblets on vehicles in urban battles, to attacking traditionally hardened targets with large groups of expendable drones that can overwhelm traditional air defenses that were really never designed to defend against such diminutive targets, the age of drone warfare has arrived. In fact, Israel, in particular, has been farther ahead of the curve in this regard than any other country. MOHAMMED ABED/AFP/Getty Images But don’t just assume that using these flying machines even for less-than-lethal purposes is something left to conflict areas thousands of miles from U.S. shores. Here at home, local police departments have been cleared to use similar devices on American citizens. Nearly three years ago, North Dakota outright legalized the use of drones for ‘less than lethal’ law enforcement purposes, including remotely firing rubber bullets, pepper spray, and tear gas at crowds. Since then, there is an expanding market for law enforcement drones that can launch small payloads—like tear gas canisters—and the decreasing price of drone technology is making them more accessible to local police departments. But some may see the adaptation of drones as less than lethal weapons platforms as a low-rung subject despite its dystopian connotations. The bigger debate is over allowing domestic drones to actually kill people. And that is not some science fiction proposition. History was made in Dallas, Texas in 2016 when a robot was used to kill an active shooter suspect, an act that largely a sign of things to come. You can read our whole report on it here. Regardless of how creepy all of this is, it will increasingly become the new normal. Putting all feelings aside, for Israel in particular, the tear gas drones make great tactical sense as they allow the IDF to disperse large crowds that congregate well beyond the fenceline, out of the reach of IDF personnel. And they do so without putting those soldiers at risk. At the same time, the drone represents a form of tyranny in many parts of the world—a faceless judge, jury, and executioner that drastically benefits the technologically superior foe. But it’s worth remembering, that as the technology continues to proliferate and becomes more accessible, it will increasingly work both ways. Just as ISIS leveraged hobby and homemade drones to rain down bomblets on Iraqi forces, Palestinians could one day sick their own hobby drones on IDF forces or Israeli interests across the border. In fact, the developed state’s drone monopoly, big and small, is quickly coming to an end, and the technology is actually far more concerning when in the hands of non-state or even individual actors . https://youtube.com/watch?v=bjBK7wTeLCU Above all else, the operational use of drones as tear gas dispersal platforms is yet another reminder that they can be used to deliver far more deadly aerosols. Considering drones are now being used to dust crops, even off the shelf technology could give nefarious actors with the world’s most deadly weapons the ability to rain down death on unsuspecting citizens below in an incredibly efficient and low-risk manner. This is likely one major reason why Israel has taken such a hard line when it comes to foreign drones—most notably those operated by Iran and their proxies—penetrating its airspace. Considering it is thought that Syria retains chemical weapons capabilities, the possibility that such a deadly payload could end up on an Israeli-bound drone is terrifying to say the least.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Sep 13, 2018",U.S. Lawmakers Want To Axe Funding For New Surveillance Planes To Monitor Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Members of Congress want to nix the U.S. Air Force’s plans in its latest budget request to replace two U.S. Air Force OC-135B surveillance aircraft and have proposed a provision that would make it illegal to do so until Russia returns to compliance with the Open Skies Treaty . That agreement, which allows both countries and other parties to legally fly aerial reconnaissance missions over other member states’ military facilities, has become increasingly controversial , but sticking with the old planes could put American crews at risk and would seem to put the United States at an inherent disadvantage in capability. On May 9, 2018, in a session to amend and approve the latest draft version of the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2019 fiscal year, the formal title for the annual defense budget, the House Armed Services Committee removed the more than $222 million the Air Force had wanted in order to buy a pair of new aircraft to take on the Open Skies mission. The Committee and other assembled legislators approved the new version of the bill, which does retain nearly $6 million for upgrades to the two existing OC-135B aircraft, in a 60-1 vote. The funding allocations could change again in the future as the House and the Senate work to align their respective versions of the law before putting the final iteration up for a formal vote. “Russia has violated key arms control treaties, expanded and modernized its nuclear arsenal, tested counter-Space weapons, and used emerging technologies to undermine its neighbors,” a statement that the House Armed Services Committee released after the so-called markup said. As such, Committee Chairman, Texas Republican Mac Thornberry was “withholding funding for Open Skies Treaty aircraft and sensors until Russia again complies with the Treaty and takes other steps, including agreeing to extradite Russian nationals who have been indicted for their actions against the United States during the 2016 election.” The Open Skies Treaty entered into force in 2002 and presently includes 34 member states. The agreement allows any of them to fly limited surveillance missions over the territory of another with prior notice using aircraft equipped with relatively low-definition, visual cameras. One of the two OC-135B Open Skies aircraft., USAF The ostensible goal of the deal is to improve transparency regarding peacetime military activities. The underlying concept is that if member states can directly observe and verify the nature of maneuvers and internal deployments and redeployments in neighboring countries, they are less likely the fear that these developments are actually a prelude to a sneak attack or other malign actions. This, in turn, is supposed promote stability between countries that might otherwise be skeptical of each others’ true motives. To help enforce the treaty and provide the U.S. government with a capability to exercise its rights under the agreement, the U.S. Air Force’s 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska operates two specially configured OC-135B aircraft. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a U.S. government agency charged with both monitoring developments regarding weapons of mass destruction and also working to reduce the threat of conventional conflict, provides a portion of the crew during the actual mission. A redacted breakdown of the various locations supporting the Open Skies mission, including main and forward operating bases, as of 2010., USAF via FOIA But the OC-135Bs are among the oldest aircraft in the 55th Wing and are likely some of the oldest in the Air Force as a whole. These planes rolled off the production line in 1961 as C-135B Stratolifter cargo aircraft. The service subsequently converted them into WC-135B weather reconnaissance planes, before turning them into their present configuration. So, in its fiscal year 2019 budget proposal , the Air Force has asked for funding to buy two new “small airliner class aircraft” to replace them. It’s not entirely clear what type of planes the service had in mind, as the description could apply to more traditional commercial-type passenger aircraft, such as varied as the Boeing 737 , or increasingly popular business jet-sized designs such as the Gulfstream G500 and G600 series or the Bombardier Global Express . A US Air Force C-40 personnel transport, which is derived from the Boeing 737 airliner., USAF If the Air Force determined it could fit the necessary equipment and crew into a bizjet-sized platform, it could have offered a particularly cost-effective replacement for the larger, but aging OC-135Bs. The service already operates various types based on the Gulfstreams, including plans to purchase new variants as an electronic warfare aircraft , as well as the Global Express-based E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), which could have further reduced operating and logistics costs. At the same time, it and other branches of the U.S. military fly militarized 737s , which might have made that an attractive option, too. If nothing else, the Air Force had rightly determined that it needed some sort of replacement for the increasingly obsolete OC-135Bs sooner rather than later. These planes use four Pratt & Whitney TF-33 turbofans, an inefficient low-bypass design that first entered production in 1959 and that the company hasn’t made since 1985. Their predominantly analog mission systems and other onboard equipment are increasingly unsupportable, as well. A US Air Force E-11A Battle AIrborne Communication Node aircraft, which is a modified Bombardier Global Express., USAF Mission availability rates for the two OC-135Bs are becoming a major issue, both in terms of capacity to meet the demands of the Open Skies Treaty and for safety and security reasons“The aircrews are being stranded in Russia for weeks at a time, put in really awkward situations,” Don Bacon, a Republican Representative for Nebraska and retired Air Force brigadier general who had previously led the 55th Wing, said, according to a report by the Omaha World-Herald . The World-Herald said it had obtained a document showing that in 2016 an OC-135B flying over Russia had to abort its missions due to electrical problems that were so severe it needed an airworthiness waiver to leave the country two days later. When the crew tried to return home, however, the aircraft’s pressurization system caught fire, filling the main cabin with smoke. After getting the situation under control and safely transiting a mountain range, the plane diverted to a still undisclosed location for emergency repairs. The Air Force is struggling to address similar issues with its two WC-135 nuclear reconnaissance aircraft , as well, which are similarly old and are also increasingly limited by the TF-33 engines. Though it scrubbed the OC-135B replacement program from the budget, the House Armed Services Committee kept in funding to pay for three newer WC-135R aircraft the Air Force plans to convert from KC-135R aerial refueling tankers with more modern CFM-56 turbofans. The service is also in the process of putting those tankers through a major Block 45 upgrade program that will give the aircraft new glass cockpits and other updated mission systems to keep them viable through at least 2040. All of this underscores the residual issues with any older C-135 types that will remain in service. On top of these basic reliability problems, each OC-135B one carries three KS-87E framing cameras and a single KA-91C panoramic camera, which are all wet film types. This means that the crew has to land and send the film off for processing – a task that specialists at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio perform – before analysts can even begin to take a look at the imagery. The House’s latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act does retain the funding to replace those systems with four digital cameras, as well as upgrade the aircraft’s ADS-B transponder and other unspecified minor updates. The video below offers an inside look at one of the OC-135Bs. But those improvements won’t do anything to address the aircraft’s underlying age. And House Armed Services Committee’ Chairman Thornberry’s decision to hold off on new aircraft until Russia complies with the treaty would appear to only limit the U.S. government from taking legitimate advantage of the agreement in the meantime It goes without saying that the Kremlin has steadily sought to erode the basic tenets of the deal in recent years. In 2017, the United States raised concerns anout Russian authorities having limited requests from member states to send aircraft over Moscow and its heavily militarized Kaliningrad enclave on the Baltic Sea , as well as Chechnya and Georgia’s pro-Russia breakaway region of South Ossetia. While the Chechnya issue has since been resolved, the others remain points of contention. A major sticking point is that Russia is of the opinion that South Ossetia, as well as Abkhazia, are independent countries who haven’t ratified the Open Skies treaty and are therefore not subject to its provisions, while the United States sees these largely unrecognized states as part of Georgia. In September 2017, the U.S. government responded by restricting Russia’s requests for flights over parts of Alaska and Hawaii. The Kremlin has a great interest in the expanding ballistic missile defense infrastructure in the former, repeatedly accusing the United States of developing those systems to challenge its nuclear deterrent capabilities. In reality, there is no way that the ballistic missile defense shield would be able to counter a Russian strategic strike. Also at issue is that the Russians want to upgrade the sensors on their Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft, which the U.S. government says will violate the limits on image fidelity in the agreement by adding modern infrared or radar imaging systems, though there is nothing in the treaty that specifically prohibits these types of systems. Critics of the treaty as a whole say that the Kremlin, which has far more limited satellite surveillance capability, gets much more out of the agreement than the United States. Russia’s Tu-214ON Open Skies aircraft., Oleg Belyakov via Wikimedia Though this might be true, there is a good argument to be made that the treaty offers numerous less tangible benefits , primarily in helping to hold Russia accountable and forcing them to be transparent about their military developments, as well as giving smaller countries the ability to do the same. While the United States might not need the imagery Open Skies provides, its participation in the agreement gives added weight in the demands of small states, including those with much more active concerns about Russia’s intentions, such as Ukraine. It also makes it clear that the U.S. and its partners are not willing to let the Kremlin unilaterally dictate changes to long-established international norms, which the Russians are actively looking to challenge at every available opportunity to suit their interests. “They [critics] think we don’t get a lot out of it, but the Russians do,” Representative Bacon said, according to the World-Herald . A Ukranian An-30 aircraft. Ukraine uses specially configured An-30B surveillance aircraft to conduct Open Skies missions., bomberpilot via Wikimedia Insisting the Air Force rely on increasingly dubious aircraft for the mission would seem to only limit the ability of the U.S. government to exercise its rights under the treaty, regardless of Russian compliance. This would appear to only provide the Kremlin with exactly what it wants, while at the same time making it increasingly dangerous for the crews to fly in general. There’s no clear description in the House Armed Services Committee’s statements about how hamstringing American capabilities would help push Russia back into full compliance, either. “We made the case to the [committee] staff. I saw a softening of their position,” Bacon told the World-Herald . “I think we’ve got more fertile ground for 2020.” US Air Force personnel clear snow off of one of the OC-135B aircraft at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska., USAF At that point, it will have pushed the timeline for getting any new Open Skies aircraft back further with only limited updates to the existing aircraft. The Air Force’s fiscal year 2019 budget proposal also indicated plans to ask for almost $45 million in the next cycle to help continue the program. In the interim, OC-135B will have to perform their mission as best they can within the increasing limits of the aircraft, and do so hopefully without any serious incidents that put the crews in danger or worse . Correction: The original version of this article stated that Russia had denied, rather than limited flights over Kaliningrad and did not note that Russia and the United States have resolved the Chechnya issue. Additional clarification was added to those points, as well.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 6, 2018","Mothership’s Day: China’s New Carrier Sets Sail, French Fly From USS George H.W. Bush","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Two hemispheres and two very different aircraft carrier stories to cover. China’s first indigenously produced aircraft carrier, and their second carrier overall, has left its berth at the shipyards in northeastern Dalian for the first time. The vessel, which was officially launched a year ago , disappeared into the early morning fog as it headed out on initial sea trials Sunday morning. Meanwhile, French Navy aircraft, including E-2C Hawkeyes and Rafale Ms, are conducting carrier qualifications and interoperability training aboard the USS George H.W. Bush as the supercarrier sails in the Atlantic off Norfolk. China’s entry into the carrier aviation space has been breathtaking to observe. In 2012, China’s first carrier, the Liaoning , was commissioned. It was rebuilt out of the rusted hulk that was the Soviet-era Kuznetsov class carrier Riga— a vessel that was acquired through a complex gambit of international business dealings and espionage. The rusted hulk that is now Liaoning arriving in China after being towed from Ukraine., Chinese Media Less than four years after it was commissioned it and its air wing were deemed fully operational and ready for combat. Now, two years later, China’s first homemade carrier based on Liaoning —known in China as the Type 001A—has become a reality. And Beijing didn’t just clone the Kuznetsov class turned Type 001 design entirely, they improved upon it in many ways. Photo by China News Service/VCG via Getty Images The Type 001A visually differs from the Liaoning in some very apparent ways. Most notably, its island superstructure has been totally redesigned. It now includes another glazed deck allowing for the bridge and flight control areas to be separate. It features a new faceted upper area to accommodate four electronically scanned radar arrays—reportedly of the Type 346 S-band radar system. AP Although taller, this new island has a reconfigured and streamlined footprint that adds more deck operating space to the Kuznetsov design. Other parts of the deck have been tweaked as well to maximize operating space. Changes to the ship’s bulbous bow and screw-rudder layout have also been mentioned in the press. Type 001A (left) and Type 001 (right)., Chinese Internet The ship’s ski-jump has also been changed , with a 12-degree slope instead of 15 on the Liaoning . Supposedly this is optimal for China’s J-15 fighters. The big angled missile launchers buried in the Kuznetsov class’s deck, which China abandoned when it refurbished the Liaoning , have been totally deleted from the revamped Type 001A design. This provides drastically more room for flight operations-related spaces. The ship’s hangar bay has also been enlarged as a result of the removal of the launch tubes and by finding efficiencies elsewhere in the design, which includes installing smaller and more modern subsystems. These and a number of other smaller changes allow for the Type 001A to carry more fighters and sustain their operations for longer with more fuel and ammunition. Estimates range from this new sub-type being able to accommodate between three and eight more aircraft. The ship’s combat systems and electronics are also totally modern, which will provide much higher situational awareness, reliability, and combat capability, with the carrier working more dynamically as the center of the battle group. Armed-up J-15s line the deck of the Liaoning . , /AFP/Getty Images) Yet even with these changes, and the swapping out of older, bulkier systems for new smaller ones, the ship’s displacement supposedly increased by about 5,000 tons. Although still relying on steam boilers for propulsion , Type 001A’s power-plants are supposedly more efficient, powerful, and reliable than their rehabbed Soviet-era counterparts, which will more than makes up for the displacement growth in terms of performance. AFP/Getty Images Really, this ship is all the Kuznetsov class could and should have been. Some state that once this vessel is operational, the Liaoning will work more as a training and reserve ship than a frontline carrier. That is highly debatable as China’s carrier capability is still in its infancy. It’s more likely such a plan will only come to pass if and or when a second Type 001A is completed. China will supposedly be moving on to catapult-assisted takeoff and barrier-assisted recovery (CATOBAR) carrier configuration for aircraft carrier builds, with this ‘Type 002’ configuration supposedly already under construction . But it’s possible we could still see another Type 001A built concurrently or even in the future depending on how the Type 002 program develops. A second carrier definitely puts China out of the niche or developmental capability club when it comes to naval aviation power projection capabilities. Considering how much Beijing has been putting Liaoning to use, this second vessel will bring about an entirely new level of Chinese naval presence in the region. But above all else, the fact that China could reverse engineer and build what is by all estimates a far better ship than its predecessor, is stunning and is even more evidence that the country is well on its way to fielding a world-class carrier force without needing to rely on external help. The yet to be officially named Type 001A is slated to become operational in 2019. Halfway around the globe, the Marine Nationale is deep within their much-anticipated deployment to the United States to train with their U.S. Navy counterparts and to operate aboard the USS George H.W. Bush . Dubbed Chesapeake 2018 , the training exercise is especially crucial for French naval aviators and the crews that support them as France’s only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle , has been undergoing a complex mid-life overhaul that began over a year ago and still has a ways to go before being completed. This means France’s naval air wing has not been able to receive carrier qualifications for well over a year. But that’s all changing with the help of the U.S. Navy. Here are some shots from the USS George H.W. Bush of France’s Rafales and Hawkeyes in action: USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN USN France’s carrier-capable aircraft use the same launch and recovery infrastructure as their American counterparts, allowing them to fly off the decks of U.S. Navy supercarriers, and vice-versa. With the tightening military relationship between the U.S. and France, and both French and American presidents spearheading a closer strategic relationship overall, the possibility of an operational deployment of French aircraft aboard an American carrier is increasingly possible. The same can be said for U.S. Navy aircraft joining France’s carrier air wing during a cruise aboard their carrier once it’s back in service. We previously discussed this possibility in our post reporting on plans for the French visit the U.S. for exercise that is now underway: “Longer-term cross-decking used to be a more common occurrence decades ago. In particular, American carrier-borne Navy squadrons would occasionally spend time operating aboard Royal Navy CATOBAR configured carriers and vice-versa. This practice was largely curtailed once HMS Ark Royal , the last Royal Navy CATOBAR carrier, was retired in 1979. But this practice looks to be on the verge of a renaissance of sorts, and not just because Rafales are deploying to the USS George H.W. Bush . The USMC F-35Bs will be among the first aircraft to deploy operationally aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth. The Royal Navy even built a special USMC space within the ship in anticipation of near constant cooperative USMC-Royal Navy F-35B deployments. Considering that multiple other allied Naval arms are now interested in making their helicopter carriers F-35B capable, and procuring small lots of the jets themselves, this practice could become far more widespread. It remains unclear if a future multi-national carrier cruise between the Marine Nationale and the U.S. Navy at the squadron level will ever occur, but after this exercise it may be far more plausible than any time in the past few decades. Even a small deployment of say six French Rafales-Ms and a Hawkeye could be integrated into an existing air wing for an upcoming operational cruise, and there is plenty of room on American supercarriers’ decks these days to accommodate a foreign aircraft contingent. During the Cold War, Nimitz class supercarriers would carry upwards of 90 aircraft, today they commonly deploy with around 65, and many of those aircraft derivatives of the Super Hornet. “ We are truly entering into a renaissance of carrier aviation. China, India, and the UK are all in process of building multi-carrier fleets. Meanwhile, the F-35B is making high-end strike fighter capabilities attainable to naval arms that can’t afford, or have no plans on building large carriers. Japan and South Korea , in particular, are looking at modifying ships they already have to accommodate the F-35B, and it’s likely that others, like Australia, will follow. The potential availability of surplus USMC AV-8B Harriers could also make fast-jet carrier aviation a more attainable reality for other countries that can’t afford or are not allowed to acquire the F-35B. Yet China’s marathon effort to bring serious power projection via naval aviation to its seagoing service is the most dizzying of all, and it is impacting the procurement decisions of its regional peers dramatically. India, in particular , is looking to check China’s growing naval aviation prowess with its own indigenous carrier design and roadmap that will eventually bring CATOBAR capability to its Navy. But above all else, one thing is certain, after decades of decline, the aircraft carrier is becoming a must-have weapon of war for many countries once again.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jul 24, 2020","These Are Real Pentagon Reports On Warp Drive, Extra Dimensions, Anti-Gravity, And More","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The modern understanding of the Pentagon’s relationship with unexplained flying phenomena has become remarkably more pointed in the last six months since the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was uncovered. Its disclosure came in between our own exclusive reporting on two very strange and well-documented encounters with strange aircraft operating in U.S. airspace. Now, new documents are coming to light that show the Department of Defense’s own spy agency was also interested in subjects that border on science fiction and the even the paranormal, including warp drive, extra-dimensional manipulation, dark energy, and other highly exotic forms of space travel. The documents were first discovered by George Knapp’s I-Team , part of Las Vegas CBS affiliate Channel 8 News, which has been investigating the government’s supposed connection with ‘UFOs’ for decades. Author’s note 5/14/18: It has come to our attention that the documents were in fact first posted by Corey Goode late last year shortly after the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was first disclosed. Recently Knapp has been digging deeper into Bigelow Aerospace —which is located in Las Vegas—and its starring role in the previously classified program. It is no secret that Robert Bigelow, a former real estate developer turned inflatable space station entrepreneur, has been highly interested in UFOs, but the depth of the company’s official relationship with the Defense Department regarding the topic was something entirely unheard of before the disclosure of the Defense Intelligence Agency’s (DIA) Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program occurred in December 2017. Abbreviated AATIP, that effort, and its funding, sprang from Nevada Senator Harry Reid’s interest in the topic, along with that of a Defense Intelligence Agency official. The program, which eventually cost $22 million and ran roughly between 2008 and 2012, began after Bigelow won the contract, apparently to investigate UFO sightings, along with pretty much everything else that goes along with the topic for better or worse, on behalf of the military. A team of nearly 50 scientists, analysts, and investigators were assembled to work on the program, which was originally and very cryptically dubbed the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications (AAWSA) Program before gaining its more recent moniker. The contract between the DIA and Bigelow made sure not to spell out its focus, instead referring to exotic technologies without mentioning UFOs. The I-Team writes: “The agreement with DIA did not mention UFOs at all. It used more generic terms such as future threats and breakthrough technologies, and specified 12 focal points including, lift, propulsion, materials, versions of stealth as well as human interface and human effects.” Real estate mogul and Bigelow Aerospace chief Robert Bigelow., AP It was under the AAWSA name that the organization funded at least two studies into advanced propulsion and space technology research that border on the fantastical. The first of these studies , dated March 29, 2010, deals with “advanced space propulsion” for faster-than-light travel, discussing theoretical physical constructs such as “spacetime-altered regions” and “gravity/antigravity” forces. The second study , which the AAWSA program published on April  2, 2010, covers similar ground, but also includes discussions about “dark energy” and “extra dimensions.” The AAWSA experts did this work under the auspices of DIA’s Defense Warning Office, which makes good sense, at least conceptually. This organization first came into being in 2002 and is “charged with identifying sources of increasing threats to U.S. interests in critical regions,” according to an official briefing . One of the figures from the March 2010 report., DIA via Las Vegas Channel 8 “This office will also identify opportunities to affect adversary behavior prior to and in the early stages of a crisis.” that presentation notes. In 2003, these tasks expanded to also include work “to provide the earliest possible warning of technological developments that could undermine U.S. military preeminence.” UFO sightings are often indications of advanced and secret military aircraft research and development projects. Having a team of experts try and determine if any of the reports translated to real programs, especially those that potential opponents such as Russia or China might have been working on, would be well with DIA’s mandate for the office. That AAWSA team would have delved into known developments in associated fields would also make sense in this context. If America’s adversaries were rapidly advancing toward practical warp drives and other advanced propulsion and space research, DIA would definitely want to know in order to help inform U.S. policy responses. “These studies are so loaded with information,” Senator Reid reportedly said at one point, according to Las Vegas’ Channel 8. “One thing we learned is over the decades a lot of things happen there’s no explanation for. Well there are now.” Nevada Senator Harry Reid., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP But the applicability of these studies to the Defense Warning Office’s core mission seems dubious, as do portions of the underlying research itself. Neither report suggested that the technology they described was anywhere near practical or that any foreign government was close to achieving a relevant breakthrough. “This paper has considered the possibility—even likelihood—that future developments with regard to advanced aerospace technologies will trend in the direction of manipulating the underlying spacetime structure of the vacuum of space itself by processes that can be called vacuum engineering or metric engineering,” the March 2010 study says in its final discussion section. “Far from being simply a fanciful concept, a significant literature exists in peer-reviewed, Tier 1 physics publications in which the topic is explored in detail.” “The idea that a sufficiently advanced technology may interact with, and acquire direct control over, the higher dimensions is a tantalizing possibility, and one that is most certainly worthy of deeper investigation,” the second document concludes. “Of course, this may not be actualized until many years in the future, but consider the many spectacular physical phenomena that are believed to be true at this early point in the 21st century.” What these statements do clearly reflect is the vision of the primary “contractor” for these studies, EarthTech International, Inc., a small firm headquartered in Austin, Texas. This company no longer has a functional website and otherwise has a virtually non-existent presence on the internet. “We strive to translate these ideas into laboratory experiments,” according to an archived copy of the company’s website from 2017. Here’s a clip from a 60 Minutes segment with Bigelow that was filmed before the revelations about his involvement with the Pentagon’s Aviation Threat Identification program were exposed: A cursory internet search on EarthTech’s CEO Harold Puthoff, Ph.D., who authored the March 2010 study, and Eric Davis, Ph.D., another employee who co-authored the other report, quickly turns up a web of links to Bigelow and his other fringe scientific and paranormal investigative endeavors, including the now defunct National Institute for Discovery Science, or NIDSci . You can find a mirrored copy of that entity’s website, circa 2008, here . Independent consultant Richard Obousy, who helped produce the April 2010 document, also has connections to the Nevada businessman. Puthoff is now Vice President of Science and Technology at To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science, a non-profit organization that reportedly is, at least in part, continuing the AAITP’s work independently. Luis Elizondo, who was the government head of AAITP and its follow-on guise, is its Director of Global Security and Special Programs. The full extent of the AAWSA effort, including how many similar studies it funded and at what cost, as well as the later AAITP, still remains unclear. So far, two videos the latter iteration of the group examined in detail have captured the most public attention through the media. F/A-18 Hornet Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) targeting pods shot both of these clips and they feature small “tic-tac”-like objects racing around at high speed over the water. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Fd6ssvcBoM But the main video and pilot account wasn’t new when news of the existence of AAITP first broke. It had been floating around in defense circles for over a decade, but more open disclosure about the origin of the video on an official level, as well as subsequent interviews with the pilot that took it, certainly elevated it to mainstream news. Beyond that, accounts of Bigelow’s special unit’s investigation include claims that mysterious material from downed objects was being stored in storage lockers and that the program went far beyond documenting and evaluating eyewitness reports of UFOs. Instead, it took a holistic approach, which may have included evaluating the impact on human biology in association with sightings and other unexplained events and even seemed to have delved into other paranormal domains. This would seem to match up with the picture of the program’s work we now have based on the documents Knapp’s I-Team obtained. What we know for sure, beyond the basic facts surrounding the project and information that Elizondo, the guy who led the program on the DoD side, has given to the press, is that some very strange studies resulted from its mandate. Once again, the studies Las Vegas’ Channel 8 uncovered are official DIA documents that the United States Government paid EarthTech and other Bigelow associates to produce and kept on file for its own internal use. If nothing else, the existence of these studies supports the perception that this program went far beyond just trying to interpret and document eye-witness accounts of UFOs and trying to identify what was buzzing around in earth’s atmosphere. And they are bound to leave just about anyone wondering if this is what has been released, imagine what else exists that hasn’t, whether out of fear of embarrassment or risk to national security.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For two years, B-52s took the fight to ISIS in Iraq and Syria and pounding targets in Afghanistan with the help of their new smart bomb racks . In total, the forward-deployed bomber force based at Al Udeid in Qatar flew some 1,850 sorties and dropped around 12,000 weapons on enemy targets. During their stay, they beat the B-1B’s record of 761 consecutive missions without a maintenance cancellation by 73 missions, for a total of 834. The B-52, more lovingly known as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fellow), officially flew its last mission in the Middle East on April 7th, 2018, with the B-1B taking up station once again in the theater. But we are still getting some awesome imagery from the B-52’s historic deployment, like this 360 video of a BUFF crew recovering at sandy Al Udeid Air Base. Here is a direct link to the facebook video if it does not pop up below. The B-52 has some very unique flying characteristics. It can climb with its nose depressed below the horizon, and its big slab-sided fuselage and vertical tail make it a giant sail during cross-wind landings. But Boeing engineers built-in an ingenious solution to alleviate the B-52’s cross-wind woes—it’s gear can be locked inline with the runway’s heading, allowing for crews to ‘crab’ the jet into the wind all the way to touchdown. You can read more about the B-52’s unique landing abilities in this past article of mine . Regardless, the video is a great showcase of the how ‘hands-on’ a B-52 landing is even in relatively benign conditions. Watch the pilot’s control inputs as the big bomber floats down towards the runway. Also of note all the info written in grease pen on the cockpit windows, and during rollout, it appears that the crew quickly installs safeties on their ejection seats. The venerable B-52 is going to be around for a long, long time. Current USAF plans have pushed the bomber’s service out to at least mid-century. Now that it is finally going to get new engines , Boeing’s masterpiece of mayhem will be more capable than ever before and could very well end up serving well past its centennial of operations.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 19, 2018",This New Video Showing DARPA’s Master Plan For Its Gremlins Drones Is Awesome,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just last April, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) selected its team for the final phase of its reusable air-launched and recovered Gremlins drone program. Now DARPA is laying out exactly how the final concept will work and what it aims to prove with flight testing in an awesome new explainer video complete with high-end animation of the final Gremlins configuration in action. The $32M contract will support the program and its flight testing between 2018 and 2020, after which time DARPA sees the concept moving into an operational state. The team that won the tender is led by Dynetics, with Williams International, Moog, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Systems Engineering, Inc., and its previous competitor for the contract, Kratos , acting as subcontractors on the program. The concept and its many affiliated technologies are widely viewed as a gateway to a new revolution in air combat—one that could become very lucrative to the players involved with Gremlins as its all but guaranteed that the USAF will rush the capability into an operational state once DARPA’s involvement in the program winds-down. The video highlights the cooperative swarm concept behind Gremlins. This includes the ability to readily adapt each vehicle to carry different payloads (up to 150lbs), and once networked together they will equal more than the sum of their parts. Secure line-of-sight data-link communications and a level of autonomy that allows the swarm to instantly react to its tactical environment are also cornerstones of its operating concept. We have discussed all these ideas in depth years ago , but seeing them being packaged openly in the non-classified realm is truly exciting and indicative of what likely exists in the clandestine realm. We also get to see the whole process of aerial recovery in action, having gotten just a glimpse of it in the recent past. The program aims to culminate in being able to recover four Gremlin drones aboard a single aircraft within 30 minutes. Once recovered, the hope is that the Gremlin drones can be refurbished and refueled within 24 hours for another sortie. Each drone is supposed to have a design life of at least 20 missions. What’s nice about this concept is that as the drones age out they could be used for more risky tasks or even as kinetic weapons themselves as part of a larger swarm. A DARPA press release states: In addition to preliminary flight tests, the team has focused on risk reduction via extensive modeling and simulation. The team looked at how fifth generation aircraft systems like the F-35 and F-22 respond to threats, and how they could incorporate gremlins in higher risk areas. The gremlins’ expected lifetime of about 20 uses could provide significant cost advantages by reducing payload and airframe costs, and by having lower mission and maintenance costs than conventional platforms, which are designed to operate for decades. A C-130 from International Air Response is currently acting as the mothership for Gremlins testing, but a variety of other transports could be used for an operational iteration of the concept. DARPA’s release says: The C-130 is the demonstration platform for the Gremlins program, but Wierzbanowski says the Services could easily modify the system for another transport aircraft or other major weapons system. Modularity has made Gremlins attractive to potential transition partners. “We are exploring opportunities with several transition partners and are not committed to a single organization. Interest is strong with both the roll-on/roll-off capability of the Gremlins system—as it does not require any permanent aircraft modification—and a wing-mounted system to provide greater flexibility to a wider range of aircraft,” said Wierzbanowski. The video also clearly states the advantages of an air-launched and recovered system like Gremlins. These positives include smaller airframe sizes, decreased dependency on air base proximity, less cost per mission, and the promotion of distribution of multiple disparate sensors within a single swarm. As a result, these advantages provide a higher capacity for risk-taking, both operationally and developmentally speaking. We will continue to keep a close eye on the Gremlins program as it enters its final proof-of-concept phase, but above all else, it is another indication that an age of autonomous unmanned air warfare is upon us.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 18, 2018",The U.S. Military’s Niger Ambush Investigation Raises More Questions Than It Answers,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After some seven months, the U.S. military has publicly detailed the results of its investigation into the circumstances surrounding an ambush in the West African country of Niger that left four Americans dead , focusing heavily on failures in the mission planning and approval processes. Not only are many of conclusions presumptive and otherwise difficult to believe, they seem aimed, at least in part, in obscuring how much combat the regional counter-terrorism mission actually involves as a whole. U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), briefed the press on the findings on May 10, 2018. U.S. Army Major General Roger Cloutier, the command’s chief of staff and the individual who lead the investigation, and Robert Karem, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, joined him. The inciting incident occurred on Oct. 4, 2017, when Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) terrorists attacked a combined force of American and Nigerien personnel near the village of Tongo Tongo, but resulted from activities that began days before. “The team inaccurately portrayed the concept of operations for the first of three total missions on three and four October [2017],” Waldhauser said in his opening remarks . “Although the evidence from the investigation indicated that this event was neither a standard practice nor commonly accepted, it underscores the confusion at the time over understanding the special operations component CONOP [concept of operations] approval process.” The general also identified other key findings regarding the force, also known as Team Ouallam after its primary base of operations, a location that The War Zone was first to publicly report the existence of after the ambush. The element, which included members of the U.S. Army’s 3rd Special Forces Group and attached personnel from other U.S. Army units, was improperly prepared for its deployment to Niger before leaving the United States, failed to adequately engage with Nigerien partners ahead of its initial operation, and did not conduct its own internal pre-mission rehearsals. U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, at center, briefing to the press on May 10, 2018, about the investigation into the ambush near Tongo Tongo., DOD The Official Narrative “Taken collectively, these items dealing with Team Ouallam’s preparedness call into question the oversight and supervision provision responsibilities at various levels within the SOCAFRICA chain of command,” Waldhauser added. He said that punishments, as well as awards for valor during the ambush, will follow the investigation, though the public summary of the report assigns no direct blame for the incident. The general added that he had already made changes to the approved equipment for units in Niger and elsewhere in Africa, including what vehicles that could have available to them. That the team had been riding in unarmored trucks at the time had quickly captured the public’s attention in the aftermath of the incident. He had also initiated a review of the mission planning and approval processes, as well as the requirements for units before and during deployments to the continent. Other commands, including Special Operations Command, will initiate their own reviews based on the findings to identify any relevant shortfalls in readiness, training, and other policies and report those to Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Major General Cloutier and his team reportedly traveled to six different countries, interviewed more than 140 individuals – including a Nigerien survivor of the attack and locals in Tongo – collected physical evidence and reviewed reams of other information before producing a report some 6,000 pages long. The official overarching conclusion was that “no single failure” led to the events that occurred near Tongo Tongo. U.S. Army Major General Roger Cloutier, US Africa Command Chief of Staff, who oversaw the investigation, talks about his findings on May 10, 2018., DOD The summary of the investigation and the remarks at the formal briefing can only be seen as highly critical of Team Ouallam’s actions. It accuses the team leader of hastily copying and pasting details about the newly proposed mission into an existing template, which gave a false sense of plan’s scope. According to the official narrative, the initial CONOP document implied that the team’s main objective was to meet and engage with local Nigerien leaders, a common practice to form relationships and gather intelligence. In reality, it was a mission to kill or capture a senior member of ISGS, Doundou Chefou, also known by the code name Naylor Road. The acting commander of special operations forces in Niger, situated in the country’s capital Niamey, approved this mission, despite knowing its true intention and not having the authority to do so. Yet another special operations headquarters, in neighboring Chad – an element known as a Special Operations Command and control element, or SOCCE – has to approve raids on known terrorists in the region and may end up sending those requests higher up the chain of command to its own superior units, situated in Germany, according the Pentagon’s public summary and the remarks at the briefing. With the inappropriate orders in hand, on Oct. 3, 2017, the complete force – consisting of 10 Americans, 34 Nigeriens, one U.S. “intelligence contractor,” and an interpreter, according to a separate report from ABC News – moved out to investigate a site to the north near the village of Tiloa, where they thought Chefou was staying. After failing to find any terrorists in the area, they moved to a nearby Nigerien outpost to meet with a local commander, receiving new information about the situation. A map showing the locations of the various elements of SOCAFRICA’s chain of command involved in the incident in Niger. The US special operations forces (USSOF) team in Ouallam is the lowest level. The chain of command then goes through the Advanced Operations Base (AOB) in Niamey to the Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE) in Chad, then to Special Operations Command Forward-North and West Africa (SOCFWD-NWA) in Germany, and finally to SOCAFRICA’s main headquarters, which is also in that country, collocated with AFRICOM’s headquarters., DOD At this point, the commander in Niamey briefed his superiors in Chad about the mission. Those officials subsequently ordered a second, larger mission with Team Ouallam acting as a backup force for a heliborne element that would depart from Arlit, which sits hundreds of miles to the northeast. Weather forced that second team to abort their mission and Team Ouallam proceeded alone, again failing to locate Chefou. It was on the return from that second mission that the group stopped near Tongo Tongo to meet again with other local leaders. The ambush occurred after that so-called “key leader engagement” on Oct 4, 2017. During that multi-hour firefight, terrorists overwhelmed the Americans and their Nigerien partners, killing Sergeant First Class Jeremiah Johnson, Staff Sergeant Bryan Black, Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, and Sergeant LaDavid Johnson, all members of the U.S. Army. Two more U.S. personnel suffered wounds and a number of Nigeriens died or were wounded in the incident. A mix of American, Nigerien, and French forces subsequently arrived in the area. French Mirage 2000 multi-role combat jets and gunship and transport helicopters were particularly instrumental in driving off the ambushers and evacuating the surviving members of the combined force. During the fighting, Sergeant Johnson got separated from the main group, but he was not captured, as earlier reports had suggested. His body remained missing for two days. You can read more about the exact timeline and particulars of the ambush itself here . Nigerien troops take up positions near an unarmored truck during the Flintlock 2018 training exercise., US Army Changing missions or stories? The investigation’s timeline and conclusion of the events leading up to the ambush are certainly plausible. Special operators in Niger, eager to locate Chefou, who is linked to the kidnapping of American aid worker Jeffery Woodke , may well have wanted to jump on actionable intelligence without having to wait for approval. However, for this story to hold up, it requires a number of implicit assumptions. Many of the core conclusions from the investigations are simply hard to understand given the overall context. If the CONOP that Team Ouallam had submitted was misleading, how, as the Pentagon claims, was their commanding officer in Niamey aware of the true nature of the mission? The only explanation here is that this second officer was engaged in a conspiratorial plan to launch an unapproved kill-or-capture mission without seeking approval from his own superiors – something Major General Cloutier made clear his investigators had determined was not the case. And if the team knew it was heading out on a raid to capture a known and dangerous terrorist from the beginning, why did they appear to only be prepared for the more limited key leader engagements outlined in the CONOP? By all accounts, including a captured helmet camera video that later became public, the American personnel were lightly equipped and in unarmored vehicles without any heavy weapons throughout the entire course of events. The Pentagon investigation showed that some were not even wearing body armor at the time of the ambush. A still frame from a helmet camera video a US special operator shot during the ambush, which ISGS terrorists later included in a propaganda video claiming responsibility for the attack., via Military Times In addition, the investigation clearly insinuates that if an accurate CONOP had made it to the headquarters in Chad, officials there would have rejected the plan. There is no publicly available evidence to support this conclusion. During the briefing, Waldhauser acknowledged that while this was the first time this particular team had conducted a kill-or-capture mission of any kind, the unit they had replaced had done so in the past. On top of that, after the team arrived at the initial location near Tiloa and did not find Chefou, the commander in Niamey willingly decided to inform his superiors about a mission he had apparently authorized under false pretenses instead of just ordering the force to return to base without incident. And when officials in Chad became aware of what was actually happening, instead of putting a stop to what would have appeared to be a “rogue” mission, they immediately ordered additional forces into the area. Those individuals also informed their superiors in Germany, who made no attempt to stop the mission. All told, the Pentagon’s official narrative is the following. An improperly equipped and ill-prepared team of Americans and Nigeriens set out on an inappropriately approved mission. When their superiors discovered the operation already in progress, not only did they not order the unit to stand down, they immediately moved to send additional forces into the area. When that plan fell through, those commanders, who were in regular contact with their own superiors, ordered the original team, poorly suited to the task as it was, to continue with the mission anyway. This chain of events, if accurate, would seem to imply gross negligence at every part of the chain of command. The alternative, that these decisions somehow occurred without mutual agreement at all levels that the mission was valid or was at least worth pursuing in spite of the initial inaccurate CONOP, strains credulity. Nigerien troops jump from a pickup truck during a training exercise., USN At the same time, if there was a mutual agreement up and down the chain of command, this would strongly seem to contradict the idea that the original CONOP was misleading. If nothing else, it would indicate that these types of mission planning problems were, at least to some degree, a routine occurrence and that commanders would be inclined to take them in stride, regardless of how Waldhauser characterized this particular incident. Furthermore, reporters at the press conference rightly questioned how it would have been possible to employ limited aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources to cover a particular site, as the Pentagon itself says occurred on Oct. 3, 2017, over Tiloa, within the context of key leader engagements and not prompt questions about the true focus of the mission. Waldhauser said that the commander in Niamey had direct control over the still unspecified aircraft at the time, but offered no further details as to how the request for that support had proceeded initially. The official review of the incident also presents a key detail in the reverse order compared to how it appeared in press reports that emerged in the months following the ambush. The initial indication was that the second team in Arlit had asked for support in its kill-or-capture mission, nicknamed Operation Obsidian Nomad, and that American commanders at some level had decided to retask Team Ouallam with that mission. After that, most of the press coverage seems to align with the Pentagon’s narrative. An American special operator observes Nigerien troops during a training exercise in Chad., US Army A broader operation Again, it’s not impossible that Team Ouallam went out initially on a mission that the appropriate authorities would have rejected had the known about it in advance or that various details leaked out to the press backward. But in concluding that this incident was somehow a unique confluence of events initiated solely by the actions of one small unit, intentionally or not, the Pentagon has not had to publicly address whether the picture it paints publicly of operations Niger aligns with the reality on the ground or acknowledge any potentially covert components in the country. “Today, approximately 800 DOD [Department of Defense] personnel are in Niger, a country that is nearly twice the size of Texas, in support of a region-wide, multi-national effort, largely focused on building the capacity of local security forces,” Assistant Secretary of Defense Karem said during the May 10, 2018 briefing. “Of the 800 personnel, only a small fraction are special operations forces engaged in efforts to train and equip our partner forces or provide advise, assist, and accompany support for Nigerien forces.” Niger hosts the second largest number of American military personnel anywhere in Africa. The bulk of U.S. forces in the country do appear to be dedicated to running drone surveillance missions , and now strikes , from the base in Niamey, as well as working to establish a larger facility in the city of Agadez further to the northeast. US Air Force personnel walk toward an MQ-9 Reaper drone in a hangar in Niamey., USAF “None of these special operations forces are intended to be engaged in direct combat operations,” he added. “U.S. military activities in Niger are conducted at the request of the host nation.” This is, almost certainly, a technically accurate description of the overarching regional counter-terrorism mission, nicknamed Operation Juniper Shield. Karem, along with General Waldhauser and Major General Cloutier, emphasized the so-called “ by-with-through ” approach that is supposed to emphasize training and working with local forces rather than taking direct action. But we at The War Zone know, having obtained a heavily redacted copy of the Execute Order, or EXORD, of that operation via the Freedom of Information Act, that it might not be an entirely honest depiction of the mission at hand. This order, dated 2012, which Karem also cited in his remarks as providing much of the present underlying guidance and authority for counter-terrorism efforts throughout North and West Africa, provides no-nonsense descriptions of the overall mission objective and the responsibilities of key forces. The official mission statement for Operation Juniper Shield, with redactions, as stated in the EXORD., AFRICOM via FOIA The first responsibility for Commander, SOCAFRICA, according to the Juniper Shield EXORD., AFRICOM via FOIA Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA) is specifically responsible for “operations, exercises, security cooperation and engagements” in support of the broader campaign plan. This list includes “operations” as distinct from “exercises” and “security cooperation,” which makes it clear that from the very beginning that there was the possibility for American personnel to find themselves on active missions, with or without partner forces. It also says that one of special operators’ main objectives in the region is simply to “disrupt and degrade” terrorists and the unredacted portions make no specific mention of having to do so in cooperation with partner forces. Even if this were the case, other examples of “advise, assist, and accompany” missions show that this can effectively put American personnel in a combat situation , regardless of the official terminology. In turn, U.S. military forces have in many cases suddenly found it necessary to engage in “ collective self-defense ” due to their proximity to the action. Waldhauser emphasized that what happened near Tongo Tongo was a matter of self-defense, as well. He also insisted that appropriate CONOPs make sure to keep American personnel as isolated from potential combat as possible. “So in other words, if there was a target to go to, our U.S. forces don’t go to that target. they stay – they stay behind, they – it’s a little bit of an art, not necessarily a science,” the general explained, letting slip the inherent flaw in this operating concept. “You can’t really say ‘You’ve got to stay back 500 yards,’ or ‘you can only go this close.'” Nigerien troops prepare for an exercise with US forces in 2017., US Army A separate task force In addition, the order names the previously unreported Task Force 27.2 as being a separate force that needs to “coordinate and synchronize” its activities with SOCAFRICA and support that command “as required.” This unit nomenclature is typically associated with elements of the secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), who are almost entirely focused on direct action missions and typically take the lead in doing so even when working with local forces. As we at The War Zone have previously reported , the operational nickname Obsidian Nomad strongly points to a JSOC mission, as well, based on previous information obtained via the FOIA. Publicly available information suggests that the command is also the entity responsible for operations at the American base in Arlit. That site does not appear in public documents that mention Ouallam and a half dozen other sites in Niger, including four more linked to SOCAFRICA. The brief section on Task Force 27.2 from the Juniper Shield EXORD., AFRICOM via FOIA There are also unconfirmed reports of the Central Intelligence Agency’s involvement in the operation, which the Pentagon denies . The Juniper Shield EXORD cites a 2005 memorandum of agreement between the Department of Defense and the CIA among its references, but it is unclear how that factors into the operation itself. It almost certain, though, that the CIA maintains strong relationships with the Nigerien intelligence apparatus. The agency’s activities in the country were central to a controversy in 2003 over reports that then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had actively attempted to purchase refined, yellowcake uranium, from the country, intelligence that turned out to be fraudulent . A map of known US operating locations in Niger, with special operations forces-related sites in red. Arlit is highlighted., Google Maps/The War Zone The U.S.-trained Bataillon Sécurité et Renseignement (BSR), or Security and Intelligence Battalion, the Nigerien unit involved in the incident, appears to be akin to similar elite special operations unit the CIA and special operations forces have formed in other countries, such as Afghanistan and Somalia , specifically to provide local support for more active operations. “Intelligence contractor” – the only title we have for another American who was present during the ambush – is a common euphemism for U.S. intelligence personnel, though they could have also been under contract with the U.S. military in the country. How Task Force 27.2, or the CIA’s paramilitary elements, fits into the chain of command and how its operations intersect with other special operations forces missions in Niger remains unclear. There is a strong indication that it is not uncommon at least for JSOC to work with the publicly acknowledged special operators in the country. That the so-called “white” and “black” sides of the mission can so easily find themselves in the same operational space raises serious questions about whether the U.S. military has adequate forces and other resources to conduct its riskier missions in Niger or elsewhere in the region – something we have already questioned given the reliance on contractor-operated planes and helicopters for casualty evacuation and personnel recovery missions. It also suggests that units ostensibly tasked with non-combat training and advisory activities can quickly find themselves in combat, regardless of their stated mission with little in the way of outside oversight. Nigerien security forces at the country’s anti-terrorism center in Niamey in 2016., Britta Pedersen/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Is anyone paying attention? U.S. lawmakers got their own closed-door briefing on the investigation into the ambush on May 8, 2018. Many of their responses only further support the idea that the actual scope of Operation Juniper Shield, and activities in Niger specifically, is or was broader than publicly understood. “That was a very explosive briefing,” Tim Kaine, a Democrat Senator from Virginia said afterward . “I have deep questions on whether the military is following instructions and limitations that Congress has laid down about the mission of these troops in Africa, and I’ve had those questions, and I think this hearing raised a lot more in a pretty explosive way.” Kaine also suggested that the public face of the mission in Niger was “a fig leaf” that “raises questions about why people are hiding from us what they’re doing.” There is, so far, no evidence that the Pentagon has been concealing the true nature of operations in North and West Africa from members of Congress, including those was the mandate to oversee such activities and who can request classified updates at any time. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine., Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP What the situation does highlight is the still amazingly broad latitude the U.S. military has to conduct operations around the world under the authority granted in the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF . Congress hastily passed that law in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which allows the Pentagon to launch missions anywhere against the Al Qaeda terrorist network, as well as largely undefined “associated groups.” ISGS is composed of individuals who had been part of Al Qaeda’s franchise in North and West Africa, went independent for a time, and then refused to join their brothers in arms who re-pledged their allegiance to that global terrorist network. The Pentagon has already cited the AUMF as the legal basis for operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and its franchise in Libya and almost certainly applies that same logic to operations against the group in and around Niger. Niger is under threat from or otherwise situated near areas where various other groups operate, as well, making the situation even more complex. The high fluid nature of those organizations and their allegiances call into question whether their motivations are at all global rather than local, as well as whether the U.S. military’s broad counter-terrorism strategy is truly applicable in containing them or addressing the underlying grievances that keep them in business. Within the halls of Congress, it is much more likely that lawmakers are just now waking up to what’s been going on across Africa for nearly two decades as a result of that law, if they weren’t actually aware already, and are beginning to question the basic logic of the operation. After the ambush, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, stated that he had no idea that there were nearly 1,000 American troops in Niger, despite being among those legislators most specifically charged with knowing these details as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham., Ron Sachs/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Critics have long questioned whether the AUMF is too broad, effectively giving the U.S. military a blank check to make connections between Al Qaeda and virtually any other terrorist group in the world based on even the most tangential connections. Congress is now set to debate a new AUMF to give proper legal authorization to various counter-terrorism activities around the world. The growing concern , however, is that this will only enshrine the existing status quo and reduce the ability for Congress, and by extension their constituents, to challenge the validity of those operations. The proposed legislation authored by Tim Kaine and Republic Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee does not fundamentally change the underlying language of the AUMF and only expands the number of groups the Pentagon can legally target anywhere. It’s not clear if this legislation will survive the latest revelations about Niger. Tenessee Senator Bob Corker., Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP “After the hearing yesterday we had huddled,” Kaine added after the classified briefing. “We are going to figure out a way that the story will be told and that people will be held accountable.” In the meantime, though, American military personnel continue their activities in Niger. Waldhauser says he has already initiated processes to improve the mission approval process and issues guidance to emphasize the “by-with-through” approach. But it’s not clear whether this will truly change the operational environment or just place a new emphasis on avoiding future situations that could drag U.S. military activities in Africa back out into the public eye.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Sep 7, 2019",Boeing’s Been Granted A Patent For Turning The B-1B Into A Gunship Bristling With Cannons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A B-1B Lancer ‘gunship’ may sound like something a kid doodles on his desk during a 4th-grade math class, but Boeing has actually been awarded a patent for just that. U.S. Patent 9,963,231 B2 was awarded on May 8th to Boeing. It depicts a number of cannon configurations that can be stowed in a B-1B’s weapons bays and extended down outside of those bays for use. Our good friend and marvelous patent sleuth Stephen Trimble of Flightglobal.com was the first to find the patent. The patent certainly envisions different concepts that could be used to convert the ‘Bone’ into a heavy-hitting gunship without making many if any permanent changes to its existing configuration or outer mold-line. The cannons are shown mounted in various manners with elaborate mechanisms that allow them to tuck neatly inside the B-1B. US Patent US Patent One includes a trapeze-like system that is mounted inside the aircraft’s cavernous weapons bays, and when the bay doors open it drops down and is turreted to fire in different directions. The other shows a few variants of a semi-recessed mounting configuration where the guns drop down into a semi-recessed fairing installed on the belly of the aircraft and are fired sideways from that position. US Patent US Patent US Patent US Patent As for the weapons shown, they look similar to M230 30mm cannons as well as the much larger Bushmaster cannon, which can run from 25mms to 40mms in size. One drawing even shows two different sizes of cannons mounted on the same turret side-by-side. The patent’s description directly refers to using the guns for close air support and ground attack. It also seems fairly clear that these concepts could be applied to any aircraft with a voluminous weapons bay, not just the B-1B. The idea being that these kits could be able to more easily turn existing aircraft into gunships, packing a huge amount of firepower in a small space via compact, mechanized, space-saving designs. Patent The patent also describes how being able to store cannons inside the aircraft, instead of leaving their barrels hanging out in the aircraft’s slipstream, results in certain benefits. These include the ability to go supersonic while toting around such weapons, increased range, better maneuverability and overall performance, and most interestingly, stealth: Patent Considering the future realities of warfare in anti-access and aerial denial situations, the idea of a stealthy gunship that can move faster and farther than an AC-130 without its massive radar signature is intriguing. Although stealthy transport and tanker aircraft have been and remain attractive concepts to the Pentagon, the B-1B is now slated to retire by around 2035 . Although very complex and costly to operate, the jet is fast, has considerable range, is built to penetrate enemy air defenses at low altitude, and has a degree of low-observability (stealth) baked into its design. With that in mind, maybe Boeing will one day pitch a B-1B gunship in an effort to save a number of the aircraft from retirement. USAF Such an initiative could also be eventually paired with the arsenal ship concept that seems to have been put on the back burner by the Trump administration. In addition, some of the designs put forward in this patent could also be adapted to field directed energy weapons—as in lasers—in the not so distant future. The B-1B has always been eyed as a platform for a surrogate for such a weapon, even in pop-culture. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4nKXjJ7O0s4 As it sits now, the AC-130J will be the first to receive a laser weapon, but the technology is progressing quickly and is certain to spread to other platforms not long after its initial operational iteration debuts. In fact, in a recent interview, Tom Palenske, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing, described how a tactical laser would be used just as we did a couple years ago, with Military.com Oriana Pawlyk writing : In the future, AC-130 crews also hope to incorporate a high-energy laser aboard the gunship. Palenske said the laser will be the ultimate ace in the hole, making disabling other weapons systems easier. “If you’re flying along and your mission is to disable an airplane or a car, like when we took down Noriega back in the day, now as opposed to sending a Navy SEAL team to go disable [aircraft] on the ground, you make a pass over that thing with an airborne laser, and burn a hole through its engine,” he said. Palenske was referring to Operation Nifty Package to capture and remove Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega from power in 1989, during which a SEAL team “disable[d] his aircraft so he couldn’t escape.” With a laser, “it’s just like that. And you just keep going on, and there’s no noise, no fuss, nobody knows it happened. They don’t know the thing’s broken until they go and try to fire it up,” he said. But it’s also worth pointing out that most of these patents never amount to anything but intellectual property in big defense contractors’ back pockets. Still, a similarly exotic patent we wrote about in the not so distant past just turned into a request for proposal (RFP) from the U.S. Navy, so you never know exactly where these patents could end up or if there is a hard plan in place for them at the time of their granting. When it comes to adding guns to an aircraft like this, much more goes into it than mechanical storage and employment concepts and there are certainly developmental pitfalls along the way. Just the gun’s recoil can be a major integration factor and targeting architecture is a whole other issue. But B-1B gunships? Who can’t hope for that, even if in an adolescent kind of way? Update: 6:45pm PST— The precision night striker B-57G also explored a somewhat similar concept under the ‘PAVE GAT’ program, here is video of it in action: Our own Joseph Trevithick also noted that General Electric had a design for mounting a row of miniguns that fired downward out of a weapons bay: General Dynamics illustration. The AP-2H TRIM (Trails Roads Interdiction Mission) Neptune also used downward-firing grenade launchers as well.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on May 8, 2018","Actionable Intel: Defense News Roundup For May 10th, 2018","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In a new segment we are testing called ‘Actionable Intel’ we roundup all the news that is important enough for us to post but doesn’t make sense for us to write a full article on at this time. From time-to-time it will allow us to keep updated on the cutting edge of critical stories without impacting the normal longer-format flow of the site. So here are the key happenings from around the globe that you need to know about: Israel Strikes Back : The War Zone had rolling coverage of the exchange on fire between Israel and Iranian operatives in Syria last night. We now have a clearer picture of just how extensive Israel’s counter-strikes were. Five types of Syrian air defense systems were destroyed in the barrage, which included a whopping 60 weapons—ten of those were surface-to-surface missiles. These could have been mix or guided artillery rockets, ground-launched Delilah-GL cruise missiles , and Spike NLOS missiles among others. During the operation, Syrian SA-22, SA-2, SA-5, and SA-17 batteries were destroyed . The SA-22 unit, a Pantsir-S1 point defense system, is the most interesting of the lot as it represents the best air defense capability Syria has against standoff weapon attacks on key targets. In total, Israel used 28 F-16 and F-15 fighter aircraft to execute the strikes. It seems fairly clear that the IAF was ready and waiting for a rocket barrage to occur in the days and hours that led up to the attack. Israeli press repeatedly warned that the IDF was tracking peculiar movements across the border in Syria and Israeli tankers were on station over eastern Israel for some time before the attack occurred. Above all else, the sheer size and brevity of the revenge strikes indicate a large pre-planned operation that would hit most known Iranian-related targets in Syria was ready and waiting to be executed. In total 23 were killed in Syria, 18 of which were foreign fighters according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It’s also worth noting that Russia was informed well ahead of the counter-attack. Israel considers the matter closed at this time but said it would retaliate heavily if attacked again. Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the IDF targeted “nearly all the Iranian infrastructure in Syria” and that Iran “needs to remember the saying that if it rains on us, it’ll storm on them. I hope we’ve finished this episode and everyone understood.” He continued, stating that Israel “won’t let anyone attack us or build an infrastructure to attack us in the future.” The extent of the damage done to Iranian interests in Syria still hasn’t been quantified, but Israel’s overwhelming response was clearly designed to deter further Iranian military operations against Israel. The big question now is how, or if Iran will respond to the onslaught? At the time of publishing, it is 10:30pm local time in Israel. If an Iranian reprisal strike does occur, it is likely to happen in the coming hours. Merkel Makes A Big Statement: German Chancellor Angela Merkel made quite the splash today when she announced that “It is no longer such that the United States simply protects us, but Europe must take its destiny in its own hands. That’s the task of the future.” Clearly, this is in reference to the changing foreign policy of the Trump administration and its ‘America First’ strategy. The President has also demanded that many NATO countries spend more on defense—much more—than they currently are. But Merkel’s declaration seems alarmingly disconnected to the very poor state of readiness that the German military is experiencing. It’s air force and navy are largely broken, while at the same time it looks to spend countless funds on indigenous weapons programs that will come too little, too late, if at all. Tactical Nuke Plan Under Fire: The Pentagon’s Nuclear Posture Review recommended developing new tactical nuclear weapons to better confront Russia’s own focus on using tactical nukes as a strategic fulcrum. This was and remains a highly controversial move that some see as totally wasteful and/or downright dangerous. During a House Armed Services Committee meeting on Wednesday, members stated their concerns about the initiative and tried to add amendments to limit the development of these new weapons, with Defense News stating : Democrats argued the U.S. development of a low-yield weapon ― likely a submarine-launched cruise missile ― will be destabilizing, fuel an international arms race and lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. “We have to have a credible deterrence, but I think the Nuclear Posture Review goes way beyond credible nuclear deterrence and puts you into a position where we risk miscalculation and we could stumble into a nuclear war,” said HASC Ranking Member Adam Smith, D-Wash. “We are on the track toward a new nuclear arms race, this time including Russia and China, the United States and perhaps other countries along the way. It’s extraordinarily dangerous, and we need to be very cautious here,” said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif. Republicans sided with the Pentagon , countering that the nation needs a robust nuclear program to pose a credible deterrent and keep pace with Russia and China, who they say are rapidly modernizing their nuclear arsenals. “This committee knows what Russia’s up to with its nuclear weapons. It’s both sobering and horrifying,” said HASC Strategic Forces Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala. “We also know Russia’s nuclear doctrine is to use low-yield nuclear weapons early in a conflict to get the U.S. to back down.” Mattis was also on The Hill this week defending the move to field new tactical nuclear weapons, saying that having them may help keep Russia from using similar weapons as a way to ‘escalate to deescalate.’ We have discussed this tactic before which you can read about here , here , and here . In the end, the Republican majority on the committee voted down the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act and endorsed the Nuclear Posture Review. We have stated our take on the document and the policy that is emanating from it. J-20 Heads To Sea And Shows Off Its Helmet Mounted Display: China’s now operational 5th generation fighter, the J-20 , has begun training over the ocean , a place it is most likely to see combat . A video of the jet undergoing training has surfaced, showing it flying with other Chinese fighters. In it, the pilot is wearing helmet-mounted display (HMD) that looks awfully similar to the Helmet Mounted Symbology System and its Cobra HMD derivative used on the Eurofighter Typhoon and the SAAB JAS39 Gripen. An HMD has long been expected to be a major component of the J-20s advanced avionics suite but one has not materialized until now. BAE System describes the utility of the dimples on the helmet as such: “The bumps (infra-red LED’s) are used to calculate the pilot’s head position and its angle. The LEDs on the helmet flash and the 3 sensors in the cockpit detect the flashing. The data is then used to calculate where the pilot is looking. As the pilot turns his head, the system continually re-configures to use the best sensor and LED combination to give the most accurate result. Accurate targeting is immediate; there’s no delay” Other HMDs, like the USAF’s JHMCS , don’t have the dimples because they use magnetic tracking instead. It’s worth noting that even well over a decade after entering into service, the F-22 still lacks any kind of an HMD. Modern HMDs allow pilots to target their weapons far off the centerline axis of the aircraft and drastically enhance situational awareness. Trump Touts Taking Enemy Prisoners And Freeing U.S. Prisoners: President Trump and the First Lady were on hand at Andrews AFB late last night for the homecoming of three U.S. prisoners that were being held in North Korea. Whatever your politics are, this is a great thing and a win. North Korean prisons and labor camps are hell on earth, and seeing these guys back on U.S. soil has to make you happy. There have been lots of commentaries stating that last night’s homecoming was in poor taste and that these men were being used as political props. The main thing is that they are home and really that’s all that matters. Kudos to Trump, Pompeo and the U.S. diplomatic team for making it happen. It’s also worth noting that the men flew on a separate aircraft, a C-40, while Pompeo flew on a C-32A. It isn’t clear why this occurred as both aircraft seemed to arrive nearly at the same time at Andrews AFB. Just hours after the three Americans returned home, Trump tweeted about capturing five of the most wanted ISIS leaders. The New York Times writes : “Five senior Islamic State officials have been captured, including a top aide to the group’s leader, in a complex cross-border sting carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence, two Iraqi officials said Wednesday. The three-month operation, which tracked a group of senior Islamic State leaders who had been hiding in Syria and Turkey, represents a significant intelligence victory for the American-led coalition fighting the extremist group and underscores the strengthening relationship between Washington and Baghdad. Two Iraqi intelligence officials said those captured included four Iraqis and one Syrian whose responsibilities included governing the Islamic State’s territory around Deir al-Zour, Syria, directing internal security and running the administrative body that oversees religious rulings. Iraq’s external intelligence agency published a statement confirming the arrests, but did not mention any details of the role played by the Americans or the Turks. The two Iraqi intelligence officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that had not been made public.” One of the men was a close aid to the Islamic State’s still unaccounted for kingpin Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi: “Mr. Ithawi, described by the Iraqis as a top aide to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, had been in charge of fatwas, or religious rulings, in the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate. He was also in charge of the education curriculum, and was a member of the body that appointed security and administrative leaders for the Islamic State’s territory, which had included large parts of Iraq and Syria. He had been living in Turkey with his Syrian wife under his brother’s identity, one of these officials said.” Capturing these maniacs alive could result in one of the biggest intelligence coups since the Islamic State thundered onto the world stage the better part of a decade ago. It could even lead to the capture or killing of al Baghdadi. Such an event would strike at the soul of the terror group that is already on the ropes in Syria and almost entirely exterminated from Iraq. America’s Troubled New Carrier Breaks Down: USS Gerald R. Ford experienced a catastrophic propulsion failure recently when a main thrust bearing failed. Maritime-Executive writes : This is the second time that the Ford has experienced the failure of a main thrust bearing on its propulsion system, following an earlier incident in April 2017. The bearings, manufactured by General Electric under its contract for the Ford’s propulsion system, were apparently made with “machining errors,” the root cause of the failures. The failure resulted in the $13B supercarrier returning to port for repairs. The Ford is riddled with issues which we have detailed many times before , and its ability to carry out its mission by its in-service date, which is now sometime in 2022, remains uncertain. Meanwhile its sister ship the USS John F. Kennedy is 75 percent structurally complete . And whatever issues the Ford suffers from the Kennedy will too.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2019",Special Operators Getting A New Round For Their Precision Rifles And An ‘Assault’ Machine Gun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. Special Operations Command has revealed plans to replace a number of precision rifles across its components that use NATO-standard 7.62mm ammunition with new guns chambered for a smaller cartridge, the 6.5mm Creedmoor. It has also disclosed that it is developing a new “assault” machine gun that fires the same round, which is part of broader efforts to provide longer range, but still relatively lightweight fire support weapons . U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Mark Owens, who is presently the Program Manager for Ammo, Weapons and Visual Augmentation Systems at Special Operations Command, gave the new details during an unclassified briefing at the National Defense Industry Association’s annual Armaments Conference earlier in May 2018. That special operations forces were considering the 6.5mm cartridge for precision weapons first emerged in 2017 , but Soldier Systems Daily was first to report that this effort now includes a light machine gun, as well. According to Owens’ presentation, in testing in 2017, special operators shooting rifles modified to fire 6.5mm Creedmoor were twice as likely to hit their targets compared those using control guns in the existing 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. Special Operations Command also evaluated .260 Remington and collected data on the performance of all three types of ammunition in the FN Mk 20 Mod 0 Sniper Support Rifle, the Knight’s Armament Company M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS), and Heckler and Koch M110A1 Compact Semi-Automatic Sniper System (CSASS). The testing also showed that the 6.5mm versions of the weapons have 40 percent greater range and less recoil than their 7.62mm counterparts. The round was 30 percent less susceptible to wind drift, as well, making it more precise at those distances. Heckler and Koch’s M110A1 CSASS., Joseph Trevithick This matches up with preliminary information in a report from Military Times in April 2017. Both the 6.5mm Creedmoor and .260 Remington “stay supersonic longer, have less wind drift and better terminal performance than 7.62 mm ammunition,” unnamed Special Operations Command officials said at the time. These performance characteristics mean that weapons such as the Mk 20 Mod 0, M110, and M110A1 are now adequately able to fill the “range gap” between standard individual rifles and precision, long-range sniper rifles. Owens’ brief included a chart showing that there had previously been a more than 650-foot gap between the maximum effective range of those weapons and the minimum distance at which snipers typically operate. One of U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Mark Owens’ briefing slide detailing the effort that led to the selection of the 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge., SOCOM via Soldier Systems Daily Since both 6.5mm Creedmoor and .260 Remington use modified 7.62x51mm cartridge cases, converting a weapon from one to the other is typically as easy as changing the barrel. AR-10-pattern rifles and derivatives are available on the commercial market in the United States in both calibers. The M110 and M110A1 are both derived from this platform. The Heckler and Koch gun’s main difference is that it uses a physical piston to cycle the action rather than siphoning propellant gas from the barrel and using that to directly push the internal components. It is not clear whether or not Special Operations Command plans to use the shift in ammunition type as an opportunity to consolidate the total number of applicable weapons in use across its components. Owens’ presentation used the M110A1 CSASS as a standard-in for the future 6.5mm Creedmoor rifles, but there was no indication that this would be the universal platform. Special operators are set to begin receiving the new weapons in 2019. At the same time, though, Owens unveiled a heretofore unknown plan to also develop a light machine gun, referred to as an “assualt machine gun,” also using the 6.5mm cartridge. This immediately makes sense from a logistical standpoint, since weapons in this category, such as the FN M240L and Mk 48 Mod 1 machine guns, presently fire the 7.62x51mm round. Another one of Owens’ briefing slides showing a basic timeline for development and fielding of the 6.5mm “assault” machine gun., SOCOM via Soldier Systems Daily Without the added commonality, units might find themselves having to carry an additional type of ammunition, which could be burdensome and prevent personnel from sharing resources in an emergency. Of course, it is unlikely that the machine gun would use the exact same type of 6.5mm ammunition as the rifles. Traditionally, the U.S. military has developed more precise rounds specifically for these types of marksman and precision rifles. A machine gun in 6.5mm Creedmoor would almost certainly gain some of the range and accuracy benefits as the rifles, but in a package that should not be any heavier than the existing 7.62x51mm weapons. The Mk 48 Mod 1 is already nearly 10 pounds lighter than the standard M240B infantry light machine gun, making it far more handy and portable. A regular US Army soldier fires a Mk 48 light machine gun., US Army The reduced recoil from the 6.5mm Creedmoor might be a boon, as well. In order to make the Mk 48s as light as possible, these guns had a tendency to lose accuracy due to how much the weapon would shake during sustained firing. There were also problems with overheating and the gas system filling quickly with carbon, the latter issue leading to jamming unless operators thoroughly cleaned the weapon regularly. The Mod 1 upgrade package was supposed to mitigate many of these issues already, but the new ammunition might even further improve the situation with minimal effort. It’s not the first time the U.S. military has considered doing this, either. In the late 1970s, the U.S. Army looked into adopting a light machine gun in a 6x45mm universal cartridge that would replace both certain 5.56x45mm rifles and 7.62x51mm light machine guns. Concerned with the logistical issues of adding a new cartridge, among others, the service eventually ditched that plan and adopted the 5.56mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon instead. It is possible that Special Operations Command’s new development might revive those older concepts across the U.S. military. The Army is already in the process of ironing out requirements for a new squad automatic weapon and is also investigating adopting new ammunition to go with it. There would be a recent precedent for this type of cooperation. Special Operations Command and the U.S. Marine Corps continue to work together on a larger, lighter-weight medium machine gun firing the powerful .338 Norma Magnum cartridge. General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems’ .338 Norma Magnum Lightweight Medium Machine Gun, which Special Operations Command the US Marine Corps are now evaluating., Joseph Trevithick This weapon, which you can read about in more detail here , offers range closer to the .50 M2 caliber heavy machine gun, but in a package that is significantly more man-portable than those weapons. At more than 80-pounds, the standard M2 is largely restricted to vehicle-mounted applications. The .338 round is nowhere near as powerful, though, making it a supplemental weapon rather than a replacement for the larger guns. The 6.5mm machine guns would similarly be complimentary with these other weapons. As with the new precision rifles chambered in this ammunition, they will better fill any potential range gaps between 7.62mm support weapons and larger guns. All told, it looks as if special operators are set to gain important capabilities that will allow small units to effectively engage targets, and do so precisely, at far greater ranges than before. The ease in converting existing 7.62mm weapons to the new ammunition might make this an attractive upgrade option across the services in the near future, as well.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 25, 2018",Rockets Fly Over The Golan Heights As A Larger Conflict Between Israel and Iran Looms (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still emerging, but Israel says that areas of the Golan Heights that it occupies have come under attack directly from Iran’s Quds Force in neighboring Syria and that it retaliated, possibly by striking targets in the Syrian capital Damascus. The incident reflects the latest in a series of increasingly serious exchanges between the two countries in the region and comes amid increased tensions following the United States’ decision to withdraw from a controversial deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program. In the early hours local time in Israel on May 10, 2018, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that at least 20 unspecified rockets had landed in the Golan, but caused no injuries. Alert sirens reportedly went off in the Israeli communities of Majdal Shams, Neve Ativ, Nimrod, Masa’ade, Buqa’ata, Odem, and El Rom and Iron Dome systems fired an unknown number of interceptors and shot down at least some of the incoming projectiles. The attacks immediately followed reported Israeli artillery strikes on forces aligned with Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad, possibly Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers, in the Syrian city of Baath in the Quneitra Governorate. “The IDF sees this Iranian attack on Israel with severity,”  IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus told The Times of Israel shortly after midnight on May 10, 2018. “This event is not over,” he stressed at the time. “This was an Iranian event was a significant event and it will not be tolerated,” IDF Spokesman Brigadier General Ronen Manelis said, according to The Jerusalem Post . He made it clear there would be an Israeli response. This response subsequently came in the form of additional Israeli stand-off strikes on targets in and around Damascus. After the already rare decision to name Iran as being behind the attacks in the Golan, Israel then publicly acknowledged it was striking Iranian targets inside Syria. Even more unprecedented, the IDF said Assad and his forces should not try to interfere with the retaliatory strikes or face an equally severe response. There were reports that Syrian Air Defenses had attempted to shoot down some of the incoming Israeli missiles. Even before the skirmish in the Golan touched off the flurry of activity, Israel had already put the IDF on heightened alert after US President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration would abandon the Iran Deal on April 8th, 2018.  This reportedly included the call-up of certain reserve air defense and intelligence the day before. At the same time, there had been reports that additional forces were moving toward the Golan in response to “suspicious activity” on the Syrian side of the border. The IDF told local authorities to open community bomb shelters as a precaution. Though the immediate inciting incident does appear to be the Israeli strike on the targets in Baath, that is just the most recent in series of strikes by Israel against Iran and its interests in Syria, including proxy forces, such as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah . On May 9, 2018, the Assad regime also blamed Israel for a separate operation that targeted an Iranian-controlled weapons depot within a Syrian military base in Kiswah, just south of the capital Damascus. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an independent U.K.-based monitoring group, those strikes killed at least eight members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and another 15 pro-regime militiamen, including other third-party nationals. Many reports treat the IRGC and the Quds Force interchangeably, though the latter is an entity within the former organization primarily tasked with external operations. The powerful quasi-military IRGC is distinct from the country’s military and officially exists to guard Iran’s supreme leader, presently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, his overarching authority, and the Islamic Republic of Iran’s underlying theocratic system of government. As of October 2017, the U.S. government had designated both the Quds Force specifically and the IRGC as a whole as terrorist groups for their direct connection to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine, as well as their direct support for Houthi rebels in Yemen . Since the beginning of 2018 alone, there have been more than a half a dozen major Israeli strikes on Syrian targets or reported incidents involving the country’s forces operating in Syria. This tempo has steadily increased since April 2018 and shows no signs of changing any time soon. But directly accusing the Quds Force of strikes into Israel represents a new and significant escalation in what had already been a low-level conflict between Iran and Israel in the region. In February 2018, Iranian forces in Syria launched a drone into Israeli territory, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials later said had been armed and on a strike mission of its own. That incident touched off a burst of counter-strikes that left one Israeli Air Force F-16I multi-role combat aircraft destroyed and one of its F-15s damaged. There are also reports that the “rockets” that flew across the border from Syria were actually short-range ballistic missiles, which would also mark a major change in the nature of the fighting. In June 2017, Iran launched an unprecedented strike on ISIS terrorists using that class of weapon , Zulfiqar missiles specifically in that case, which we noted at the time could have also been a demonstration for the benefit of Israel and other potential opponents of its capabilities. At the very beginning of May 2018, Iranian Defense Minister Amir Khatami had called on Israel to stop its “provocative actions” against the Islamic Republic. That followed Netanyahu’s elaborate show-and-tell presentation in which he accused Iran of lying about its nuclear ambitions. “This is our warning to the regime occupying Jerusalem and its supporters – stop your dangerous behavior,” Khatami said. “The Iranian response will be  surprising and you will regret it.” Despite these and other threats, we are certain to see a stronger Israeli retaliation over Iran’s attacks in the near future, as well as a continuation of Israel’s broader campaign against Iran’s interests in Syria. However, these actions appear to now be prompting increasingly threatening Iranian responses. With all this in mind, what we’re seeing now seems to be the closest the two countries have come to entering into an all-out war. We will continue to update this post as new information becomes available. Update: 6:20pm PST— Clearly a major Israel response has been underway for some time now. Multiple waves of aerial attacks, most likely by standoff missiles, have been underway. Of course, Syrian government sources say most have been shot down by their air defense systems. Regardless, it looks like a wide variety of targets are being struck in multiple geographical areas. We may have to wait some time to get a better idea of just how extensive the target list was. There are also reports of Russian fighters getting airborne to defend Damascus. These rumors seem to be par for the course now when Israel strikes, and it’s unlikely that Russia will intervene. Netanyahu was in Moscow today with Putin for Russia’s Victory Day Parade, clearly, the situation was discussed at that time. AP Update: 6:40pm PST— Looks like things are quieting down as dawn is approaching. These exchanges could become a very common occurrence in the coming hours and days though, with the big question being will it develop into a full-on sustained campaign/war? Updated: 7pm PST— Multiple outlets are reporting that the IAF hit Iranian related targets all over Syria in a massive counter-attack. At least one Syrian air defense site was also supposedly hit . The Times Of Israel states “the late-night Iranian rocket barrage and Israeli counterattack appeared to be the largest exchange in Syria since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.” We still don’t know the type of rockets fired into Israel. Some have said at least a few of the 20 projectiles were short-range ballistic missiles. There was ‘limited’ damage to Israeli bases as a result of the barrage which lends credence to the possibility that they were more advanced guided missiles than the basic ballistic artillery rockets traditionally used by groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel and the U.S. have noted that Iran had been moving more advanced missile systems into Syria in as of late and the IAF had gone after those weapons on numerous occasions in recent weeks. Update: 8:45pms PST— The IDF has released an update on the operation, stating: “The IDF is attacking dozens of military targets that belong to the Iranian Quds Force in the Syrian territory. In the framework of the extensive attack, Iranian intelligence sites operated by Quds Force were attacked: Logistic headquarters of the Quds Force. Military complex and the Quds Force logistics complex in Chisoua. An Iranian military camp north of Damascus. The weapon storage sites of Quds Force at the Damascus International Airport. Systems and Otsevi of intelligence associated with the Quds Force. Observation, military positions and weapons in the area of the barrier. The Iranian launcher was also destroyed from which the missiles were launched into Israel tonight. The IAF was attacked by Syrian aerial defense batteries, which carried out firing at the Israeli warning. In response, the IDF has attacked several aerial intercept systems (SA-5, SA-2, SA-22, SA-17) belonging to the Syrian Army.  Each Tosino to their base in peace.” They also included this short video showing the MLRS launcher and where to traveled before being destroyed: The inclusion of targeting multiple air defense sites could be the first sign that Israel is looking to establish a more robust long-term air campaign of sorts over Syrian territory. Dismantling key elements of Assad’s air defense network will allow IAF fighters to move to making more high-volume direct attacks once again on Iranian-related sites in Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on May 21, 2018",Here’s What You Need To Know About What Trump Just Did To The Iran Nuclear Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. U.S. President Donald Trump has, after months of threatening to do so, signed a memorandum instructing the U.S. government to begin pulling out of the controversial deal over Iran’s nuclear programs. His administration has outlined a number of steps it plans to take in the next six months, but it is still not entirely clear when certain provisions will end and what impacts that may have in the near- and long-term with regards to Iran or other international engagements, such as America’s ongoing negotiations with North Korea . Trump made the announcement from the White House on May 8, 2018. As a presidential candidate, president-elect, and then president, he has continually railed against the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA , pledging to either negotiate a new one, or, failing to do that, withdraw from the agreement entirely. The biggest issue, as we at The War Zone have noted before , is that the JCPOA focuses on Iran’s nuclear activities to the exclusion of everything else. Iran is, by the U.S. government’s own admission, abiding by the letter of the deal. At the same time, however, the United States, as well as Israel, accuse Iranian authorities of violating the spirit of the agreement by not using relief from international sanctions and other tangible benefits to pursue stabilizing policies in the Middle East and elsewhere.Â Trump outlined this basic argument in his remarks on May 8, 2018: “In theory, the so-called ‘Iran deal’ was supposed to protect the  United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.  In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout. The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regimeâ€™s nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.” Many have argued that the JCPOA is therefore inherently unworkable and that the U.S. government should discard it, which the Trump Administration has now chosen to do. At the same time, many criticisms of the deal are based on either honest or deliberate misunderstandings of its mechanisms, which appears to have informed Trump’s final decision at least to some degree. So, here’s a quick overview of what Trump said and did not say: Instead of using sanctions relief as a springboard to pursuing stabilizing policies, Iran has to continued to develop increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles , sponsoring terrorists and other militant groups in countries such as Syria and Yemen , committing gross human rights violations against its own people, and calling for the destruction of Israel , which are all true. Iran negotiated in bad faith from the beginning since it had previously concealed a nuclear weapons program from the international community despite denying it had ever done so, which is at best partly true. Though Iran did have a covert nuclear weapons program, recent Israeli intelligence , which Trump cited, seems to support the conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence Community and the United Nation’s International Atomic Energy Agency that this work had effectively ceased by 2009, years before the JCPOA came into effect. Trump claimed Iran has an active nuclear weapons program in his remarks, despite there being no indication that this is the case. Trump said that Iran can continue enriching uranium under the terms of the JCPOA, but did not note that it can only do so to a very low level, far less than what is necessary to produce a nuclear weapon. He also did not note that under the terms of the JCPOA, Iran agreed to physically give up its existing stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and put the facilities where it could do so in the future under strict international supervision. Trump noted that Iran retains the knowledgebase and basic infrastructure necessary for a “nuclear breakout” to produce nuclear weapons in the future, which is true. Of course, Iran will retain those capabilities no matter what and it is difficult to understand how it would be possible to eliminate them entirely, especially when it comes to the specialized technical skills of individuals involved in the previous programs. Trump raised the issue that the JCPOA has not prevented the continued development of ballistic missiles that could carry either conventional or nuclear weapons, which is another matter of legitimate concern. Separate United Nations Security Council Resolutions do prohibit Iran from pursuing nuclear weapon delivery systems, but since it says it is not developing a nuclear weapon, it asserts that its missile programs are exempt. The United States has long disagreed , saying that many of these weapon systems, especially intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles, are inherently strategic and have no military utility without a nuclear warhead. Trump accused Iran of potentially hiding continued nuclear work in dual-purpose military facilities, which is a significant and legitimate concern. Though he did not name it specifically, one base, at Parchin, has been at the center of a significant debate between the United States and Iran about what the JCPOA does and doesn’t cover.Â International inspectors are supposed to be able to access sites such as Parchin if they can provide strong evidence of a violation, but the IAEA says that the United States has refused to provide sufficient information to substantiate its claims. “Sunset provisions are totally unacceptable,” Trump said, which refers to various scheduled decisions and is only a partly accurate description of the agreement. In 2023, the then President of the United States will have to ask Congress for approval to eliminate sanctions against Iran’s nuclear enterprises, which remain in force under the JCPOA. In 2026, absent any negotiated agreement to extend the provisions, Iran could begin enriching and reprocessing fissile material without restrictions. What Trump didn’t say was that neither of these “sunsets” is automatic when it comes to sanctions for the United States, which has already reserved the right to maintain the nuclear sanctions if it does not feel it is appropriate to eliminate them. In addition, as with most arms control agreements, expirations of certain provisions are usually dealt with by either extending the deal or negotiating a new one based on circumstances at the time.Â Though perhaps not the best example now, the United States and Russia signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in 2010 as a follow-on to previous agreements. That deal could also “sunset” in 2021, which would remove agreed-upon restrictions on both countries’ nuclear arsenals and is supposed to serve as the impetus to negotiate an extension or a new deal. Regardless, this is what his administration now plans to do: “We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanctions. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States,” Trump said. According to the Department of Treasury , there are scheduled plans for economic and other restrictions to “snap back” within 90- and 180-days. After 90-days, the U.S. government will reimpose sanctions related to Iran’s currency, precious metals, aluminum and steel, coal, and automotive sectors. Sanctions relating to the purchase or other transactions dealing with Iran’s sovereign debt will also return. In addition, the United States will once again ban on Iranian carpets and certain foodstuffs, as well as limitations on certain financial transactions. After 180-days, the U.S. government will restore sanctions against Iran’s shipping and shipbuilding, oil and petrochemical, civil energy, and banking sectors. The U.S. government will also reimpose limits on various activities by Iranian nationals in the United States, as well as blocking the entry and activities of certain individuals and entities entirely. It is worth noting that in October 2017, the United States already designated Iranâ€™s powerful quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and imposed a host of new sanctions on it, industrial and business entities connected to it, and its personnel. “If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before,” Trump also said during his speech. This appeared to be a threat to potentially use of military force, but he offered no additional details. “We will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat,” added. “This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iranâ€™s ballistic missile program; to stop its terrorist activities worldwide; and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East,” he explained, but gave no more concrete details on the U.S. government’s specific policy objectives. It is without a doubt worth considering whether Iran should be penalized for continuing the various aforementioned malign activities. It’s also worth asking whether or not the Iran Deal, which was serving its stated purpose, was worth getting rid of entirely in pursuit of that goal. “The fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people,” Trump declared in his remarks, which you can watch in full below. “When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.” However, the Iran deal is a multi-national affair and the other parties, Iran, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have already made it clear they intend to continue within the JCPOA framework for the foreseeable future. The trilateral statement from the U.K., French, and German governments perhaps represent the greatest immediate challenge for the United States, given that Trump pointedly threatened anyone who continued to deal with Iran with additional sanctions.Â JUST IN: May, Merkel and Macron release joint statement expressing ""regret"" at Pres. Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw U.S. from Iran nuclear deal. Together, we emphasise our continuing commitment to the JCPoA. This agreement remains important for our shared security."" pic.twitter.com/caixgLkYca — Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) May 8, 2018 Russia and China have both reiterated their support for the deal, as well. The Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a long time critic of the deal, has openly embraced Trump’s decision. Iran already appears willing to try and use the Trump Administration’s decision to drive a wedge between it and some of its oldest allies, saying that it will continue to work with the remaining parties to continue with the JCPOA. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani did say he was ordering the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to begin preparations for restarting enrichment and processing work if the deal completely collapses. Rouhani: ""We will wait a few weeks before taking this action, and will negotiate with our friends and allies and with the parties who signed the JCPAO. If our interests secured under JCPOA, we will continue, and if deal is just paper, our next path will be clear."" — Borzou Daragahi ðŸ–ŠðŸ—’ (@borzou) May 8, 2018 “This is a psychological war, we wonâ€™t allow Trump to win… Iâ€™m happy that the pesky being has left the Barjam,” Rouhani said in his own statement after Trump’s announcement, using the Farsi acronym for the JCPOA. “Tonight we witnessed a new historic experience… for 40 years weâ€™ve said and repeated that Iran always abides by its commitments, and the US never complies, our 40-year history shows us Americans have been aggressive towards great people of Iran and our region.” Trump’s decision also comes literally right before newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was set to meet with North Korean representatives in that country to iron out the final details about a historic meeting between the American president and premier Kim Jong Un at a still undisclosed location. A central goal of those discussions will be the elimination of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles, which will already be a tall order . The United States has also been looking to immediately secure the release of three Americans that North Korea is holding hostage.Â It’s not clear how the Trump Administration’s decision vis-a-vis Iran might impact the geopolitical situation in the Middle East or elsewhere more broadly, but we might not have to wait long to see the second- and third-order effects. We will have an additional report on the many interconnected issues at play coming soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 30, 2018",Tearing Up The Iran Nuclear Deal While Negotiating With N. Korea Is Far From ‘The Art Of The Deal’,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For a president who claims to be the world’s greatest of deal-maker and even has a best-selling book named Art of The Deal , yesterday’s move to unilaterally rip-up the Iranian nuclear deal just as the administration is entering into high-stakes negotiations with North Korea on their nuclear program is the height of stupidity. It drastically weakens America’s hand at the negotiating table with Pyongyang, and above all else, it shows that passion and long-standing grudges supersede logic and responsible foreign policy decision making within the executive branch’s newly remodeled foreign policy apparatus. I really want someone to explain to me how doing this now isn’t bafflingly irresponsible. In fact, let’s put all opinions on the Iranian nuclear deal aside. Let’s say you believe that the U.S. should pull out of the deal. Fine. But how does doing it right now, weeks away from the Kim-Trump summit, make any sense at all and can’t be deemed overtly reckless? Why not just do it in six months from now, after a North Korean deal is signed, should one come to pass at all. How can the Trump administration really expect the Kim regime to hand over its only major bargaining chip and insurance policy as to its survival, one that it has spent tremendous resources on and has taken years to develop, based on promises made by the United States? It’s bad enough that the Kim regime is highly cognizant of what happened to Libyan strongman Muammar Gadaffi after he played ball with the United States and ended his nuclear weapons program, one which was far less mature than North Korea’s. Now it has been brilliantly showcased that a deal inked by the U.S., backed by the international community no less, and one that Iran has abided by even by the Pentagon’s top civilian and uniformed officials own evaluations, can be torn up on a whim by this presidency or the next. This reality is especially problematic for the side giving up major capabilities as once the weapons, their manufacturing and support infrastructure, the delivery systems they are to be mated with, and other elements of a nuclear weapons program are gone, bringing them back becomes a very expensive and time-consuming task. North Korea in particular, which the White House is demanding immediately denuclearize, will now have to make a decision to do so knowing full well that even after they have complied, the benefits of doing so can evaporate in an instant. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if that means they get all their capabilities back immediately, but that isn’t how it works. North Korea can and likely will use the White House’s decision to rip-up the Iran nuclear deal as a reason to stand firm on certain aspects of a proposed denuclearization agreement during negotiations. They can also use it to play to the international community, referencing it as an example of how Washington is prodding them to do something totally illogical and even suicidal. They can then underline how a much slower denuclearization process—one that may not include giving up their current arsenal for years or even decades, if ever, is the only acceptable compromise. In addition, if the U.S. walks away from the table because Pyongyang is unwilling to simply hand over their prized weapons immediately in what would already be a phenomenal capitulatory act, North Korea will simply say doing so results in no actual guarantee that the terms agreed upon will remain in play as promised. The international community, especially Russia and China who are closely involved with North Korea, are now unlikely to disagree with such a conclusion. So once again, even if you think the Iran nuclear deal should be torn up, why do it at this incredibly strategic moment, a time in which we are dealing with disarming another rogue regime that actually has verified nuclear capabilities and the delivery systems that could potentially convey warheads over long ranges? There has been zero hard intelligence presented that points to Iran reconstituting its nuclear program, and even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grandiose presentation on ‘new information’ regarding Iran’s nuclear program featured no such smoking gun. In fact, it was a seemingly desperate act to package old information into some sort vague case to end the nuclear agreement and deal with Iran in other ways, with military action always seeming the underlying preferred option. It basically said that Iran has lied in the past about its nuclear program, which is not news. And if the fact that Iran fibs about its military capabilities is a reason for war, how many times would there have been unchecked combat over the Persian Gulf over the last four decades? Even America’s credibility when it comes to applying military pressure on North Korea is damaged by pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal. It’s likely that tensions are going to rapidly rise in the Middle East after this decision, and countering that is going to take more of the Pentagon’s focus and warfighting capacity. An actual war with Iran is a whole other story. Newly minted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lands in Pyongyang today for his second trip to North Korea. Three U.S. prisoners held by North Korea were handed over as a goodwill gesture, but remember, Kim’s top priority is just getting to the table and being seen as an equal with the leader of the free world, not necessarily what comes from that meeting. The regime has shown no real signs that it is willing to fork over its nuclear weapons anytime soon. So getting the prisoners handed over is a great thing and should be commended, but it is not a sign that North Korea plans on capitulating to the United States as it is being asked., MATTHEW LEE/AFP/Getty Images North Korea knows full well that drastically heightened tensions with Iran mean that the U.S. can’t pressure it like it had previously when it comes to raw military might. And the prospect of fighting two potentially very bloody and open-ended wars in two drastically disparate theaters is something the U.S. will struggle with confronting, and especially in terms of sustaining those operations over the long haul. In addition, either war would result in a massive destabilization in the world markets, and one with Iran, in which a quarter of the world’s oil supply could be cut off overnight , would be absolutely devastating financially. That’s not to mention that an Iranian conflict would also include a war on Israel’s own borders via Tehran’s proxies, and it even puts the Mandeb Strait and shipping through the Red Sea at risk. Since day one of this administration, Iran has been in its crosshairs. Disgraced general and short-term National Security Advisor Mark Flynn had his little impromptu statement in the White House briefing room shortly after coming into office. Fast forward to today and the Iran hawk dream team now fills out Trump’s national security and diplomatic cadre, with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and John Bolton as National Security Advisor. With this crew in place, it’s unsurprising that Trump’s weariness of the Iranian nuke deal has turned into outright contempt for it. But what’s most telling is how little thought has gone into what comes next. I implore you to read in full the transcript of this off-camera Q&A between a senior State Department official and reporters. Deeming it alarming is an understatement. Even as Trump proclaimed in his canned statement that he has consulted his European allies before making this decision, none of them agree with it. In fact, it’s quite the opposite, they warn of how terrible a move this is and are not willing to break the deal on their end. This sets up a crazy situation where the U.S. may end up sanctioning European businesses for doing deals in Iran that occurred in compliance with an agreement the U.S. spearheaded just a few years ago. Russia and China also fully support the deal and could actively work with Tehran to thwart negative impacts from an onslaught of looming U.S. sanctions. Is Iran a bad actor in the Middle East? Absolutely, no news there. Has the magnitude of their reach increased since 2015? Yes, it has. But that ship has sailed. If the White House wants to deal with Iran’s extra-territorial activities or ballistic missile programs than it can make a case for doing so without ripping up the nuclear deal unilaterally and injecting massive quantities of uncertainty into a region that is already far from stable. Now that the U.S. has acted, if Iran moves to immediately reconstitute their nuclear program, other increasingly powerful players in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are sure to follow with their own spinning up their own nuclear programs. In fact, moving toward a mutually assured destruction model by acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities may be invited at this point as the word of the United States is now deeply in question even when it comes to its very own non-proliferation deals. In other words, for Saudi Arabia, which is also increasingly assertive in the region, just getting its own nukes and not having to depend on the U.S. to contain Iran is likely a welcome prospect at this point. Beyond how this decision impacts the North Korean nuclear weapons issue and the security situation in the Middle East in the longer-term, we now have to wait to see what shorter-term actions will occur as a result. Israel seems to be readying for a full-on conflict with Iran and their proxies in the region now. The Pentagon is also bracing for possible blowback against its forces based in the area, and especially in Syria and Iraq. So yeah, we get it, Iran is a bad actor who is increasingly pushing their interests abroad in many ways that are in direct conflict with U.S. interests. And Tehran would say the exact same about Washington. And yes, the Iranian nuclear deal is far from perfect and the Obama administration failed miserably when it came to limiting Iran’s ability to act nefariously in the region. But the agreement is working within its limited scope and Iran has abided by it as it said it would. It’s very unfortunate that Iran will go down in history as being more trustworthy than the United States when it came to such an important deal. This will damage U.S. credibility in other ways outside the North Korean negotiations as well. The cold hard truth is that Iran is far less of a threat to the United States than North Korea, especially considering its current largely dormant nuclear status. And what’s most important is that the single element that is needed in order to have any possibility of reaching some sort of a deal with North Korea is trust that such an agreement will be executed as promised. Vice President Pence and NSA John Bolton watch on as President Trump announces that the U.S. is pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. This was likely a highlight of Bolton career as he has been the most vocal hawk when it comes to Iran over the last decade and a half. , AP Considering trust between Washington and Pyongyang is already a very scarce commodity, literally showing the North Koreans that America’s word means nothing and its willingness to stick to its agreements can drastically morph due to a change in direction of political winds gives the Kim regime every reason to give up far less than it would otherwise, and especially less than what the Trump administration is asking of them. In other words, if the idea of Kim just handing over his nuclear arsenal and destroying his nuclear and missile programs was far-fetched on May 7th, 2018, it is had turned into all but a wide-eyed fantasy following Trump’s announcement the next day.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 10, 2018",Russia’s Tiny Machine Gun-Toting Snowmobile Keeps Occupants Warm Even When It’s 50 Below,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Decades after the fall of the Soviet Union, the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow to honor the defeat of Nazi Germany during the Second World War continues to be a great opportunity to scope out Russia’s latest tanks , mobile ballistic missiles , combat aircraft and aerial weapons , and other large military hardware. Though it looks like it might be better suited to carrying the henchmen in an action movie than actual troops, a small armed snowmobile called the Berkut-2 and its heated cabin may be one of the most interesting participants this year, underscoring the country’s growing militarization of the Arctic Region . Russian firm NPO Transport builds the small vehicles, which are essentially small car body fitted on top of a snowmobile chassis, in the city of Nizhny Novgorod in Western Russia. The Berkut-2, also known as the TTM-1901-40, the particular variant that took part in the parade, is a refined, militarized version of the original Berkut TTM-1901. NPO, which also makes a variety of heavier snow-capable vehicles for industrial purposes, such as oil and gas field work, had initially promoted the Berkut mainly on the civilian market. In 2015 , the company said it had a contract with the country’s Defense Ministry and the following year it delivered the first batch of 40 Berkut-2 vehicles, which only require a single driver and have an additional seat for a second individual inside the enclosed cabin. Berkut-2 being paraded through Moscow during Victory Day 2018 review., Vitaly Kuzmin “The regional authorities [in Russia’s Arctic areas] have helped us to develop and make the advanced vehicle,” NPO Transport Director General Nikolai Veselov said in October 2016. “This year, we have been granted a subsidy as a compensation of part of our investment in the development of the production facilities – 3.3 million rubles,” which was equal to approximately $53,000 at that time, he added. The first iteration of the TTM-1901 Berkut., NPO Transport The Berkut and Berkut-2 are both relatively simple vehicles. The original design used body components from old Soviet-era VAZ-1111 Oka compact cars. The Oka subsequently became a Lada -branded product before production ended in 2008. The Berkut-2 features a much more streamlined looking body that does not appear to have any relation to the Oka. Both the original and the improved design use the same VAZ-21213 80-horsepower engine, which is also found on some models of the popular Lada Niva jeep. The engine compartment of a Berkut., NPO Transport Underneath is a traditional snowmobile design, with a pair of articulating skis up front to steer and tracks at the rear to drive the vehicle. NPO says it can hit a top speed of nearly 40 miles per hour, but it’s not clear what sort of surface conditions it requires to achieve that performance. The Berkuts can travel an average of 125 miles on a single tank of gas, according to the firm. It’s also small enough to fit on the back of relatively small trucks for more rapid transport to and from snow-covered areas of operation. During the Victory Day parade, civilian-style flatbed cargo trucks carried the snowmobiles. Many of Russia’s military transport aircraft, such as the Il-76 , could easily carry them internally and An-32 or An-76 tactical airlifters may be able to as well. Helicopters such as the Mi-8/17 could carry them sling-loaded or even possibly inside their cabin. This could also make the Berkuts an attractive way to provide additional mobility for airborne or special operations forces inserted in remote Arctic areas for short-duration missions. Russian units already train to conduct parachute jumps above the Arctic Circle . Vitaly Kuzmin The vehicles can also tow more than 650 pounds of weight, which could include cargo sleds. Russian Ministry of Defense videos show the vehicles pulling along troops on skis via a tether, as well. The militarized Berkut-2 also has an external mount for a single machine gun above the driver’s compartment, which would provide some limited local defense. From the examples at the Victory Day parade and those in other official video clips, the vehicle’s the primary mounted weapon appears to be the 7.62mm PKP Pecheneg , the latest iteration of the ubiquitous Soviet-era PK-series of light machine guns. It also has provisions for communications and satellite navigation systems. But the Berkut’s most significant feature seems to be its heating system. NPO claims that it can keep the occupants at a comfortable 64 degrees Fahrenheit even if the outside temperature dips to nearly negative 60 degrees. It is almost certainly a welcome change, at least for the drivers, who have otherwise employed more typical snowmobiles, which leave them exposed to the elements, or even dog and caribou-drawn sleighs to get around. The troops traveling in sleds behind or holding on while riding on their skis, or the gunner up above, still don’t get any respite from the weather. Russian troops ride in a sled behind a more typical snowmobile during an exercise., Russian MoD Caribou pull a sleigh with Russian troops., Russian MoD It also makes the Berkuts ideal for patrolling around and otherwise supporting operations in and around the increasingly strategic Arctic region. A significant portion of Northern Russia is already above the Arctic Circle . And since 2014 , under the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country’s military has been expanding its presence in the region, refurbishing old, abandoned sites and opening entirely new ones. In April 2017, Russian officials unveiled one of the first of these facilities, dubbed the Arctkicheski Trilistnik , translating variously as Arctic Trefoil or Arctic Shamrock. Mobile radar equipment sits in the foreground with the then-under-construction Artic Trefoil behind in 2015., Russian MoD This complex sits on Alexandra Land, an island in the Franz Josef archipelago, and is well north of the Arctic Circle in the Barents Sea. Cut off from the mainland for months at a time, it has various features, including its own powerplant, to remain self-sufficient in the dead of winter. Snowmobiles and other similar vehicles are essential for getting around in the otherwise largely inhospitable area. Russia’s Arctic troops have also been receiving specialized variants of air defense systems , helicopters , and other equipment handle the extreme weather. Air and naval activity , especially submarine patrols and other underwater developments , have also been particularly pronounced in the region.

It seems especially well suited to moving personnel and cargo between remote Arctic sites and otherwise monitoring those areas for intruders and other developments. And being simple and cheap to operate and maintain, the Berkuts are a good choice for operations in regions where it might be difficult to quickly get replacement parts and other outside support. As the Russian military continues to increase its activities in and around the Arctic region it seems safe to assume that we’ll be seeing more of the Berkuts beyond just parades and the occasional promotional video.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 15, 2018",China Teases Its H-20 Stealth Bomber and Trolls Northrop Grumman At The Same Time,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The state-run Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, may have given a first look at the long-rumored H-20 stealth bomber in a promotional video that apes Northrop Grummanâ€™s famous Superbowl ad teasing what is now known as the B-21 Raider . The clip, which highlights the consortiumâ€™s various civil and military products, as well as those from its subsidiaries, has a number of other significant nods to the countryâ€™s strategic aviation capabilities, past and present. China Defense Online posted a copy of the video , which combines file footage with slick computer-generated graphics, online on May 8, 2018. Though the presentation has AVIC branding only, it is specifically a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation , or XAC, which the Chinese government founded in 1958. XAC is reportedly responsible for the development of the H-20 and is also the primary firm behind the Y-20 airlifter , the countryâ€™s largest domestically designed aircraft. Now, it’s important to note that AVIC is no stranger to putting together lavish video presentations to mark major anniversaries in Chinese military aviation. But hidden at the very end of the just over five-minute long video is the brief view of what appears to be a flying-wing style aircraft under a sheet with the text “The Next…” in English. The clip never specifically mentions the H-20 and doesnâ€™t give any details about the aircraft, but it seems very likely that this was at least meant to represent the ongoing project.Â This is exactly how Northrop Grumman teased the B-21 on national television in the United States during Superbowl XLIX in 2015. To date, there have been no official pictures of the Raider and only very limited concept art of that aircraft. Below is the Northrop Grumman commercial, which first aired during the Super Bowl in 2015. Some have even suggested that the two clips are so close that the Chinese one may, in fact, be a heavily edited rip-off of Northrop Grumman’s ad itself and not part of the official AVIC video at all. It is definitely possible that China Defense Online added its own teaser to the end. However, a side-by-side comparison of the two clips shows that they are very distinct in many of the details. The timing is still slightly curious, though. The AVIC video began making the rounds shortly after James Drew, a reporter for Aviation Week, made a cryptic post on Twitter that many thought might lead to the first actual images of the B-21. A side-by-side comparison of the two clips., Northrop Grumman/AVIC via China Defense Online We now know that Drew’s teaser tweet was a prank and he actually ended up announcing that he will be joining Northrop Grumman Mission Systems as Manager of Global Media, but his Tweet had already set off a storm of speculation online. This included one post from a Chinese military forum that was clearly meant to troll the announcement with a screenshot of the apparent AVIC reveal. Check back some time in the future for a surprise. ğŸ™ƒ pic.twitter.com/BVRmeH5VjV — æ˜Ÿæµ· (@starmil_admin) May 8, 2018 Whatever the exact origins of the H-20 segment are, according to a basic machine translation of the short China Defense Online story accompanying the video, its title is â€œGreat Power Takeoff.â€ The bomber would certainly fit that description and presenting it in this way is clearly designed to demonstrate that China is capable of matching its western competitors.Â There have similarly been no confirmed photos or concept art at all of the H-20â€”though there are numerous fan-made renderings of what it might look likeâ€”despite XAC having reportedly been actively at work on the aircraft since the early 2000s. The 603rd Aircraft Design Institute is also linked to the project, which by most reliable accounts is crafting an aircraft broadly similar to Northrop Grummanâ€™s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. According to Airforces Monthly , reliable reports suggest the H-20â€™s basic design was largely frozen by 2011 and that XAC has built a number of subscale models, likely for aerodynamic and radar cross section evaluations , among other testing activities. Publicly available information suggests that base requirements called for an aircraft capable of carrying at least 10 tons of weaponry to an unrefueled range of 5,000 miles. This image, reportedly from China Central Television, is one of many floating around the internet claiming to show the H-20, but does not appear to be real., via Asia Times Its primary armament would likely be the CJ-10K air-launched land attack cruise missile, also known as the KD-20, which can carry either a conventional or nuclear payload and reportedly has a range of more than 930 miles. China has also shown examples of what may be a variant of the subsonic CJ-10 with low-observable characteristics itself . The combination of the H-20 with a stealthier weapon would significantly improve the survivability of both the launch platform and the likelihood of the weapon successfully reaching its target. Previous reports have pointed to a future Chinese doctrine of having bombers fly right to the edge of a potential opponentâ€™s airspace â€“ the most likely possible adversary being the United States â€“ before launching a missile barrage. The platform could serve as more than just a cruise missile truck, though. For regional conflicts, especially against potential opponents such as India, it could be important to be able to pierce through air defenses to conduct conventional strikes on various critical targets such as airfields, command and control sites, and critical air defense nodes. This could help clear the path for follow-on missions using non-stealthy aircraft during more sustained operations. All of this together would represent a significant jump in capability for the Chinese, who presently rely on upgraded H-6 bombers , derived from the Soviet-era Tu-16 Badger . Though more capable than the original design and now able to carry a variety of increasingly long-range stand-off weapons, including potentially air-launched ballistic missiles , those aircraft simply cannot project power far from Chinaâ€™s borders. Future versions with aerial refueling capability will allow them to fly missions further into the Pacific region, but the already dated design will only become more vulnerable to enemy aircraft and air defenses as time goes on. The video below shows China’s H-6Ks during a large-scale training exercise in 2015. â€œA medium-range bomber can’t essentially fix the PLA air force’s shortcomings in terms of strategic strike and strategic deterrence,â€ China Daily, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, reported in 2015 , citing Chinese defense technology magazine Aerospace Knowledge. â€œThus the air force does need an intercontinental strategic bomber capable of penetrating an enemy’s air defenses.â€ Beyond likely teasing the forthcoming H-20 aircraft, whatever it might look like in the end, â€œGreat Power Takeoffâ€ has a number of other details that also strongly indicate Chinaâ€™s desire to expand its strategic aviation capabilities. The video itself starts with the original H-6 bomber, which was the first Chinese military aircraft to drop a nuclear bomb at the Lop Nur test site in 1965. The clip includes archival video and a computerized rendering of that event. A computer rendering of an H-6A dropping a nuclear bomb over Lop Nur in 1965 from the AVIC video., AVIC via China Defense Online At another point in the video, starting at 3:25 in the runtime, you see a trio of older H-6 bombers flying through poor weather before shooting up into the sky. They appear to burn up as if they are leaving the atmosphere, but instead their skin peels away revealing the improved H-6K. These aircraft carry either stand-off land attack or anti-ship missiles under their wings and YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship missiles in their bomb bays. These latter weapons are the air-launched version of the anti-ship weapons China just reportedly installed on some of its man-made outposts in the South China Sea and represent a credible threat to opposing warships. The H-6K reportedly forms an important part of Chinese anti-access and area-denial capabilities in the region. A computer rending of an H-6K bomber firing a YJ-12 anti-ship missile from the AVIC video., AVIC capture via China Defense Online The video also ends with a much longer look at the Y-20 cargo aircraft that XAC has been working on since the mid-2000s. Visually similar to Boeingâ€™s C-17 Globemaster III, this aircraft could eventually give the Chinese military all-new strategic airlift capabilities that would also improve its ability to rapidly project power at greater distances. At present, the design remains limited by the lack of suitably powerful domestically-produced high-bypass turbofan engines to power it. But so significant is the Y-20 to the PLAâ€™s plans, that XAC reportedly slowed the H-20 bomber program to refocus resources into the cargo plane. Only after work on the initial airlifter prototype wrapped up in late 2012 did the company return to the H-20 in earnest. A rendering of the Y-20 airlifter from the AVIC video., AVIC capture via China Defense Online Whatever delays might have occurred with the H-20 program specifically, the countryâ€™s various state-run institutions and industrial enterprises have clearly been hard at work in the meantime on other advanced air combat technologies. These include other low observable military aircraft such as the J-20 fighter jet , to help reduce the gap in parity with the United States in particular. Just in the last 18 months, we have seen new imagery and information slip out concerning new stealth unmanned combat air vehicles and drone swarms , hypersonic and anti-satellite weapons , electromagnetic railguns , advanced sensors , and more . Unveiling the H-20 would be clearly in line with this apparent push, not only to modernize the Chinese military, but to potentially surge ahead of regional and international competitors and their respective capabilities. We might not have to wait much longer before finally catching a real glimpse of the new bomber. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Bombers H-20 Stealth"
Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 10, 2018",F/A-18E Pilot Had Hypoxia Symptoms After Diversion To Incirlik Air Base During Syria Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On May 3rd , the U.S. Navy supercarrier USS Harry S. Truman’s air wing began pummeling what’s left of the Islamic State in Syria after taking up station in the increasingly tumultuous Eastern Mediterranean. On May 7th, 2018, during one of these sorties, a flight of two F/A-18E Super Hornets , Freedom 52 and Freedom 55, from VFA-136 ‘Knighthawks,’ made an emergency diversion to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey . Upon landing, one of the pilots showed major symptoms of hypoxia and had to be assisted by ground personnel just to exit the fighter’s cockpit. We reached out to the Commander, Naval Air Forces public affairs office regarding the incident and they promptly confirmed that the diversion did occur and that one pilot had a physiological incident in the cockpit that included symptoms of hypoxia—the lack of oxygen to the brain and other bodily tissues. The War Zone’s sources say that the flight originally diverted due to a warning of an oxygen system malfunction in one Super Hornet, but once on the ground, another emergency was declared by the pilot of the other F/A-18E who began experiencing symptoms of hypoxia. The bizarre incident comes as the Navy and the Air Force continue to struggle with finding the culprit of oxygen woes that have seemed to spread across multiple types of disparate tactical and training aircraft . These physiological incidents have grounded entire aircraft fleets for months at a time and have even manifested themselves in different ways on the same type of aircraft. USN The Navy’s Hornet, Growler, and Super Hornet fleet, in particular, have experienced a major spike in physiological incidents over the better part of a decade. Issues with the flow of oxygen to the pilot have become by far the most numerous types of incidents, but they have also included horrific over-pressurization incidents while on the ground and the complete loss of environmental control flying at high altitude, even leaving pilots navigating blindly in a sub-freezing iced-over cockpit. Our good friend, contributor, and retired Hornet Weapons System Officer Joe ‘Smokin’ Rizinka has described his own experiences with suffocating in a fighter from before these incidents made regular headlines. Congress has prodded the Navy and the Air Force to find a solution to the problem faster , but so far there has been no ‘smoking gun’ identified as the culprit. Procedural and operational changes, and the introduction of new wearable technologies , have been put in place in hopes of staving off potentially deadly incidents and to better understand what exactly is happening physiologically to aircrews that report dangerous physiological events. USN Originally it was hoped that something wrong with onboard oxygen generation systems (OBOGS) installed on modern fighter and trainer aircraft could be identified, but so far that hasn’t happened. Pilots have become more aware of how to better recognize the onset of hypoxia-like symptoms, which are insidious by their very nature, but these types of precautions do little to solve the root cause of the problem. And still, the fact that their own aircraft can pose as much a threat to them as the enemy remains a vexing paradox for many American combat aviators. As for the Harry S. Truman’s deployment, its return to the Eastern Mediterranean follows a similar history-making deployment in 2016 when it was the first supercarrier to execute combat operations from the locale in well over a decade. The USS George H.W. Bush also staged combat operations from the Eastern Mediterranean in 2017. During that deployment, the carrier’s embarked strike fighter squadrons developed new tactics for hitting the Islamic State and one of its Naval Aviators shot down a Syrian Su-22 during operations over the war-torn country.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 22, 2019","Germany, France Move Ahead With Joint C-130J Unit Amid Budget Woes and A400M Delays","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Germany is pushing ahead with its plans to buy six Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules aircraft, including three KC-130J tankers , as part of plans to establish a shared unit with France. The move could greatly expand the capabilities of the air forces in both countries, and make it less expensive for both parties to do so, but could cause problems for separate efforts to grow their respective Airbus A400M Atlas airlifter fleets. On May 4, 2018, the U.S. Military’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced that the U.S. State Department had approved the sale of three C-130J-30 and three KC-130J aircraft to Germany, along with spare parts, training assistance, technical support, and other ancillary equipment. The entire purchase had a total estimated value of $1.4 billion. The purchase plan has been in the works since at least 2016 and the German government hopes to reach initial operational capability with the type in 2021. The German Air Force, or Luftwaffe , expects to reach full operational capability in 2024, helped along by the deployment of the aircraft to Évreux-Fauville Air Base in France’s Normandy region. There Germany’s aircraft will join the French Air Force’s two C-130J-30s and two KC-130s to form a shared squadron. France received its new Hercules in January 2018, though it already operated more than 10 older C-130H models. “The first aircraft, even if it carries French insignia, is the starting shot,” Germany’s Lieutenant General Erhard Bühler, who is in charge of the planning team for Franco-German squadron at the German Ministry of Defense, said in January 2018 . “Only together can we accomplish the coming tasks of Europe. France and Germany, shoulder to shoulder, that is our future.” French Air Force personnel stand in front of a C-130J-30, left, and a KC-130J during a ceremony in January 2018., Lockheed Martin Ostensibly the new four-engine aircraft will be an interim substitute for the aging twin-engine Transall C-160 airlifters as it leaves French and German service. The product of a joint development between France and Germany, those aircraft first entered service in 1967 and are rapidly becoming unsustainable. Both countries have long planned on the Airbus A400M replacing those aircraft for good, effectively on a one-for-one basis. In the meantime, the stretched fuselage C-130J-30s will be able to carry significantly more cargo and payloads that are physically larger. The Hercules will have better range and be more efficient to operate, as well. A Luftwaffe Transall C-160 at the Berlin Airshow in 2016., Julian Herzog via Wikimedia For France especially, the KC-130s will give its Air Force the ability to refuel its own EC-725 Caracal combat search and rescue helicopters, also known as the H225M, without having to request support from other allies . The country’s existing KC-135FR aerial refueling tankers cannot fly slow enough to refuel the choppers and its A400Ms and C-160s both lack an aerial refueling capability at present. This could also give Germany the option of procuring helicopters with mid-air refueling capability in the future, which could be a particularly important consideration as it looks to buy a replacement for its CH-53G heavy lift types . Sikorsky’s new CH-53K King Stallion has an in-flight refueling probe as a standard option. The KC-130Js would also be able to refuel French and German fast jet combat aircraft if necessary, which could make them even more versatile for both countries. A French Air Force EC725 helicopter refuels from a US Air Force MC-130J Commando II special operations transport during a training exercise., French Ministry of the Armed Forces Both the C-130J-30s and KC-130s will be able to use many of the same types of runways that the C-160s can operate from now, including short, unimproved strips in remote areas. This will make the various Hercules a good option for supporting either country’s special operations forces or personnel engaged in peacekeeping, humanitarian, or similar small military interventions into areas with limited established infrastructure. France and Germany are both already heavily engaged in North and West Africa supporting United Nations and European Union-backed missions and rely heavily on the C-160 for operations in those areas. In addition, the arrangement will allow both countries to share the burden of operating and maintaining the shared fleet of C-130Js. In March 2017, France and Germany agreed to both contribute more than $130 million to pay for expanded infrastructure and training facilities to support the squadron at Évreux-Fauville Air Base. Sharing a common logistics pipeline for identical aircraft will also help keep costs down. The first C-130J-30 for France’s Air Force rolls out of the Lockheed Martin factory in Marietta, Georgia in 2017., Lockheed Martin This is just one of a number of military cooperation deals France and Germany are pursuing at present, including work on a new fifth-generation fighter aircraft and companion stealthy unmanned air combat vehicles . Burden sharing is an important component of all of these agreements. Driven in no small part by Russia’s increasingly assertive foreign policy and hostile attitude toward the NATO alliance, both countries are looking to increase defense spending and expand and modernize their military forces. At the same time, they’re both coming to terms with decades of shrinking military budgets since the end of the Cold War that wreaked havoc on readiness in general. These issues have had far more of an impact on the German armed forces than their French counterparts, however. For more than a year now, Germany has suffered one defense scandal after another, including having its entire submarine fleet out of action , refusing to take delivery of its newest frigates, and abysmal availability rates across the Luftwaffe’s various aircraft fleets . Earlier in May 2018, Der Spiegel magazine reported that less than a dozen of the German Air Force’s Eurofighter Typhoons had functioning Defensive Aids Sub Systems (DASS), which could leave them effectively unable to fly combat missions. This equipment includes the aircraft’s entire electronic support measures and electronic countermeasures suite, as well as missile warning receivers and chaff and flare dispensers. A pair of Luftwaffe Eurofighter Typhoons., Bundeswehr Der Spiegel said that shortages of air-to-air missiles and maintenance backlogs made the issue worse. Germany’s swing-wing Tornado jets, the Luftwaffe’s other primary combat aircraft, have similarly suffered decreasing availability in recent years, an issue we at The War Zone have touched on multiple times in the past. The shared C-130J squadron could definitely be a win-win for both countries. France would be able to share the burden of rapidly expanding this category of airlift and aerial refueling support, while Germany would be able to spread around at least some of the costs of the Luftwaffe’s desperately needed modernization efforts. But while the concept makes a lot of sense, it could also spell trouble for the A400M programs in both countries. Though the C-130Js are primarily intended to take over for the Transalls, they also fill an important niche that the larger Airbus airlifters can’t perform, even if they were meeting their cost estimates and delivery schedules. France’s relatively fast acquisition of its Hercules – a little over two years between getting U.S. approval and receiving the aircraft – was spurred on in part by continuing delays with the A400Ms, as well as the determination that the C-130Js were better suited to operations in countries such as Mali and Niger . Germany has reportedly come to many of the same conclusions . A Luftwaffe A400M., Bundeswehr In a vacuum, it’s true that both types of aircraft could be complementary. For France’s distributed operations in North and West Africa especially, and similar activities elsewhere in the future, an A400M could bring larger amounts of cargo into established regional airports, where C-130Js would then move it onward to smaller forward operating locations. The A400Ms are significantly larger aircraft that can carry much more cargo, which would reduce the number of sorties necessary to at least move the necessary equipment, personnel, and other supplies into a theater initially. The issue, of course, is that France and Germany have yet to be able to make good use of their A400Ms due to a number of delays and technical issues. In March 2018, Reuters reported that Germany, which has to date purchased the largest number of the Airbus transports – 53 in total – had identified significant risks with the aircraft. “It is not clear whether, when and how many mature deployable A400M will be available with the contractually required suite of tactical capabilities,” according to a confidential German military report that Reuters obtained. “There are significant risks associated with the availability of the required tactical capabilities at the time of the retirement of the C-160. A capability gap cannot be excluded after 2021.” A year earlier, the German military announced that it would continue to operate 13 of the 17 aircraft it already had, despite earlier attempts to sell, lease, or operate them together with other countries to try and save money on the underperforming aircraft. It had found no parties interested in taking the aircraft in part or in full. An A400M takes off during the Berlin Airshow in 2016., Bundeswehr As of December 2017, Germany’s share of the multi-national A400M program was the largest at more than $10 billion. France is the second largest participant, expecting to take delivery of a total of 50 aircraft in total. In February 2018, Airbus met with the stakeholders from all of the participating nations in London to try and negotiate a cap for fines over delays and deficiencies with the aircraft, citing fears that the project might cease to be fiscally viable if it could not come to an agreement. The parties agreed to rebaseline the program , resetting the delivery schedule and requirements, which will only further delay full delivery of the aircraft with full mission capabilities. Though officials in both countries say they remain committed to the Airbus aircraft in the long-term, the C-130Js will offer a critical capability in the near term. If the Hercules have to take on additional missions due to continued schedule slips with the A400Ms, and perform successfully in those roles, it might prompt serious questions about whether it makes sense to buy more of them instead of the larger airlifters. Germany has already made it clear it has no particular attachment to the initial run of A400Ms it has now. The C-130J may be less capable overall, but it’s also a type that’s in steady production and in very active service around the world with the U.S. military and other military forces. A Lockheed Martin LM-100J, the civilian version of the C-130J, which the company introduced in 2017., Lockheed Martin It’s not hard to see Germany or France deciding it makes sense to significantly trim their total orders of Atlases. With both countries underwriting much of the program and Airbus struggling to find new customers for the type, it’s not clear how a shrinking investment from Berlin or Paris could impact the program as a whole, especially given the latest negotiations in London. What does seem clearer is that the French and German Air Forces will be flying C-130Js together in the next few years, significantly improving both services capabilities and doing so in a cost-effective manner. It remains to be seen whether, if the project becomes a success and model for future cooperation, whether the two countries will reassess their broader requirements for airlifters in general.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 21, 2024",Putin Arrives At Fourth Inauguration In New Russian-Made Armored Limousine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Amid controversies and heightened tensions with the United States , the United Kingdom , and other countries in Western Europe , Russia’s authorities have formally inaugurated Vladimir Putin as president for the fourth time. In a particularly symbolic gesture, the head of state rode to the ceremony in an all-new Russian-made limousine, the first time the country’s head of state has a traveled in a new, domestically produced presidential car since the 1990s. Russia’s Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute – abbreviated NAMI – a government-run automatic research and development organization that dates back to the very beginning of the Soviet Union, crafted the vehicle in cooperation with Sollers JSC , a Russian holding company with stakes in various domestic car companies. The new vehicle replaces the modified Mercedes S600 Pullman the country’s Federal Protective Service, or FSO, had previously operated. Putin reportedly initiated the program, known as Project Cortege – a relatively archaic word that in English describes a person’s personal retinue or a solemn procession, such as a funeral – after winning his third presidential election in 2012. The limousine is the first in what officials say will be an entire fleet of 14 new “Unified Modular Platform” vehicles for the FSO, including sedans, minivans, and SUVs. Additional examples could go to other Russian government agencies. “[Putin] has already familiarized himself with the project and has seen its various stages,” Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov told Russian newspaper Izvestia in June 2017. “He even took ‘Prototype A’ for a drive; there wasn’t enough time to show ‘Prototype B’.” https://youtube.com/watch?v=2u24P7AinDk In April 2018, Manturov had warned that the vehicle might not be ready for its debut at Putin’s inauguration as initially planned, but it appears that NAMI and Sollers JSC were able to successfully deliver at least one vehicle for the ceremony. There is the possibility that the limo the Russian president used to take the less than 700-foot ride from the Kremlin’s Senate Building in Moscow to Andreevsky Hall is not in the final, production configuration. The Project Cortege limousine., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP Otherwise, the exact design specifications are classified and there is little information readily available about its likely characteristics and features. Though the vehicle is domestically produced, reportedly, NAMI hired German car firms Porsche and Robert Bosch to help in the development, with the former company supplying a 600-horsepower turbocharged V8 engine. NAMI developed a second, significantly more powerful engine itself and this could be one of the major differences between the A and B prototypes. Beyond that, the limos have all sorts of other features one might typically associate with high-end luxury vehicles, including a digital dashboard and onboard multimedia system. The pictures that exist so far show an obviously heavy-framed, stretched sedan-type limousine with ornate interiors with significant amounts of wood and leather. In December 2017, we got a look at the similarly opulent interior of Putin’s Tu-214PU presidential plane and you can read about Russia’s executive helicopter fleet here . The inside of one of the prototype Project Cortege limousines., Sputnik / Sergey Subbotin It’s clear that the Project Cortege limo has extensive armor, secure communications equipment, and other self-protection and emergency features to help guard Putin in a variety of different situations. The vehicle outwardly appears less heavily modified than the one the President of the United States uses at present , but its not clear if that actually reflects its ballistic protection or other capabilities. The American design, colloquially known as “The Beast,” has a number of advanced features , including night and infrared vision driving systems, a completely sealed passenger compartment with independent air supply, and a medical kit that includes a ready store of the president’s blood. It may also have a variety of James Bond-esque self-defense systems, reportedly capable of releasing oil slicks and tear gas, akin to the specialized trucks the U.S. government uses to transport nuclear weapons. Another view of the Project Cortege limo., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP Unfortunately, all of these features and an amazingly high degree of ballistic protection make the American vehicle exceptionally heavy and often difficult to maneuver on city streets. It is possible that the Russians might have opted for a less complex and more manageable vehicle, with other separate security procedures to offset any low level of proection. Video of Putin’s ride to Andreevsky Hall showed authorities had cleared the streets, and likely the surrounding buildings in the area, of bystanders entirely. A phalanx of officers from Russia’s Federal Protective Service, or FSO, escorted the car to its destination. FSO officers on motorcycles escort President Vladimir Putin in his Project Cortege limo to the inaguration ceremony., Vitaliy Belousov / Sputnik  via AP Not seen, but almost certainly nearby, would have been other FSO members, including sedans to try and intercept any hostile vehicles and mounted rapid-reaction elements in vans and SUVs. At present, the organization’s Special Purpose Garage, or GON, which maintains an entire fleet of vehicles dedicated to supporting the president and his closest advisers, contains Mercedes S-class sedans, Mercedes M- and G-class SUVs , Mercedes Sprinter vans, and Volkswagen T5 and T6 vans . All of these feature additional armor and other modifications. As with their American counterparts , they could also carry additional communications systems, electronic warfare systems to disrupt enemy transmissions or prevent terrorists from setting off roadside bombs, teams to dispose of explosives and other specialized tasks, and more robust medical capabilities. With a less ambitious design, the Project Cortege limo itself could also be cheaper to procure and operate, as well. As of 2017, the Russian government had already put at least nearly $300 million into the development program. Russia has already had to curtail a number of defense and security spending programs in recent years due to international sanctions and general fluctuations in the country’s economy, particularly due to a precipitous drop in the global price of crude oil . FSO personnel shoot from a moving Volkswagen T5 during a driving competition in February 2018., Vitaly Kuzmin In addition, Russia hopes that Project Cortege will serve as a springboard for the country to re-enter the global luxury vehicle market. Civilian versions of the various Project Cortege designs, which Sollers JSC plans to sell under a new brand Aurus, will be available in small numbers in 2019, with reported prices ranging from $95,500 and $111,500. “Aurus” is an amalgamation of “aurum,” the Latin word for Gold, and “rus” for Russia. Government budget cuts and a flagging economy may force NAMI and Sollers to scale back those plans, though. Back in 2016, NAMI claimed that it would have produced 5,000 examples of the various Aurus vehicles in total by the end of 2020. If this occurs, it will represent an impressive ability to expand production capacity on Sollers JSC’s part, which only plans to build approximately 200 vehicles in 2019. Artist’s conceptions of the civilian Aurus sedan, left, and minivan, at right., NAMI But Putin has long made the revitalization of Russia’s automotive industry, both for domestic consumption and international sales, a major priority. He has notably served as pitchman for Russian carmaker Lada on a number of occasions, but those publicity stunts have not always worked out as intended. In 2010, Putin heavily promoted the Lada Kalina compact car, driving it around the country to show off its supposedly good reliability and performance. As the trip went on, though, locals spotted a large convoy trailing the then-prime minister in his yellow Kalina, with an apparent, visually identical spare following behind, as well as a tow truck pulling a third that had already broken down. Then, in 2011, he had difficulty starting up a new Lada Granta sedan as the press watched on. Whatever the Project Cortege limousine’s actual capabilities are, it’s hard not to note the significance of a domestically produced presidential vehicle for Putin and Russia as a whole. On March 1, 2018, in an annual state-of-the-union type address, the president made new and pointed appeals to the country’s nationalist sentiments. “I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,” Putin declared. “You have failed to contain Russia.” Putting him inside a Russian vehicle rather than a German limousine – regardless of how German-engineered the Project Cortege series might be at the end of the day – is immensely symbolic of the country’s independence from foreign influence. Russia’s presidents had used modified Mercedes S-classes as their primary mode of ground transport since 1995, when then-President Boris Yeltsin stopped riding in the Soviet-era ZIL-41052 limo his administration had inherited from the last premier of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev. A ZIL-41047, similar to the Soviet-era presidential ZIL-41052., Vitaly Kuzmin It’s worth noting that The Beast appeared for the first time at President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009. This replaced a heavily modified Cadillac DTS limousine , which had itself first taken to the streets during President George W. Bush’s second inauguration in 2005. We’ll almost certainly be seeing more of this new presidential vehicle in the future, as well as other vehicles in the Project Cortege family. Hopefully, more information will become available as to its exact features, too. If civilian versions do make it to market, we may get an even better idea of just how the vehicles perform.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 14, 2018",Palestinians Now Sending Waves Of Incendiary Kites Across Gaza Border,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of the latest flare-up (literally) in the never-ending Palestinian-Israel conflict, kites carrying incendiary payloads are being sent from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, setting off a scourge of highly destructive fires. One blaze in the Be’eri Forest has been particularly devastating. Agricultural lands have also been set on fire by the wind-carried improvised weapons in recent days. Launches of burning kites have coincided with a rash of violent protests near the border fences that separate Gaza from greater Israel. Referred to collectively as the “Great March Of Return,’ these demonstrations have turned deadly , with some reports stating that 7,000 Gazans have been injured and 45 killed as a result of skirmishes with Israeli forces. The incendiary kites are especially problematic because they are incredibly easy to produce and rely on simple materials that are nearly impossible to embargo and/or interdict. What’s most concerning is that these improvised weapons are near impossible to shoot down, and even if they could be successfully engaged, their burning payloads will still land somewhere in Israeli territory. Incendiary kites adorned with swastikas fly across the Gaza border., AP Now it seems Israel Defense Forces are going to attempt to deter the launch of these kites in a similar fashion to how they deal with rocket barrages, by destroying the location of their origin. Earlier today, IAF aircraft struck a Hamas position near the border fence where incendiary kites were launched hours earlier. Israel is well equipped to identify and geolocate infrared events in the Gaza Strip as they have dealt with rocket launches from the territory for years. It is likely these same capabilities will now be adapted to finding and fixing targets where the flaming kites originate from. Far from a new invention or general asymmetric warfare concept , incendiary kites can be as simple as a plastic and balsa wood kite-like device with a tin can filled with burning fuel attached to it via a long cord. Similar devices have been sent across the border sporadically over the years but they have become a much more persistent and organized threat in recent weeks. The fact that Israel is entering into another drought , with very dry conditions becoming a harsh reality, has made the kites a far more effective, albeit indiscriminate source of destruction than in the past. Ynetnews.com quoted one local farmer as stating: “At first we really did think it was a gimmick, some kind of joke—an incendiary kite—but it turns out we were wrong in a big way. This antiquated weapon is giving us serious trouble and causing heavy damages.” Another farmer who saw his fields burn was quoted as saying: “When you see a burning kite flying through the air, everyone is immediately on edge and stops working. Everyone tracks it to make sure it lands in an open field and not on our crops. It’s absurd… Sometimes you see several kites coming in quick succession.” With no signs of the violence along the border receding and bolstered by the effectiveness of the tactic, the use incendiary kites is only likely to increase. Whether or not punitive air strikes will actually curtail their employment remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2018",Northrop Grumman’s ‘H03’ Firebird Spy Plane Is Now Flying At Mojave Air and Space Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently got an interesting look at what turned out to be the latest derivative of Scaled Composites Firebird optionally-manned long-endurance aircraft, also known as the H03. Now we’ve received additional images of the aircraft, which carries the civil registration code N326JG, in flight. Photojournalist David Wirth captured these latest pictures near the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Northrop Grumman, which owns Scaled Composites at present, has a hangar at the airport and that’s where the all-gray H03 had previously emerged. The aircraft has a large air data boom, indicative of flight test activities, but we don’t know if this was its first flight or not. Otherwise, the aircraft’s most prominent difference from the second iteration of the Firebird is the significantly longer wings. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Northrop Grumman has of the previous types, known as R02s, which carry the civil registration’s N241PR and N412DB. The original Firebird demonstrator, which has the tail number N355SX, remains linked directly to Scaled Composites in the FAA database. In addition, the H03 has a revised engine and nacelle configuration. The R02s reportedly used a single Lycoming TEO-540E engine, a turbocharged variant of a relatively simple design that dates back to 1957, as its powerplant.  That the aircraft only needed one these engines was good evidence of their highly efficient performance. As of 2012, Scaled Composites said the “production ready” design could use a “ heavy fuel ” powerplant. David Wirth The changes near the engine area suggest that the new version could have a different and more efficient or powerful powerplant to fly higher, longer, or with a larger payload. Scaled Composites’ demonstrator already boasted the ability to fly at a maximum altitude of between 30,000 and 35,000 feet and at a top speed of around 230 miles per hour. The company said it could stay aloft for up to 40 hours at a time. Beyond that, the H03 appears to largely share the same twin-boom and fuselage configuration as the R02s and looks to have a nearly identical two-person, side-by-side cockpit arrangement. A still unknown buyer reportedly requested the addition of the second seat so that the aircraft could accommodate a copilot, also acting as the payload operator, during manned flight. David Wirth David Wirth The sensor and equipment fit also appears to be unchanged since we last saw N326JG. There is a single, large, black sensor turret underneath the fuselage. The aircraft, like its predecessor, is presumably capable of carrying various electro-optical, infrared, or multi-spectral video cameras , along with laser range-finders and designators. There’s a “platter” antenna on the right boom, which is likely associated with a UHF satellite communications suite, as well various other antennas and aerials for other types of communications equipment and data links. The two black aerials under the wings are much more apparent in these new images, which likely work as line-of-sight UHF data links. David Wirth There appears to be another line-of-sight (LOS) data link under the nose and another one on top of the right tail. On the original Firebird and the R02s, personnel could install additional beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) links in the cockpit area for unmanned operations with an operator controlling the aircraft remotely from a ground station. It is said that the H03 can fly without a pilot in a similar configuration. However, it is almost certain that the H03 can carry additional sensors, such as imaging radars and multi-camera wide-area persistent surveillance systems, as well as other equipment, including communications relays and electronic intelligence gathering suites. The R02s had a number of modular payload bays to accommodate these systems and it is likely that this newer aircraft retains many of those same compartments. One of the two R02 Firebirds, the second iteration of the design., Northrop Grumman/Scaled Composites The original demonstrator also flew for a time with a sensor turret, what appeared to be a small radome, and an antenna array of the kind associated with signals intelligence equipment. The H03 looks like it could offer an even more capable intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform than its predecessors. The real mystery of this plane remains what customer or customers Northrop Grumman might have lined up to purchase it and/or other production examples in the future. As of 2012, the R02s reportedly cost $10 million each , including a rudimentary sensor and communications setup. This would make it an attractive and cost-effective competitor to various long-endurance manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, especially medium-altitude, long-endurance designs such as MQ-9 Reaper, and even the RQ-4 Global Hawk to a more limited degree. It could also offer a low-cost surrogate for those aircraft during training exercises or in order to test new equipment on a representative platform. The original Firebird demonstrator with its various sensors along the bottom of the fuselage., Northrop Grumman/Scaled Composites On top of that, compared to its strictly unmanned competitors, pilots would be more readily able to deploy the aircraft to a theater of operation before personnel there reconfigure it for unmanned operations, all with a relatively limited logistical footprint. With its modular equipment bays, a single aircraft could be a more flexible platform, as well, with crews swapping out systems as necessary. As noted the H03’s payload capacity could exceed that of the R02s, which could already reportedly carry almost 1,250 pounds of sensors and other systems in their fuselages and sponsons. Now that N326JG is clearly flying, we’ll be keeping an eye out to see where it might turn up next, and in what configuration, which could offer new clues as to potential buyers and what missions they have in mind for the aircraft.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s Friday and amazingly we don’t have any breaking news to deal with, which is a rarity these days. So let’s step away from the policy, tactics, technology, and strategy for a second to enjoy the best that mother internet has to offer in terms of viral military aviation clips this week.Â 1.) It’s ‘May the 4th be with you day’ and this clip looks like it was ripped right from The Last Jedi â€”or maybe it’s the other way around? Regardless, the video shows a quartet of Turkish T129 attack helicopters pouring 20mm cannon fire onto a single target at dusk. The tracers look like lasers and it’s pretty safe to say they obliterated whatever they were aiming at with their creeping volley of shells.Â After I retweeted this on my twitter account I was pointed to another video that includes in-cockpit footage of two T129s pummeling the same target, which is pretty cool as well: 2.) This one comes from Military.com reporter Oriana Pawlyk who traveled with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson on a C-37 VIP chariot to the Florida Panhandle to check out a bunch of Air Force happenings down there. This apparently included the test firing of a GAU-8 Avenger cannon . Not much to see here, but the sound is amazing. Turn up the volume to get fully BRRRRRRRRRRTTTTed! Your welcome for making your day. 3.) Next, we have a video showing a pair of F/A-18F Rhinos in formation at sunset as they accelerate away from the camera-ship in full burner and then break downward together right into the setting sun. You may have to get the tissues because this one is so beautiful it will bring a tear to your eye. Also, there’s some good audio, including hearing the burners of the Super Hornets’ GE-F414 turbofans even inside the point-of-view aircraft and the outbursts of a very excited spectator. I am not sure what aircraft the video was taken from, maybe it was an E-2 Hawkeye? View this post on Instagram A post shared by Combat learjet (@combat_learjet) 4.) This video takes us inside the cockpit of a Super Etendard Modernise (SEM) while landing aboard France’s nuclear carrier the Charles de Gaulle. The old SEMs were not known for their power or high-tech features and were true ‘stick and rudder’ naval tactical jets. As you can see, the amount of throttle, stick, and trim inputs required to get one safely on the deck is almost comical. Then again, when you think about the skill required to make it happen, it sure seems a lot more serious. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Global Military Aviationï¸ï¸ğŸ— (@globalair) The SEMs were finally retired two years ago from French service, you can read all about their sundown and legacy here , but a handful of them were just sold to Argentina so that they could reconstitute their Etendard operations.Â 5.) Finally, we have a quieter video, one that shows what it’s like landing an F-16 in very low visibility conditions. If you are a regular reader or follow me on twitter you know about my fascination with the Viper , its bubble canopy, and its incredible visibility. So any F-16 cockpit video is usually worthwhile watching. But what’s also worth pondering is how General Dynamics installed so much functionality and ergonomics into the F-16’s cockpit design . When looking at the compact and uncluttered cockpit you have to wonder how the aircraft is able to be flown like a normal airplane as well as a weapon. Just look at a Boeing 737’s flight deck or that of a business jet for comparison. https://www.instagram.com/p/BiFzj62nxBD Even with the bad visibility, the pilot was able to grease the landing, which is notoriously tough to do in the Viper.Â So there you have it, my top five military aviation videos of the week pulled from around the low-rent garage sale that is social media.Â Have a great weekend gang!

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019","Leaked Report Points To Accuracy, Reliability Issues With The Marine Corps’ Newest Rifles","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps continues to push ahead with plans to make Heckler and Koch’s M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle the service’s standard infantry weapon, as well as the platform for a new designated marksman rifle called the M38 . At the same time, a test report has surfaced that raises concerns about whether the M38 is accurate enough to perform in that role and whether either of the weapons will work reliably with sound suppressors. TheFirearmBlog.com obtained the Marine Corps Systems Command report and posted a copy online in April 2018. The document is marked 2015 and “For Official Use Only,” but clearly states that it covers evaluations that ran through 2016, suggesting the cover date may be a typo. The test specifically evaluated the M38, which the Marines identified at the time as the “M27 Special Purpose Rifle,” but many of the data points apply equally to both weapons. The designated marksman rifle version, which the Marines are already fielding operationally, is essentially the same as the base M27 weapon with a Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope on top. In 2011, the Corps first began issuing M27s as a substitute for the larger M249 Squad Automatic Weapons in its infantry squads. According to the report, the Marine Corps’ requirement for the M27-based designated marksman rifle emerged in 2014 when it retired its stock of Mk 12 Mod 1 Special Purpose Rifles. Originally designed by the U.S. Navy for special operations forces, these Marines obtained these weapons to meet urgent demands from the service’s conventional units in 2007. The Mk 12 Mod 1 was a heavily modified M16A1 rifle. Though the M27, itself a variant of Heckler and Koch’s HK416, is derived from the M16-series of rifles, it uses a different operating mechanism with a physical piston over the barrel to cycle the weapon’s action. This system has proven more reliable than the original AR-15/M16-pattern design, which siphoned some propellant gas from the barrel and used it to directly move the gun’s internal components. As a result, this would blow carbon particles matter straight into the center of the rifle, which could build up over time and cause the gun to jam unless the operator was careful to clean the weapon regularly and thuroughly. Though the report says that the combination of the M27 rifle with the Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope met nearly all of the test objectives, it has a number of extremely significant caveats. The most obvious issue is the scope itself, which is a dated design that the Marine Corps reportedly chose because it already had them in inventory, left over from the Mk 12 Mod 1 rifles. “They’re trying to justify using archaic optics they found sitting on a shelf somewhere,” an unnamed former Marine Corps sniper told Marine Corps Times before the test report emerged in April 2018. “Anyone that thinks that optic is acceptable is completely and utterly removed from current optics choices, training, DM [designated marksmen] operations, and reality.” The Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/Ts have a reticule pattern that does not feature range measurements in the same units of measure as the external adjustment knobs. As the TheFirearmBlog.com noted, this means a shooter cannot make easy changes by turning the knobs a certain amount based solely on what they see through the scope. Marines train with Mk 12 Mod 1 rifles in Iraq in 2009., USMC More worrisome, by using the existing optics, Marine Corps Systems Command also decided it could limit testing to determine whether or not the scopes were truly suitable when installed on the M27s. The evaluators themselves noted that data about how well the scope worked on the older Mk 12 Mod 1s might not reflect its performance on the new rifles. “The TT [test team] limited the amount of rounds fired to 2700 rounds per weapon based on the successful performance of the Leupold Mark 4 Scope on the Mk 12 Mod 1,” the report says.  “There is [a] risk that the optic may not perform as well or in the same manner under a higher round count on the M27.” The Marine Corps has largely dismissed these concerns, saying that the M38 is more than accurate enough for the designated marksman role. It is important to note that the weapon is not intended a high-precision sniper rifle. “I don’t doubt that they [Marine snipers] don’t like it,” now-retired Chief Warrant Officer 5 Christian Wade, who previously served as in the 2nd Marine Division and was at the head of a number of experimental infantry modernization efforts, told Marine Corps Times . “The M38 is not intended for scout snipers. The M38 is only supposed to be in the rifle squads.” A Marine holds an M38 designated marksman rifle during an evaluation in 2017., USMC But there are concerns for how the combination might stand up to the rigors of more conventional use, too. The test points related to the scopes only involved data taken when shooters fired shots in the semi-automatic fire mode, as one would expect from designated marksman. Much of the available information about the scope in combination with the Mk 12 Mod 1 also involved predominately semi-automatic fire. Marines now armed with the M38 may find themselves called upon to perform more traditional infantry duties, as well, which could call for fully automatic suppressive fire. “There is [a] risk that the optic and/or suppressor may not perform as well or in a similar manner under extended automatic fire,” the report notes, adding that the optic might just end up damaged to some degree from the strain. The report also prompts serious questions about whether the M27 or the M38 are reliable when shooting with a suppressor attached. This is a particularly significant issue given that the Marines are exploring the potential of issuing these devices to infantry units on a broad basis and are looking to make the M27 the standard rifle across the service . The evaluators reviewed two different suppressors during the tests, the Knight’s Armament Company (KAC) QDSS-NT4 and a modular Operator Suppressor Systems (OSS) unit made up of its Back Pressure Regulator (BPR) and a Signature Reduction Module (SRM). The KAC product is already in widespread service across the U.S. military and operator surveys during the tests showed it was the preferred option. The Marines found that the OSS system was more complex, maintenance intensive, and difficult to quickly install and remove, even though it produced better accuracy results. A Marine trains with an M27 equipped with a KAC QDSS-NT4 suppressor in December 2017., USMC The KAC suppressor, on the other hand, was more user-friendly, but threw off the aim – “point of impact,” or POI – of the weapon by an average of nearly two and half minutes of angle. When it comes to firearms, this unit of measurement, abbreviated MOA, is best understood as a cone with a circle at its base that grows one inch in diameter for every 100 yards. A weapon with a stated accuracy of approximately one MOA can reliably hit within a one-inch diameter circle at 100 yards and an 8-inch diameter one at 800 yards. Shifting the point of impact two and half minutes of angle equates to sending the bullets off target up to 20 inches away at 800 yards. Some of the test weapons had deviations closer to five minutes of angle. The Marines’ stated requirement was no more than a two MOA shift when an operator put the suppressor on. This change in accuracy could effectively preclude users from switching rapidly from suppressed to unsuppressed operations in the field, where they might not be able to quickly adjust their sights. Otherwise, they might have to estimate the new point of impact and manually adjust their point of aim. At the time of the test, the Marines threw out these concerns, as well. “It is the Test Manager’s opinion that POI shift is not as important as it once was,” the report concludes. “Marine Corps snipers are interested in what the POI shift is for their weapon, but their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP’s) call for them to shoot suppressed rather than unsuppressed. If the TTP for the SPR will require the operator to shoot suppressed rather than unsuppressed, then this attribute should be changed.” A Marine fires an M27 without a sound suppressor., USMC The Marines are moving toward a doctrine where shooting suppressed will be a standard practice for regular infantry units using both M27s and M38s. The attribute will have to change, if it hasn’t already, and it’s not clear how that might affect either weapon’s suitability for routine operation with a suppressor. On top of that, suppressors as a general rule also produce additional pressure on the operating mechanism since they capture propellant gasses in a confined chamber right at the muzzle of the gun. This in turn typically causes the action to cycle faster than it would without the device installed. The OSS suppressor’s BPR is specifically there to mitigate this issue. During the tests, the M27s with the KAC suppressor suffered a significant number of jams, almost all attributed to the increased cyclic rate. These failures occurred during both semi-automatic and fully-automatic fire. Taken together, all of these issues raise important questions about the Marine Corps’ near-term plans for the M38 and the wider issue of M27s with suppressors. Modifications to either the weapons or purchase of new optics or suppressors with improved features might reduce or even eliminate the problems, but could easily incur additional costs. Based on the reviews of the OSS suppressor, adding improved ancillary equipment onto the guns in the future could make them more expensive to operate and maintain, as well. The price of the rifles, which have been significantly higher than earlier M16-pattern guns, has long been an issue. Members of Congress have openly questioned the wisdom of the Marines desire to rapidly buy thousands more of the guns without holding an open competition, especially to a foreign-headquartered firm. At the end of April 2018, the service issued its latest sole-source deal with Germany-based Heckler and Koch’s American subsidiary for up to 15,000 more M27s and spare parts. That contract could be worth nearly $30 million. In this latest purchase, though, each M27 will cost the Marines around $1,300. This is less than half the cost the service had paid per weapon in the past, suggesting that the increased orders had led to lower unit costs. “What I expect is that with the issuance of the M27 to all Marines in every squad, the ongoing mass employment of suppressors, and the development of variable power optics, every Marine in the squad will have the M38 capability in his own rifle,” retired Chief Warrant Officer 5 Wade said in his interview with Marine Corps Times. “The rifleman with an M27 IAR [Infantry Automatic Rifle], suppressor, variable power optic, advanced NODs [night vision], etc. who is fully trained, is a game changer.” In the meantime, unfortunately, Marines will have to make do with the rifles, scopes, and suppressors they have now, which could be less accurate and less reliable under actual operational conditions than advertised.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 1, 2018",SAMs And Anti-Ship Missiles Are Now Guarding China’s Man-Made South China Sea Islands,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has sharply criticized China for establishing new air and anti-ship defenses on a number of man-made outposts in the disputed South China Sea. Something we at The War Zone have warned has been increasingly inevitable for years, these developments are the latest example of China’s long-standing determination to limit the ability of foreign militaries, especially the United States, to operate in the region and suggests the country may be adopting an assertive foreign policy more broadly. On May 2, 2018, CNBC , citing sources with knowledge of U.S. intelligence reports, reported that China had deployed HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles and YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles on Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef, and Subi Reef. China first began artificially expanding all three of these locations in the hotly disputed Spratly Islands, among others, in 2014 and has since transformed each one into outposts capable of sustaining various ground, air, and naval forces. A significant escalation “We’re well aware of China’s militarization of the South China Sea,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on May 3, 2018. “There will be near-term and long-term consequences.” “We have been very vocal about our concerns about them militarizing these artificial islands,” Dana White, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, also said on May 3, 2018, in a separate press conference. “China has to realize that they have benefited from the free navigation of the sea and the U.S. Navy has been the guarantor of that.” A map showing all of China’s outposts in the South China Sea, along with those belonging to other countries in the region, as of 2017., DOD Earlier, an unnamed Pentagon spokesperson had told CNBC’s said China’s latest additions “will only serve to raise tensions and create greater distrust among [other] claimants” in the South China Sea, but that’s putting things mildly. If the specific details are true, the addition of the HQ-9Bs and YJ-12Bs would represent a significant challenge to any military force attempting to operate in the area during a crisis. A long-range surface-to-air missile system, similar in size and capability to Russia’s S-300 series , the HQ-9 represents one of the Chinese military’s most capable air defense weapons. It is reportedly capable of engaging aircraft, including low-flying manned and unmanned types, as well as cruise missiles. According to Jane’s , the B variant has a dual mode seeker with semi-active radar and infrared homing capabilities, making it more flexible against a variety of targets, and much harder to defeat using countermeasures. Transporter-erector-launchers associated with the Chinese HQ-9 surface-to-air missile system during a parade in Beijing in 2015., Imaginechina via AP Images The YJ-12B, a heretofore unknown version of the air-launched YJ-12 , is a supersonic land-based anti-ship cruise missile. At least visually, the design appears to be a derivative of the Soviet-era Kh-31 . The B nomenclature suggests that this is a further improved version of the previously reported YJ-12A ground-launched type. Already reportedly capable of making evasive maneuvers to avoid close-in defense systems, this variant could feature additional counter-countermeasures. Trucks carry YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missiles during a parade in Beijing in 2015., Imaginechina via AP Images The HQ-9B has an approximate range of more than 120 miles, depending on the altitude of the target, while the air-launched YJ-12 has a maximum range of between 200 and 250 miles. The ground-launched YJ-12B could have an additional booster to extend its range, as well. Of course, this isn’t the first time China has deployed HQ-9s to the South China Sea. In 2016 , they placed the surface-to-air missile systems on Woody Island further north from the three reefs in question. They also previously added shorter-range guns to all of these locations. But together, these weapons form a much more significant buffer around the three reefs, which occupy an especially strategic position between other countries with claims in the South China Sea, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. During an actual conflict, it could easily present a barrier to other foreign forces attempting to enter the area and that would appear to be the point. There’s nothing to suggest that they couldn’t do the same on other outposts in the South China Sea, as well. The air- and anti-ship defenses could help protect follow-on deployments of even longer range weapons, including medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. China’s DF-26, which is officially entered service in April 2018, is capable of attacking targets as far as away as Guam from the Chinese mainland. A subvaraint can also reportedly engage large ships, as can the existing DF-21D . Positioning either of these weapons inside the South China Sea would increase the country’s ability to challenge foreign naval movements, in particular, U.S. Navy carrier groups , across a much wide swath of the western Pacific. DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles on parade in Beijing in 2015., Imaginechina via AP Clear policy But as we at The War Zone have noted for years, these new developments are not only not surprising, they have been an almost guaranteed outcome of the Chinese land reclamation project in the South China Sea and inaction early on by the United States to challenge that work. In 2015, then at Foxtrot Alpha, our own Tyler Rogoway wrote : China is taking desolate reefs among the Spratly Islands and building them into man-made bases. Some see this as no more than a navigational headache and a regional issue with little impact. Others, however, believe it’s a much more subversive activity, giving China the ability to claim a vast economic exclusion zone where it could control shipping, fishing, energy production, and even air travel over one of the busiest transportation corridors in the world. Some of China’s newly built islands are rumored to eventually become highly defended stationary “aircraft carrier battle groups” where they could house fighter aircraft, long range sensors, and missile systems – both of the surface-to-surface and surface-to-air variety. In doing so, China would be in the process of creating a fortress-like network of sea bases where it could project power and literally control the flow of a large portion of the world’s shipping. … In actuality, China has every reason not to make a deal to share this highly strategic territory with its neighbors, including energy, fishing, shipping and air travel control, and will most likely just rely on the passive threat posed by its massive military as a deterrent against aggression and intervention. The only way to really have a shot at reversing what could be the biggest and most volatile territorial dispute of our time is to engage with China directly on the issue now, before construction on these islands is complete. Considering how distracted the Obama Administration is with a whole slew of other issues, both external and internal, it’s doubtful that this will happen. Meanwhile, the play clock is ticking down, and China is well aware of this. In September 2015, China’s President Xi Jinping appeared to make a pledge not to do any of this after meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama. And while it may now seem that this promise was particularly hollow, it is important to consider the language in the appropriate context. “Relevant construction activity that China is undertaking in the Nansha Islands does not target or impact any country and there is no intention to militarize,” Xi declared in 2015 , using the Chinese name for the Spratlys. But in the same remarks, he added that “we have the right to uphold our own territorial sovereignty and lawful legitimate maritime rights and interests.” Then US President Barack Obama, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during a meeting 2016., Kyodo via AP The Chinese have staked a claim that effectively encompasses the entire South China Sea. While the latest missile deployments definitely reflect an aggressive stance toward other countries in the region, China sees its activities there as legitimate “defensive” moves to protect its sovereignty territory from their claims. Other countries in the region, as well as international courts and regulatory bodies, have similarly challenged the validity of China’s claims in the South China Sea. Notably, in 2016, an international tribunal at The Hague sided with The Philippines in a specific dispute over Scarborough Shoal, further to the northeast of the three newly armed reefs, and declared that Chinese authorities had no long-standing historical claim to the region. China, not surprisingly, rejected that decision. However, the Philippines’ present firebrand President Rodrigo Duterte has largely dropped the issue as part of efforts to improve relations with the Chinese government, eliciting a pledge from Xi’s government not to expand in Scarborough , at least as long as he’s in office. It’s also worth noting that in 2015 the United States said it had reached a deal with China to stop dangerous intercepts of American intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, including over the South China Sea. The aggressive encounters have continued, even after the Navy decided to add camera pods on its EP-3E Aries II intelligence aircraft to record the incidents. In May 2017 , a People’s Liberation Army Air Force Su-30MKK Flanker buzzed a WC-135C Constant Phoenix atmospheric sampling plane as it transited over the East China Sea. A Chinese J-11 Flanker fighter jet lands on Woody Island, on of its reclaimed, man-made outposts in the South China Sea, in 2015., China Military Online A de facto claim On a broad level, China has steadily developed a variety of mechanisms, including military deterrents and regulatory challenges , to enforce its claims in the South China Sea. The new missiles on the three reefs can only help add to this de facto boundary regardless of any international criticisms or legal decisions. The move could prompt other claimants to reinforce their own claims – Vietnam has already moved Israeli-made EXTRA artillery rocket system within range of China’s outposts – but short of an all-out conflict, it’s not clear what any party, of their allies, such as the United States, could necessarily do to check the flow of more Chinese military equipment into the region. In adding the surface-to-air and anti-ship missiles, authorities in Beijing are making it more difficult to for its opponents to contemplate any sort of armed intervention, as well. DOD/DigitalGlobe DOD/DigitalGlobe DOD/DigitalGlobe And the deployment of the new missiles is only the most recent in a string of Chinese anti-access and area denial developments in the region, too. In April 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that China had installed electronic warfare systems on at least some of its outposts in the region. Since at least 2013 , the Chinese have reportedly been interested in jamming U.S. military aircraft to keep them out of the South China Sea, but the recent report suggested that China was more actively targeting American military aircraft, possibly interfering with their radars, navigation equipment, or communications systems. Shortly afterward, GMA News , a Filipino outlet, provided additional evidence of this, citing an unnamed U.S. Navy aviator. “[T]he mere fact that some of your equipment is not working is already an indication that someone is trying to jam you,” the individual reportedly told GMA News. “And so we have an answer to that.” This is on top of expanding underwater listening posts and sensor nets , as well as increased routine air and naval patrols and training exercises. In March 2018, dozens of People’s Liberation Army Navy ships, including its sole operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning , took part in an especially large show of force off Hainan Island. All of this provides a very visible demonstration of China’s determination to enforce its policy preferences in the region. Branching outward In addition, the Chinese have begun more actively operating in the seas and air in other disputed areas, such as areas Japan claims in the East China Sea . China is also looking to expand its network of overseas bases that could allow it to better project power on an international level, with reports of potential developments in Vanuatu , close to Australia and the Maldives , in India’s traditional sphere of influence. Expanded naval cooperation with long-time ally Pakistan is another possibility and China is looking into developing additional partnerships in the Indian Ocean and in East Africa. And as the news of China adding additional weaponry to its outposts in the South China Sea emerged, the U.S. military accused them of harassing American aircraft flying in the East Africa country of Djibouti, which hosts a major American base , with blinding laser “dazzlers.” The attacks had left two aviators with temporary injuries and could be a sign of growing tensions between the two parties in that region. In 2017, these Chinese opened their own military facilities less than a mile from the U.S. military’s Camp Lemonnier in the highly strategic country. People’s Liberation Army Navy personnel stand at attention during a ceremony at the Chinese base in Djibouti., AFP via Getty Images “U.S. Africa Command views security and access to Djibouti as a top priority,” U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of U.S. Africa Command, which manages operations in Djibouti, told legislators in March 2018. “Consequently, we continue to monitor this [Chinese] development to ensure U.S. interests are not deterred.” Having added facilities in foreign countries, or established agreements to use their deepwater ports, makes perfect sense if China wants to be able to conduct long-range naval operations in the future, especially using the carrier battle groups that it is in the process of building. The PLAN has already built a dock that is able to accommodate Liaoning on its own Hainan Island in the northern end of the South China Sea. The carrier and its escorts will almost certainly be regular guests at foreign ports of call where China is looking to expand its influence in the future. “China’s impressive military buildup could soon challenge the United States across almost every domain,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command and nominee for Ambassador to South Korea, told lawmakers in February 2018. “China’s intent is crystal clear. We ignore it at our peril.” US Navy Admiral Harry Harris, left, meets with Chinese military officials in 2015., Kyodo via AP Few ways to respond But as noted, short of taking actual military action, it’s not clear what the United States might be able to reverse the situation in the South China Sea. Adding additional capabilities to pierce through Chinese anti-access and area denial screens, such as advanced low-observable aircraft and stealthy stand-off weapons , hypersonic weapons that can strike at extreme distances with little warning, and improved surface, air, and space-based sensors will help the U.S. military keep its qualitative edge in any potential conflict. Having those systems in place does little to challenge China’s physical possession of large swaths of the region, though. Freedom of navigation patrols at sea and in the air through the South China Sea also demonstrate that the United States and its partners do not accept the Chinese claims, but again have little impact on military activities in places such as Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration already have a complicated relationship with China more broadly, both lauding its help in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table and sanctioning its citizens and businesses for enabling the regime in Pyongyang. Trump, who routinely praises his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, has also pushed for major trade restrictions on Chinese imports and exports, which has prompted threats of retaliation from officials in Beijing. In theory, diplomatic and economic pressure might produce some concessions from Xi’s government, but China has so many partners internationally that it could be especially difficult to isolate them in any way. In the meantime, At least when it comes to the South China Sea, the additional missiles only make it more difficult for the United States and other countries in the region to challenge China’s aspirations. And that’s exactly the plan. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles DF-26 Land Naval Munitions Sea Surface-To-Air Missile Systems"
Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 10, 2018",US Military Says Chinese Lasers Injured Pilots Flying A C-130 Near Its Base in Djibouti,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. government has now publicly accused Chinese personnel of dangerous laser activity near the American base at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti , which it says has physically harmed the pilot and co-pilot of a U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules. Though it may only be a nuisance now, it could represent a desire on the part of China’s forces to challenge the United States’ ability to freely operate in and around the vital region hub. On May 3, 2018, Dana White, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said lasers from China’s base in the East African country had harassed American aviators on between two and 10 occasions , resulting in two, unspecified minor injuries to the C-130 crew. She also indicated that there had been an increase in these activities recently, prompting American officials to make a formal complaint. The issue had prompted the U.S. military to issue a formal warning to its own aircrews in April 2018 , which did not specifically name who was responsible. “I’d have to ask you [to] ask the Chinese about the motivation,” White said. “But it’s serious, we take it seriously, and that’s why we demarched them.” In 2017, China officially began operations at its own base in Djibouti, which it describes as a logistics hub , but hosts a large marine contingent with armored vehicles and other heavy weapons. The Chinese government first announced plans to build the facilities, which are situated less than a mile from their American counterparts in the country, in 2015. The video below shows Chinese troops stationed at its base in Djibouti conducting live-fire exercises in the country. https://youtube.com/watch?v=VYN5zXPDnYs The U.S. military has been running operations from Camp Lemonnier since 2003 and it is the only formal base the United States says it has in Africa. It has since served as an important hub for air operations into Somalia and Yemen , as well as vital stop-over point for American forces transiting through the area. It appears the Pentagon is, at least for the time being, leaving the possibility open that individual Chinese personnel might have been acting independently in Djibouti and that the laser harassment is not a matter of actual policy. However, U.S. Air Force Major Sheryll Klinkel, a Pentagon spokesperson, separately told reporters that the device used to attack the crew of the C-130 was clearly “military grade.” Both China and the United States have consented to the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, a 1995 addition to the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which bans the use of lasers with a specific “combat function” to cause “permanent blindness.” At the same time, both countries have made it clear that they do not believe that ostensibly “non-lethal,” lower-power laser “dazzlers” do not violate this agreement as the impairment is not “permanent.” The video below shows U.S. Marines in Iraq in 2008 training to use a green-light laser “dazzler” to help stop suspicious vehicles. https://youtube.com/watch?v=mcsdtyVra1w The treaty specifically exempts laser-based defensive systems that blind the seeker heads on incoming missiles or disrupt other sensors systems. “Blinding as an incidental or collateral effect of the legitimate military employment of laser systems, including laser systems used against optical equipment, is not covered by the prohibition of this  Protocol,” it adds. As of 2015, Chinese forces had access to at least four different man-portable systems, the BBQ-905, PY131A, PY132A, and the WJG-2002, all of which look like oversized assault rifles or shoulder-fired grenade launchers. The WJG-2002’s shape clearly mimics the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) standard QBZ-95 assault rifle, undoubtedly to help conceal the weapon’s presence on the battlefield. A Chinese soldier aims a WJG-2002 laser weapon., via China Military Online “China has been updating its home-made blinding laser weapons in recent years to meet the needs of different combat operations,” a report from China Military Online, an official PLA outlet said in 2015, according to an English translation. “Blinding laser weapons are primarily used to blind its targets with laser in short distance, or interfere and damage the laser and night vision equipment, etc.” The exact range and capabilities of these weapons are unclear. But whether the effects are permanent or not, even temporary blindness can be a serious hazard for aviators. Pranksters have caused significant disruptions in the past around commercial airports using readily available laser pointers, which have in turn led to serious criminal charges . A PY131A dazzler sits in front of a PY132A., via China Military Online “When aimed at an aircraft from the ground, the powerful beam of light from a handheld laser can travel more than a mile,” the FBI told The Washington Free Beacon in 2015. It can “illuminate a cockpit, disorienting and temporarily blinding pilots.” In April 2018, a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jet crashed during an exercise in Djibouti, with the pilot being able to safely eject. One of the Marines CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters also suffered damage in a hard landing. There is nothing to suggest, at present, that either of these incidents were related to the hostile laser activity, though. There is the possibility that the incidents are unintentional. Earlier in May 2018, the qausi-official Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on the laser issue, but suggested that harassment could have been the result of unrelated attempts by Chinese personnel to scare away birds. Bird strikes are a serious hazard for both military and civil aviation, but shotguns and other traditional firearms firing extremely loud blanks have historically been the weapon of choice to disperse the avian threats. A member of the People’s Liberation Army Navy on board the aircraft carrier Liaoning holds a shotgun, a far more common means of dispersing potentially dangerous birds from the flight line., China Military Online The same report also said it was equally likely that the harassment was intended to blind sensors and prevent them from spying on the Chinese base. Not knowing the full extent of the reported injuries or the exact nature of the various incidents, its hard to judge whether or not the crews of the American aircraft were the actual targets. But there have long been concerns about whether the proximity of the two sites, and the lack of any formal communication between them, could create problems. It was apparent from the beginning that both sides could use the opportunity to try and gather intelligence about the other. “We’ve never had a base of, let’s just say a peer competitor, as close as this one happens to be, so there’s a lot of learning going on, a lot of growing going on,” U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.S. Africa Command, which oversees operations in Djibouti, told Breaking Defense in March 2017. “Yes, there are some very significant operational security concerns.” We don’t know whether or not an intelligence collection or other confrontations have now escalated into a more aggressive exchange between the two parties. However, China clearly sees its presence in Djibouti as an important development in expanding its own ability to project power internationally and it almost certainly sees it as part of a broader challenge to United States interests and influence. U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser speaks to members of Congress in March 2018., Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP On top of that, China has a long history of challenging the U.S. military’s freedom of movement closer to home, especially in the South China Sea . Despite an agreement President Barack Obama’s administration struck with Chinese authorities in 2015, the PLA continues to aggressively intercept American aircraft throughout the Pacific in areas China claims as its sovereign territory. The Chinese government has also made a concerted effort to expand its more robust area denial capabilities, particularly in and around the South China Sea, reportedly launching electronic warfare attacks on American aircraft from its man-made outposts in the region and establishing advanced sensor nets , including underwater listening posts , to monitor foreign military activities. “U.S. Africa Command views security and access to Djibouti as a top priority,”  Waldhauser told members of Congress in March 2018. “Consequently, we continue to monitor this [Chinese] development to ensure U.S. interests are not deterred.” It seems that that Chinese may be exploring doing just that with its lasers and overall, it would seem to be in line with China’s other increasingly assertive foreign policy decisions. At the same time, unlike their expanding presence in places such as the South China Sea, the blinding lasers run a far greater risk of causing a serious injury, or even a fatality, if they cause a plane or helicopter to crash. It remains to be seen how the Chinese will respond now that the U.S. government has formally censured them and whether they will continue with the laser harassment or seek new ways to challenge the United States in Djibouti and elsewhere.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are still coming in, but a WC-130 Hercules hurricane hunter from the Puerto Rico Air National Guard’s 156th Airlift Wing has crashed in Savannah, Georgia shortly after 11:00 AM, Eastern Standard Time. Initial pictures and video show the tail section largely intact, but a massive fire producing a tower of thick, black smoke. According to the Chatham County Emergency Management Agency, or CEMA , the plane crashed and burned right in the middle of a built-up area, coming to rest at the intersection of Savannah’s Crossgate Road and Georgia State Route 21, forcing authorities to close off portions of the roads. First responders were on the scene, but state and Air National Guard officials did not initially have any word on casualties among either the crew or anyone on the ground. The crash site is less than five miles from Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, which is home to the Georgia Air National Guard’s 165th Airlift Wing. Initial reports that the aircraft was a C-130H airlifter belonging to that unit appear to have been in error, with officials confirming to Defense News that the Hercules belonged to the 156th Airlift Wing. There have already been more than a half dozen U.S. military aviation accidents in 2018, both within the United States and abroad, resulting in more than a dozen fatalities. Most recently, on April 24, 2018 , a U.S. Air Force F-16C Viper fighter jet from the 56th Fighter Wing crashed near Lake Havasu City Municipal Airport in Arizona. Earlier in April, an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter had ended up on its belly at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. Thankfully the pilots were able to walk away in both of those cases. Still, this latest incident only adds to the evidence that the U.S. military as a whole is increasingly facing a readiness crisis across its aviation elements. Update: 1:50pm EST— According to a press release the Georgia Air National Guard, which is assisting in the response to the crash, sent to various outlets , there were five individuals aboard the WC-130H. Their status remains unclear, but the statement did say that “the names will be released upon notification of next-of-kin.” A separate Tweet from the National Guard Bureau also confirmed that aircraft had a crew of five, but did not offer any additional details about their fate. Local reports say that the Chatham County Deputy Coroner said two people had died in the crash, but it is not clear whether or not those were individuals on board the aircraft or on the ground. Update: 2:00pm EST— There are additional images of the crash site that show there is indeed almost nothing left of the aircraft besides the tail section. The pictures also help confirm that this aircraft is serial 65-0968, a WC-130H hurricane hunter. It originally started life as an HC-130H rescue aircraft. Update: 2:20pm EST— It is interesting to note that during his visit to Puerto Rico in October 2017 in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, U.S. President Donald Trump sat under this exact same WC-130H during a meeting about the disaster response efforts. You can see the last four digits of the serial, 0968, clearly on the aircraft’s nose in the picture below.

It is important to note that these details could still change as more information becomes available. They also said that the five individuals on board had died, which officials have not yet confirmed. However, U.S. Air Force Capt. Jeffrey Bezore, a 165th Airlift Wing spokesperson, did, unfortunately, tell Stars and Stripes that the crews were presumed to be dead. Update: 5:00pm EST— Authorities have now confirmed that a least five people have died as a result of the crash, which would likely be the plane’s entire crew. It remains unclear whether or not anyone on the ground suffered any injuries as a result of the mishap. A new video has also emerged, showing the aircraft slowly banking to left before spinning out of control and plummeting into the ground. Update: 5/3/2018 — Authorities have now confirmed that a total of nine people on board WC-130H serial number 65-0698 died in the crash, as well as the detail that the plane was heading for retirement at the Bone Yard. In addition, the Puerto Rico Air National Guard has said that it has two more WC-130Hs that are non-flyable due to a maintenance backlog.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Let’s Talk About This Rumor That Israeli F-15s Mimicked US Jets To Strike At Iran In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Days after an intense volley of strikes targeting Iran’s military activities in Syria, new information about the Israeli operation continues to trickle out, though many details remain uncertain. Now, a new rumor has emerged on social media claiming that Israel’s F-15I Ra’am multi-role combat aircraft were able to get close to their targets without raising the alarm by using the same transponder codes as U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles and taking a circuitous route through Jordan and Iraq. According to a report from NBC News on May 1, 2018, three U.S. officials, all speaking anonymously, confirmed that Israeli F-15Is had taken part in the mission on April 29, 2018. Based on earlier reports, those aircraft struck various targets in northwestern Syria, but focused their attention mainly on Iranian and Iranian-backed forces within the Syrian Arab Army’s 47th Brigade base near Hama. The strikes leveled more than a dozen buildings and reportedly destroyed hundreds of unspecified missiles, among other weapons and equipment. The U.S. sources told NBC that operation left two dozen personnel at the base dead and another three dozen wounded, which is close to the body count in initial reports from the independent U.K.-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. How the jets were able to get to their targets and not prompt any significant response from Syrian air defense forces remains unclear. Unlike what has been the case after numerous previous strikes, the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad did not claim to have shot down any of the Israeli weapons and there was no readily available footage of surface-to-air missiles speeding toward possible targets in the night. Even more pertinent to this question is that the Israeli aircraft reportedly employed GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs in addition to Delilah stand-off missiles . The 250-pound class GPS-guided glide bombs have a maximum range of a little more than 60 miles when an aircraft releases them from high altitude.  This would have required the F-15Is to enter Syria’s airspace, at least for some amount of time and the aircraft would likely have appeared on Syrian radars – or Russian ones that are supposedly linked to the government’s air defense network – before then. One unconfirmed rumor explains that the Israeli jets masked their approach by setting their Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponders to emit the same type of signal associated with U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles, as well as using false callsigns to help keep up the ruse. These jets routinely conduct operations in Eastern Syria in support of American forces and their local partners . The presence of Strike Eagles would not necessarily have aroused suspicions if they appeared on Syrian or Russian radars while over Eastern Syria. Israel’s aircraft then supposedly flew through Jordan, Iraq, and into Eastern Syria before blitzing toward their targets. The strike package then reportedly refueled over Iraq and then returned to Israel via Jordan. It’s certainly one possible explanation, but it also raises a number of significant questions. If the aircraft had masked themselves as F-15Es flying through Jordan and Iraq, they would almost certainly have had to do so with the active support of the former of those countries and the United States in order to avoid any potential confusion that could’ve exposed the entire ruse. American personnel, in particular, are likely on something of a heightened alert for anything out of the ordinary given reports of regular electronic warfare attacks on U.S. manned and unmanned aircraft in Eastern Syria, too. It is definitely possible that the U.S. military may be taking an increasingly active role in these operations. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have formed an especially close relationship with Israel , even pledging to move the U.S. embassy in the country to the country’s disputed capital Jerusalem . Even then that might not be enough. Though Iraqi radar coverage is spotty along the Syrian border, U.S. Air Force and NATO E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft and other coalition ground-based radar assets are helping coordinate air operations against ISIS. It’s hard to imagine that four F-15Is would have been able to slip through unmolested, let alone take time to refuel using an Israeli Air Force tanker. It is not clear that the United States would have been able to convince even Jordan or Iraq to necessarily acquiesce to the plan. Though a staunch ally of the United States and traditional partner of Israel’s , Jordan only recently ended a major diplomatic spat with the country over the deaths of two Jordanian nationals outside the Israeli Embassy in Amman in 2017. It’s not at all certain if relations have improved in the interceding weeks to a place where the two might conspire on convert military action. Iraq, which maintains diplomatic and military ties with Russia, Iran, and Syria , seems even less likely to have agreed to such a plan. If they did not consent to the operation, Iraqi officials could easily have decided to pass along any advance warning of the strikes to the Assad regime. The Israeli aircraft could have obviated the need for tanker support by skipping the Iraq part of the run, instead cutting through southern Syria near the U.S. military’s At Tanf garrison , where American aircraft routinely patrol. This still would have involved flying through Jordanian airspace, though. Israeli F-15Cs refuel from a KC-707 tanker., IAF All told, it’s hard to see all these pieces aligning for the Israeli operation to go off without any issues whatsoever. In addition, Israel could simply have released SDBs at targets in Hama at least from near the Lebanese-Syrian border, a common tactic seen in multiple previous strikes , which has largely shielded the aircraft from retaliation. The Israeli jets could have similarly briefly violated Turkish airspace at supersonic speed to do the same against Syria’s Nairab Military Airport in Aleppo. In 2007, F-15Is and F-16Is flew through Turkey on their way to destroy Syria’s covert nuclear reactor in the eastern Deir ez-Zor governorate. Of course, using such a route in the April 29, 2018 strikes could have carried its own risks given the Turkish Government’s growing relations with Russia and Iran and its very public disputes with the United States and its coalition fighting ISIS. Turkey has shot down Russian and Syrian aircraft that have strayed into its airspace since 2014. Another possibility to explain the apparent lack of activity from Syrian air defenses is that they suffered some sort of electronic warfare or cyber attacks ahead of or during the operation. During a separate reported incident on the night of April 16-17, 2018, there were claims that the United States and Israel had launched a combined, non-kinetic assault on targets in Syria. At the time, this seemed odd, since there were no reported strikes associated with the incident and it seemed unlikely that Israel would employ these countermeasures by themselves. It was possible that electronic or cyber attacks were part of previous intelligence or reconnaissance mission or were a dry run to test out advanced countermeasures ahead of just such a real strike. It’s also worth noting that Israel reportedly employed a computer program called Suter to misdirect Syrian radars and clear a path during the aforementioned strike in Deir ez-Zor in 2007. Israeli Air Force F-15I Ra’am multi-role combat jets., IAF There have also been rumors in the past that Israel’s F-35I stealth fighters have taken part in previous strikes. Though those earlier reports seemed unlikely, these jets would have been able to pierce through Syria’s air defense network to drop SDBs onto the targets with a low likelihood of detection. It’s also entirely possible that Syrian air defenses just remain largely ineffective in responding to aerial attacks. In February 2018, Syria’s forces did bring down an Israeli F-16I multi-role combat jet, but this is the only kill they’ve scored against a manned aircraft in some 18 months of Israeli air strikes. They only reportedly managed to fire two surface-to-air missiles during the massive U.S.-led missile barrage against Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure on April 14, 2018, lobbing dozens more into the empty sky afterward. However Israeli aircraft were able to pull off the strike, the Israeli government has made abundantly clear it continues to be willing to strike at Iran and its interests in Syria. The country’s officials have made it clear that they view growing Iranian military activities and influence in Syria, as well as expanding support for its proxies, such as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as threats worth neutralizing despite increasing risks. “On the list of the potentials for most likely live hostility around the world, the battle between Israel and Iran in Syria is at the top of the list right now,” one of NBC’s anonymous senior U.S. sources said. We at The War Zone have come to much the same conclusion after observing the steadily increasing volume and the changing focus of Israeli strikes into Syria. Whether it is doing so with greater direct support from the United States or not, Israel looks determined to keep up the pressure on Iran and it seems almost certain that we will continue to see more aerial raids in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Dec 14, 2018",US Special Operators Scattered Across Yemen Might Soon Rely On Contractors To Rescue Them,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Pentagon is interested in having contractors provide two fixed-wing aircraft and two helicopters on call to rescue wounded American special operators in and around Yemen if necessary, as well as to perform various other missions. The announcement comes as it becomes increasingly clear that the U.S. military’s own aerial casualty evacuation capabilities are stretched thin and just months after it weathered serious criticism over relying heavily on private companies for these services following a deadly ambush in Niger . U.S. Transportation Command, acting on behalf of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia, posted the notice on FedBizOpps, the U.S. government’s main contracting website, on April 30, 2018. The draft documents say the basic requirements are for the four contractor-operated aircraft to provide casualty and medical evacuation, personnel recovery, and passenger and cargo services. American special operators publicly returned to Yemen in 2016 after a brief absence, ostensibly to support operations against Al Qaeda- and ISIS-linked terrorists. The new element, known officially as Special Operations Command (Forward) Yemen, is the one the contract announcement specifically names as needing the aviation support. Additional special operations forces have made short-duration raids into the country, as well. The U.S. military has been actively engaged in various counter-terrorism and related training missions in the country since at least 2009 . In 2015, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition repeatedly intervened in the country to halt the rise of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels , but American personnel on the ground at present are not supposed to be engaged in any operations together with those forces. A US Army soldier guards a Columbia Helicopters Vertol 107-II helicopter during a training exercise in Afghanistan., US Army Casualty evacuation and more The April 2018 contract notice says U.S. special operators in the country are now in need of fixed-wing aircraft that can take off and land on runways as short as 3,000 feet, or even less and possibly at night with the crew having to use night vision goggles. The planes may need to “hot refuel” with the engines still running at forward locations. Though the contracting notice doesn’t specify any particular types of aircraft, the fixed-wing types have to be able to fly at least 500 miles without refueling while carrying up to eight passengers or as much as 4,000 pounds of cargo. The contract would have to supply trained medical personnel, as well, to be able to render aid immediately and throughout the flight, presumably as the aircraft flew onward to a location with a more robust medical facility. The basic requirements for the two categories of aircraft in the draft contracting documents., TRANSCOM The two helicopters, also with crews capable of night vision goggle operations at night, would need to have unrefueled ranges of a minimum of 400 miles, also while transporting as many as eight individuals or 3,500 pounds of cargo. In addition to emergency medical technicians to see to wounded personnel throughout the operation, the helicopters would also need to be able to hoist personnel or other items over water or in rugged, mountainous terrain, the latter being referred to as “high angle” recoveries. The crews of both the fixed-wing planes and the helicopters need to mobilize within 30 minutes of receiving a notification from U.S. Central Command. Having two of each aircraft type is specifically to allow for one to be fully mission capable at all times, with an alternate in case of unforeseen issues. However, there is no stated requirement, at least in the draft documentation, about how quickly they aircraft need to be able to get to the specified location or complete the mission. Emergency medical professionals generally aim to get injured individuals to the next level of care within the “ golden hour .” Though there is some debate about whether a firm 60-minute window makes a difference, it goes without saying that the faster a person with serious, potentially life-threatening injuries can get into a proper medical facility, the better chance they have of making a full recovery. A contractor-operated Sikorsky S-61R helicopter belonging to EP Aviation, a subsidiary of AAR Airlift Group, in Afghanistan in 2015., US Air Force A large operating area The contracting notice does not say where the U.S. government would base the planes and helicopters and their crews, but identifies a host of potential sites in Bahrain, Djibouti, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. military defines all of these as within “Yemen Area of Responsibility,” or Yemen AOR. A list of airports and air bases that contractors could have to operate from in support of operations in Yemen., TRANSCOM The full list in the documents includes, but is not limited to, major American hubs in the region such as Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport in Djibouti – which hosts Camp Lemonnier, the U.S. military’s only formal base in Africa – Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait, and Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Djibouti, which has long served as an American staging ground for operations in Yemen, seems the most likely “home base,” especially given references in the contract documentation to U.S. Africa Command, which oversees operations in that country. A map showing the various locations identified within the contracting documents, a broad area the US military refers to as the Yemen AOR., Google Maps/The War Zone Still, the aircraft would likely make routine use of more forward operating sites situated nearer to the Yemeni border, where the aircraft could stage ahead of planned, short-duration operations or at times when it is otherwise apparent that there are greater risks to American troops. The specified range requirements are otherwise not enough for the aircraft to reach sites in Yemen from many of the designated larger facilities elsewhere in and around the Arabian Peninsula. The documentation also identifies 10 specific locations within Yemen, which the U.S. military defines as the “Yemen Joint Special Operations Area,” or Yemen JSOA. These include sites across the country, including the capital Sana’a, the port city of Aden, and the heavily contested city of Hodeidah , also written Al Hudaydah, on the Red Sea, the last of which remains largely under the control of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. A close-up map showing the 10 separate locations in Yemen, as well as sites just over the border in Saudi Arabia to the North, Oman to the east, and Djoubti to the southwest. , Google Maps/The War Zone However, it’s not clear how much coverage four aircraft of any type might be necessarily able to provide across such a wide area. From the draft documentation, it appears clear that the contractors’ primary role would be casualty and medical evacuation, potentially rushing to save seriously wounded individuals. But this mission set, especially, requires good positioning and rapid response to be truly effective. These same issues were at the core of major criticisms about the U.S. military’s response, or lack thereof, to the infamous ambush of American and Nigerien troops in Niger in October 2017 . French multi-role combat jets and gunship and transport helicopters were the first air support elements to arrive on scene during that skirmish, which left four U.S. personnel dead. Contractors, working for U.S. Africa Command and situated in the country’s capital Niamey, who were similarly charged with casualty evacuation and personnel recovery missions, only arrived after the fighting had stopped to recover the bodies. No other U.S. military combat aircraft or combat search and rescue elements were in the country, let alone readily available. A low-quality image of a DHC-6 Twin Otter belonging to Berry Aviation, which is under US military contract to provide personnel recovery and casualty evacuation services in Niger, at an undisclosed location., Berry Aviation A multi-faceted conflict Unlike Niger, where militant groups typically engage in more limited attacks, Yemen is in the midst of a brutal civil war combined with an equally grueling and controversial Saudi-led intervention . Despite their official focus on Al Qaeda- and ISIS-affiliated terrorists, there is a significant risk that U.S. special operations forces could end up drawn into the country’s broader conflict. That the Yemen JSOA apparently contains locations such as Hodeidah, which sits in an area with a heavy Houthi presence, calls into question just how practical it might be for American forces to avoid the Saudi-run campaign, regardless of their stated mission. If nothing else, it indicates that U.S. personnel are coordinating with the Saudis and their partners to a significant degree, otherwise there would be a serious danger of the two sets of operations conflicting with each other. The operating area also prompts questions about whether the U.S. military mission in Yemen is as limited or distinct from the Saudi-led efforts as officials have made it out to be in the past. As of December 2017, the Pentagon said it had a grand total of five personnel in the country, which seems extremely dubious given the apparent breath of the JSOA. Renewed questions about the true nature and purpose of America’s involvement in Yemen, especially after a controversial raid in January 2017 left a U.S. Navy SEAL and a number of innocent civilians dead, have prompted challenges from advocacy groups and legislators in the past 18 months. Just recently, though, in March 2018, the U.S. Senate rejected a bill that would have ended indirect American support for the Saudi Arabian effort. A United Arab Emirates F-16E Desert Falcon fighter jet links up with a US Air Force aerial refueling tanker on its way to strike ISIS targets in Iraq in 2016., USAF With American aerial refueling tankers supporting the Saudi-led coalition, and past U.S. military intelligence and logistics support for the intervention, Houthi rebels have long made it clear that they see little distinction between the two parties anyway. In 2017, U.S. Central Command conceded that it could not accurately say how much fuel its aircraft were dispensing to the Saudis and their partners in mid-air. Driving home the point, they attacked multiple American warships in the Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden in 2016 and shot down a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in 2017. The attacks on U.S. Navy ships provoked an American cruise missile strike on Houthi positions in response. Since then, the Houthis have only improved their air defense capabilities with both locally improvised infrared surface-to-air missile systems and reported deliveries of production-quality radar-guided types from Iran . That threat, perhaps more than anything else, might limit the ability of contractor aircraft to safely and reliability conduct their missions without some sort military escort. Any company performing this work would need prior approval to arm their aircraft in any way, though there are no restrictions on other self-defense systems such as radar warning receivers and infrared decoy flares, according to the contract documents. Still, without any weapons on the aircraft, especially the helicopters, it’s hard to imagine that they would be able to fly into anything approaching a hostile area to rescue anyone under fire, inherently slowing their ability to respond. The Houthis released the video below in March 2018, which they say shows them attempting to shoot down a pair of United Arab Emirates F-16 Viper fighter jets. https://youtube.com/watch?v=waUHC5h-Nb4 Limited resources Despite the obvious potential issues with the arrangement, the U.S. military might feel it has few other options than to turn to contractors for supplemental casualty evacuation and other aerial support capabilities. Combat search and rescue assets, both fixed and rotary wing types, are limited in number in general, but also in high demand around the world. But with relatively few available U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawks to go around American commanders in Afghanistan decided to pair the service’s rescue personnel with U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters instead in 2017 . The Air Force does have Pave Hawks forward deployed to Djibouti that are within range of parts of Yemen, but those aircraft are already tasked to provide support across much of East Africa . The video below shows U.S. Air Force HH-60Gs based in Djibouti training with other U.S. military services for over-water rescue missions. There are serious questions about how suitable the HH-60Gs, aging aircraft that are already in desperate need of replacement , are for operations in hot-and-high environments, exactly like those in many parts of Yemen, as well. Air Force personnel in Afghanistan said using the Army’s more powerful CH-47s gave them the ability to perform missions that they simply could not have done with their HH-60Gs. Other services are also having trouble generating the required aviation elements for various missions due to a variety of factors, including pilot shortages and maintenance and sustainability issues . For example, Chinooks are so highly sought after , the Army is in the process of looking into whether it might be able to create additional CH-47 companies to help reduce the strain on existing units. Members of the US Air Force’s 83rd Rescue Squadron board a US Army CH-47 during a training mission in Afghanistan. , USAF Helicopters remain the primary asset for combat search and rescue operations, owing in no small part to their ability to extract personnel from remote areas with only small available landing zones. However, U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 and Air Force CV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors are steadily becoming a better option. With greater speed and range than many helicopters, these aircraft could potentially be more flexible, able to respond to crises much further away from their home bases. That speed would make them less of a target for enemies on the ground too. U.S. Marine Corps Osprey crews train to perform combat search and rescue missions, which they refer to as  Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP), from both bases on land and U.S. Navy amphibious ships. They have supported operations in Iraq and Syria in this capacity and another specialized task force is on call for similar missions in Africa . Air Force CV-22s also prepare for casualty evacuation missions, but are generally dedicated to supporting special operations forces specifically. Unfortunately, while taking off or landing vertically, the Osprey presents much the same target as a helicopter. In 2013, three Air Force CV-22s suffered significant damage while attempting to conduct a non-combatant evacuation operation in South Sudan. A U.S. Navy SEAL on board one of the aircraft nearly died . And the V-22 fleets are expensive to operate and maintenance heavy . Combined with the desire within both the Marines and Air Force to focus more on using the aircraft’s unique capabilities for air assaults, amphibious operations, raids, other special operations missions, commanders have often been reluctant to give them up for lower profile missions. The crew aboard a US Air Force CV-22 Osprey hoists a special operator aboard during a training exercise., USAF Something rather than nothing All of these issues and more have continually pushed the U.S. military as a whole to pursue contractors to provide support in often remote and austere locations. And some capability is better than no capability at all. “You’re never going to have the golden hour in Africa; it’s not possible,” retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Donald Bolduc, who was last in charge of Special Operations Command Africa, told The New York Times in the aftermath of the ambush in Niger. “But you have an acceptable amount of time that commanders have agreed on.” As such, private airlift continues to be a critical part of American military activities, especially across Africa, as well in support of other so-called “small footprint” operations elsewhere. In many of those cases, there is also a distinct desire to keep a low profile, for operational security and political reasons , which effectively precludes the deployment of a larger military force.

U.S. personnel are in that country at present helping government forces tackle ISIS-aligned terrorists as part of Operation Pacific Eagle. Other U.S. government agencies are increasingly turning to contractors for many of the same reasons. The U.S. State Department uses private firms to run “Embassy Air” shuttle flights in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a long history of using legitimate businesses and front companies for covert activities, too. We’ve spotted them flying transport helicopters and intelligence gathering aircraft for other unknown agencies. A State Department contractor-operated “Embassy Air” CH-46 helicopter., US Army In 2015, shadowy Sikorsky S-92 helicopters appeared in Djibouti , which they might have been supporting earlier operations in Yemen, as well. In 2017, The New York Times reported that the U.S. government had snuck in supply shipments for secretive special operations forces in Yemen with humanitarian aid deliveries aboard contractor cargo aircraft . The concern, of course, remains that American special operators in Yemen will have an increasingly difficult time keeping their presence limited and separate from the broader conflict. If they find themselves caught in a larger skirmish – or even a small, but fierce one such as the incident in Niger – the contractor-operated rescue planes and helicopters might just not cut it, especially if those aircraft can’t defend themselves.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 4, 2018",Marines Want Contractor-Flown Russian Mi-24 Hind Helicopter Gunships At More Exercises,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is looking into whether a contractor might be able to supply Mi-24 Hind gunship or Mi-17 Hip armed transport helicopters to add extra realism to various exercises. Outside companies routinely provide these types of helicopters to play mock enemies at a number of U.S. military training events, but this kind of “adversary” support could become even more relevant as American forces across the services refocus on preparing for high-end conflicts against “great power” opponents, such as Russia . On April 26, 2018, the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, or MAGTFTC, posted a draft set of requirements on the U.S. government’s main contracting website, FedBizOpps, with the goal of determining whether there were any vendors who might be able to provide the desired training support. The draft documents call for two Mi-24 or Mi-17 helicopters to be available for at least five Integrated Training Exercises (ITX) annually at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, or MCAGCC , in Twentynine Palms, California. The proposed contract would include an option for the Marines to send those aircraft to five Mountain Training Exercises (MTX) at the Mountain Warfare Training Center near Bridgeport, California, as well as two Talon Exercises (TALONEX), one each at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona and Twentynine Palms. The TALONEXs occur concurrently with Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course capstone exercises. The Russian-made Mi-24 and Mi-17 are extremely popular among military and paramilitary forces around the world, large and small, and are among the most likely hostile helicopters Marines might face in any real-world conflict. The massive Hind also has an often overlooked secondary troop-carrying capability in addition to its array of forward-firing machine guns, automatic cannons, rockets, and anti-tank missiles, making it a potentially more complex threat. There is an additional potential option for the contractor to provide a single An-2 Colt biplane – an obsolete, but still potentially dangerous platform you can read about more in depth here – for the pair of TALONEXs, as well. The business end of a contractor-operated Mi-24 Hind at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma during WTI Course 1-16 in 2016., USMC “The attack helicopter will act as an aggressor to interfere with the exercises forces conducting offensive, defensive and stability operations,” the notice said. “This will include potential use during friendly aviation operations in order to force decision making.” Each ITX is an important part of battalion- and squadron-level activities for units ahead of a deployment as part of a Marine Air Ground Task Force, or MAGTF, such as a Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked on board a group of U.S. Navy amphibious ships. The more than four-week long event consists largely of live-fire training exercises that combine both air and ground elements and include scenarios in simulated urban environments, according to the draft contracting documents. US Air Force Special Operators train with a Mi-17., USAF MTXs, which are one day shorter than ITXs, are similar in scope, but occur at the Mountain Warfare Training Center under both high altitude and cold weather conditions. The five-week long TALONEXs are part of the seven-week long WTI course, which pushes aviators in specifically to demonstrate their mastery of combat aviation, tactics application, and battle planning. “In order to capitalize on all the capabilities that [Marine Corps aviation] has, you have to bring everyone together in one location and plan and execute together,” U.S. Marine Corps Major Brett McGregor explained after graduating from WTI Course 2-14 in 2014. “As a student, it is not a test to see how good they are at flying their aircraft, it’s a test to see how well you can fight with the MAGTF as a whole; how well you can fit into the team and be effective from the bigger picture.” American and Estonia special operators train with an Estonian Air Force An-2 biplane in 2014., US Army It’s no surprise the Marine Corps wants these exercises to be as realistic as possible in order to both prepare Marines for potential real-world combat situations and to provide an accurate assessment of their skills. The so-called “opposing force,” or OPFOR, is critical to providing this experience. And private “red air” adversaries have been gaining traction as useful and cost-effective dissimilar opponents for aerial warfare exercises for some time and it makes sense to employ similar aggressors for air-and-ground training, too. Contractor-operated Mi-24s and Mi-17s , such as Hinds from VTS Aviation in Tacoma, Washington, have made regular appearances at WTI Course events, among other training exercises, for more than a decade for exactly this reason. Having this kind of support on call for more routine exercises can only help improve the quality of training across the Corps. One of VTS Aviation’s Hinds, which have already provided adversary support to the US military in the past., VTS Aviation According to the requirements outlined in the draft contract documents, the contractor-flown helicopters would provide a realistic threat, or at least an operational hazard, to friendly fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft in flight or at forward operating sites or refueling and rearming points , as well as ground troops and air defense personnel across the simulated battlefield. Specifically, the helicopters would perform close air support for the OPFOR components on the ground and launch independent attacks on friendly forces, as well as scout and otherwise gathering intelligence on their movements. The adversary aircraft need to be able to carry standard AN/ASQ-T50(V)2 tracking pods so that they can register “hits” on and from friendly forces. The contractors also need to be subject matter experts who can explain the various features of the aircraft in detailing to the exercise participants, as well as providing instructional flights to interested individuals. Of course, almost any helicopter can act as a surrogate threat to at least some degree and various U.S. military training centers employ existing American types often with minor modifications and new “enemy” paint schemes in the OPFOR role. Much like the stand-ins in a Hollywood movie, some of these are better than others. UH-72A Lakotas fulfill this role at many U.S. Army facilities, such Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Germany, but do little to truly replicate the sight and sound of potential enemy aircraft. Bulgarian soldiers load a simulated casualty onto a US Army UH-72A Lakota helicopter wearing an unusual at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Germany., US Army But there’s immense value in being able to train against a mock opponent flying a representative aircraft with its unique performance capabilities and limitations and electromagnetic, infrared, acoustic, and visual signatures. How certain aircraft show up on various sensors is especially important for improving realism, especially when training air defense teams. Staring down a massive Russian Hind in training might help reduce any anxiety or other “ buck fever ” when facing off against the real thing in combat, too. “The attack helicopter, due to its size, flight profile, firepower and defensive maneuvering capabilities, constitutes a unique threat creating a realistic, dissimilar and credible Opposing Force (OPFOR) to stress the joint forces conducting Joint Air and Missile Defense Operations,” the draft contract notice stated. An Afghan Air Force Mi-35, the export designation for the Mi-24, prepares for a mission in 2011., USAF As noted, the Mi-24 and Mi-17 are among the most proliferated armed helicopters in the world, which makes it likely that Marines might encounter them in a variety of conflict situations, both as hostile and friendly assets . Training to fight against them, though, is likely to be increasingly important in light of a U.S.-military wide push to reorient training to focus on fighting larger scale conventional opponents after years of the dominant concern being low-intensity conflicts involving terrorists and other militants. Immediately after the end of the Cold War, the perception was that the threat of enemy airpower to American forces had largely evaporated. This view has steadily reversed in recent years. There is now an increasing view that the U.S. military may not be universally assured to have air superiority in future conflicts. This has become especially pronounced after multiple air-to-air engagements over Syria against manned and unmanned aircraft that were threatening American forces. The Syrian government and Russian forces in the country also regularly fly Mi-24s and Mi-17s. Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit fire a Stinger trainer missile from the deck of the Wasp -class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima , USMC The need for U.S. military forces to reemphasize training to employ short-range air defenses against low-flying aircraft and helicopters, and make sure air defense weapons actually exist to perform that function, in particular, has become a major issue. It has similarly become important again to make sure other ground know how to respond to hostile attack helicopters or enemy air assault forces, or even opposing special operators trying to infiltrate behind the front lines in an old An-2. And for a MAGTF’s air component, low- and slow-flying helicopters can also present a particularly challenging threat for both fast-moving jets and other helicopters to respond to, making real enemy type helicopters especially valuable targets to have at the various exercises. Having Mi-24s or Mi-17s at routine ITX, as well as other exercises such as the MTXs and TALONEXs, can only give Marines a better opportunity to train against realistic threats. It’s definitely better for Marines to get as much experience as they can against these potential threats in training than have an enemy catch them completely off guard in an actual conflict.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 19, 2018","No, The Su-57 Isn’t ‘Junk:’ Six Features We like On Russia’s New Fighter","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia’s 5th generation fighter aircraft, formerly known as the T-50 and now officially named the Su-57, has been in the news a lot lately. India’s decision to finally walk away from the joint program could be a catastrophic blow to the jet’s future, which followed an abortive deployment to war-torn Syria late last February. Russia’s inability to afford decent sized production lots of the new jets and the aircraft’s ongoing engine saga also have taken their toll on the program. And above all else, the aircraft’s degree of low-observability (stealthiness) has long been in question, as it lacked many of the key features that define modern stealth fighters. But none of this conclusively means the Su-57 doesn’t have some redeemable qualities and features that are worth pointing out. To some degree, the T-50/Su-57 is a misunderstood aircraft. The jet’s lack of high-end low-observable design features doesn’t mean it is irrelevant or even ineffective. Sukhoi designers have taken a ‘balanced’ approach to low-observability, whereby the aircraft’s reduced radar signature from certain aspects becomes just another feature to be weighed against other design priorities. This very well may have been a necessity due to lack of stealthy materials science, manufacturing, and design expertise, but none-the-less the outcome is the same. https://youtube.com/watch?v=kc8RySHLIkU I have discussed how standoff weaponry has come into play in this equation as well, but other features have also been designed into the airframe with an apparent self-awareness of the fact that the aircraft will not be able to compete with U.S or even Chinese counterparts in terms of stealth alone. And considering how Russia’s armed forces are organized and the battle doctrine behind that organization, being able to pierce deep into the most sophisticated integrated air defense networks during some sort of expeditionary operation isn’t a top priority anyway. I get asked a lot about the Su-57s level of ‘stealth’ in comparison to other fighter aircraft. From years of looking into this, and talking with countless people in the defense-aerospace field about their thoughts on the design, I would handicap the Su-57 as something between an International Roadmap Super Hornet or Silent Eagle and China’s J-20, with it being closer to the former than the latter. But once again, stealth is just one ingredient of a complex cocktail that makes up an advanced fighter’s overall capabilities set and ability to survive in various combat situations. With all this in mind, here are five features we like on the Su-57, some of which are tailored to help overcome its lack of extreme signature reduction, at least to a certain degree. Side Facing Cheek-Mounted Radars The Su-57 has a feature that was long-promised for the F-22 but as of yet, has never been delivered—side-facing radars mounted below the cockpit on aircraft’s ‘cheeks.’ These active electronically scanned array (AESA) X-band radars supplement the aircraft primarily nose-mounted X-band N036 Byelka (Squirrel) AESA radar. Supposedly these secondary radars have roughly a third of the transmit-receive modules as the jet’s main radar. You can clearly see the side radar aperture below the ‘chine line’ under the aerial refueling probe. , Russian Embassy Twitter At first glance, the utility of these radars is clear—they provide a far greater sensor field of view and thus enhance situational awareness for the Su-57’s pilot. But beyond this the most basic of advantages, they allow the Su-57 pilot to execute a key tactic better than nearly any other fighter around. This tactic is usually referred to as “beaming.” Beaming is when a fighter turns 90 degrees away (perpendicular) to an enemy’s pulse doppler radar array. Because these types of radars use doppler shift to gauge a target’s relative velocity, and as such, they filter low relative velocity objects, like ground clutter, the beaming fighter, which is not moving towards or away from the enemy radar much, can enter the enemy radar’s ‘doppler notch.’ This blind spot is where the radar’s velocity gate, which acts like a filter, sees a target at low enough relative motion from its perspective that it discounts it. So even though the enemy fighter may be moving at 500 mph, the right angle to the radar makes it only detect small amounts of closure. As a result, it throws this information out as it would a mountaintop. This is an especially useful tactic when the radar is positioned at a higher altitude than the beaming aircraft, and trying to lock up its target in a look-down-shoot-down scenario where ground clutter is prevalent. The issue is that with a typically fixed AESA radar or mechanically scanned array, pulling off a beaming maneuver means the fighter doing so will lose its radar picture of the enemy it is trying to evade. Without third-party sensors feeding this data to the beaming fighter via data-link, its pilot will become blind to the tactical situation when it matters most. But what’s worse is that any radar-guided missiles that have been fired from the now beaming fighter will not be able to receive mid-course updates, and thus those missiles’ probability of kill will plummet, especially if fired off initially at long-range. So fighters without cheek arrays, or novel swashplate like designs like those found on SAAB’s JAS-39E/F Gripen and eventually on the Typhoon, and absence of engagement quality tracks provided by third-party sensors via data-link, the launching fighter will either have to take a more acute and less effective beaming angle in order to continue to update their missiles with their radar, or they will have to forget about updating them altogether. Advanced AESA radars that are highly sensitive and run complex software have lessened the impact of beaming as a tactic to a limited degree. But it is still considered relevant, especially against opponents without high-end networking and surveillance support capabilities. Considering the Su-57s lack of advanced stealth, you can see why having dedicated cheek arrays can be very useful as it can lower its detectability using extreme beaming tactics, especially at long ranges, while still actively guiding its missiles to its target. Once again, advanced networking capabilities, especially those used by the U.S. and its allies, can lessen the effectiveness of beaming and notching in a densely surveilled battlespace that includes the presence of airborne early warning aircraft, surface and ground-based radars, and other fighter aircraft all feeding their information into a common picture that is distributed via data-link. But Russia doesn’t benefit from this level of dynamic connectivity, nor do many of its potential adversaries. So including cheek mounted arrays on the Su-57 so that it can maintain situational awareness and targeting capabilities while beaming without external help makes a lot of sense. The Su-57 is also said to incorporate L-band radar arrays blended inside its large maneuvering leading edge extensions. These radars are more for target discrimination and identification than anything else. The aircraft also has another X-band radar array in its ‘stinger’ tail for enhanced situational awareness, and possibly for future targeting with extremely agile ‘lock-on after launch’ missiles as well. Su-57’s tail-mounted radar. Also notice the sizeable weapons bay gap., Youtube Video Screencap It’s also worth noting that AESA arrays can also be used to execute pinpoint electronic attacks. Theoretically, a fighter’s radar system could employ these electronic warfare tactics while attacking another aircraft, or while under attack. Being able to do so even at oblique angles without changing nose position could be beneficial, as well. With that in mind, the Su-57 could be a powerful electronic warfare tool, if not today, then possibly the future. It’s worth noting that even while beaming, putting out any radar energy could potentially give away your position. But the Su-57 has a solution for that as well. Infrared Search and Track The Su-57 sports an advanced 101KS ‘Atoll’ infrared search and track sensor in the traditional position on Russian fighters—installed atop the aircraft’s nose, near its windscreen. Although this placement clearly hurts the Su-57s radar signature where it matters most—in the forward hemisphere—an IRST is among the best technologies available for detecting and engaging stealth targets from afar. I recommend you read all about IRSTs and how they are used in air combat in this past feature of mine to get a healthier understanding of the unique capabilities they bring to an aerial fight. An IRST can also be used to provide targeting information to a fighter’s missiles in-flight, even while that jet is beaming. Above all else it allows the Su-57 to operate and persecute targets while staying electromagnetically silent (giving off no radio emissions), which is just as big of a deal these days as being hard to detect on radar. It also is immune to the effects of electronic warfare. Modern combat aircraft have the ability to detect, classifying, and even geolocate enemy emissions. Low probability of intercept (LPI) radar modes can drastically help with remaining untrackable while still giving off some emissions, but LPI is a broad term and not all aircraft with LPI radars have the same abilities to stay undetected while also actively using those radars in combat situations. The Su-57’s 101KS-V IRST is mounted where it is found traditionally on Russia fighters and not the best spot for low observability. The ball does rotate rearwards in when not in use., UAC Russia But an infrared search and track system can allow for creative tactics to be used as well that can surprise the enemy and exploit holes in their game plans. But once again, above all else, it gives the Su-57 some capability to detect and even engage the stealthiest aircraft around even while they are not giving off any radio emissions. Although getting close enough to do so before getting killed by a long-range air-to-air missile is still a major limiting factor of these systems as they have limited range and are impacted by atmospheric conditions. It’s also worth noting that this system could also provide an image of the aircraft beyond-visual-range, which can help with being able to take the first shot under tight rules of engagement. The Super Hornet’s IRST21 is integrated into the forward part of a centerline fuel tank. The system will be fielded before the end of the decade. On F-15Cs it will be flown in a Legion Pod and the Talon HATE pod . , USN An advanced IRST was also promised for the F-22 as part of the Advanced Tactical Fighter Program but it was axed due to cost-cutting measures as the program moved from prototype to a production configuration. Today, the Navy and the USAF are on the cusp of procuring podded IRST systems for their 4th generation fighters. The F-35 can use its electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) for long-range aircraft identification and some limited IRST-like functions but is not comparable to a dedicated sensor. Directional Infrared Countermeasures System Like the F-22, the Su-57 has a number of missile launch detector apertures scattered around the aircraft but the Su-57 also has turrets that fire modulated laser beams at an incoming missile’s seeker to blind it and throw it off course. The Russian system used on the Su-57 is part of the larger N101KS electro-optical suite that includes the missile launch detector systems, IRST, and the DIRCM turrets mounted dorsally behind the cockpit and ventrally under the cockpit. The upper and lower 101KS-O DIRCM bubbles can be seen in this image. Not all T-50s/Su-57s have been equipped with this system yet, but it is a core feature of the design., Chinese Internet This soft-kill system has been seen mounted on a number of Su-57 prototypes, and if it works as advertised, it can go a long way to defending the aircraft against advanced infrared-homing—also referred to as ‘heat seeking’—missiles. This includes the shoulder-fired man-portable air defense system (MANDPAD) variety and the air-to-air variety. DIRCM systems, which have been in use by the U.S. military and its allies for nearly two decades, are largely understood to be more effective against advanced imaging infrared seekers than expendable countermeasures like flares or BOL-IR decoys . Russia has installed fairly clunky DIRCM systems on some of its helicopters and airlift fleet, but nothing as miniaturized as seen on the Su-57, which rivals U.S. systems in its compactness. But in Syria, in particular, Russia fear of MANPADs is potent, and rightfully so. Having a DIRCM system on a jet fighter is largely unprecedented. The concept certainly exists, but currently, these self-protection suites are largely installed on transport aircraft and helicopters as defenses against MANPADs, not against air-to-air missiles. And denying attacks by air-to-air missiles is definitely an intent for the Su-57’s DIRCM system as, once again, it has a turret on top of the jet as well. So in this sense, the Su-57 is something of a pioneer in this regard and this type of system is also likely a hedge against future long-range infrared-guided and dual-model air-to-air missiles . Austere Airfields Welcome Russian fighters, even advanced and stealthy ones apparently, are designed with ruggedness in mind. Beyond featuring heavy-duty landing gear and big tires, along with mudguards over their nose-wheels, MiG-29 derivatives even have intake doors that close off airflow from directly in front of and below the jet during taxiing operations. Some Su-27s had screens that worked in a similar fashion. The Su-57 doesn’t have any intake barriers that we have seen, but it does have the robust landing gear, including mudguard, that is reminiscent of its predecessors. The Su-57 may be the highest technology Russia has to offer, but it retained the hardy landing gear of its predecessors., Russian Embassy If you have ever seen Russian airfields—at least some of them—the need for tough landing gear isn’t surprising. But this can also come in really handy when executing dispersed operations to airfields and roadways that don’t have the luxury of a small army of sweeper vehicles. In this regard, many American aircraft fall short, and that’s somewhat of an issue considering the Pentagon is becoming ever more focused on austere and highly distributed aircraft operations throughout the Pacific during a crisis. And this initiative includes pushing more fragile jets like the Raptor, and even Reaper drones , in small groups to far-flung island airstrips. 3D Thrust Vectoring: We have discussed how thrust vectoring has limited utility throughout most of a fighter’s flight envelope —with it being most useful at very high altitudes and speeds , or in the near or post-stall regime—but it’s still a cool feature to have, especially if other advantages remain out of technological reach. Considering the tradeoffs in design and capabilities the Su-57 represents, being able to outmaneuver the enemy within visual range is still a positive, especially considering it may not be able to avoid a fight like some of its more stealthy counterparts. 3D thrust vectoring at lower speeds and altitudes allows for some incredible acrobatic feats , but really it has drastically diminishing returns, and can even be dangerous to fully utilize during anything but a one-on-one within visual range fight. Ending up in a totally depleted energy state may get the kill, but if other fighters are nearby, and they usually are, it probably means you get to die too. Nonetheless, it’s there on the Su-57 and it’s the first time 3D thrust vectoring has integrated included into a stealthy fighter. Unique Weapons Bay Configuration The Su-57 has a unique tandem weapons bay. We still don’t know much about it conclusively, but it seems as if four to six medium-range air-to-air missiles can be carried at one time internally. Depending on the depth of the bays, it’s possible fewer, larger weapons could be carried instead—such as guided bombs or air-to-surface standoff missiles—but we will have to wait for more official information and photo evidence in order to discuss this further with confidence. The jet also supposedly features a pair of short-range air-to-air missile bays located under its wing-roots. These triangular, canoe-like structures are said to open like a clamshell to expose the missile inside during combat. Once again, to our knowledge, there are no actual photos of this system being used, and it’s a little puzzling trying to figure out how a missile like the R-73 could fit in there. Maybe a specialized missile with a smaller diameter profile is intended for those bays sometime in the future. In the end, it’s clear Russia has done the best it can when it comes to making up for limitations low-observable know-how by adding other capabilities that would help the Su-57 survive in a fight. And as we always like to stress, stealth is just one part of an array of measures that can collectively mean the difference between life and death in the air combat arena. Electronic warfare especially, when combined with low observability, is becoming more of a factor than ever in modern a combat. And remember, when we talk about stealth, even on just the radio frequency spectrum, we are talking about how far away a target can be detected and how far it can be engaged using a particular radar operating on a particular band while viewing a target from a particular aspect. Given the same X-band pulse doppler radar set, maybe (just for hypothetical example) a Su-27 can be detected head-on at 90 miles, while an Su-57 can be detected head-on at 35 miles while the F-22 can be detected at under ten miles. Sure that’s a big disparity in performance, but that’s just one aspect of a very complex air combat equation. Once again, this includes networking, the sensitivity of onboard passive sensors, standoff weapon performance, degrees of low-observability from various aspects, electronic warfare, tactics, speed, range, the persistent support aircraft like airborne early warning and control aircraft, and so much more. The cost of the aircraft itself and the quantitative advantage that may go along with it can’t also be overlooked. We don’t know the exact quality and level of integration of the Su-57’s sensors and mission systems, but on paper at least, no, the Su-57 isn’t ‘junk’ at all. It represents a rather clever mix of capabilities that are tailored to Russia’s more austere, less networked, air-battle doctrine, and it’s more than capable of taking on enemies it’s more likely to fight than some Armageddon war with the United States. That being said, with tight rules of engagement, like those over Syria, many of even its most capable opponent’s abilities are rendered neutral anyway. So if Russia can continue to finance it and sort out its engine issues, the Su-57 is set to become a capable highly valued fighter that is better than anything else in the Russian Air Force’s inventory. But is it an F-22? No, it isn’t. And that’s the problem—clearly it isn’t meant to be. Yet it seems Russian officials and the Russian press constantly make claims otherwise. That’s like claiming a Super Hornet is as capable in certain respects as an F-35, it simply isn’t accurate and it’s not really a fair comparison to make in the first place. Above all else, you have to give the Russians some credit for taking new risks with their design and incorporating innovative concepts into it, even if doing so came as a result of lacking critical low observable design knowledge and manufacturing capabilities.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yet another foreign strike has targeted Iranian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria, this time resulting in such force it registered as a literal earthquake. Regional media outlets variously placing responsibility on Israel or the United States and the United Kingdom. After the operation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a major press conference excoriating Iran over its nuclear program and accusing it of lying about its compliance with an already controversial internationally-backed deal to restrict its nuclear ambitions , which might be on the verge of collapsing. This latest bombardment occurred late on April 29, 2018, reportedly hitting the Syrian Arab Army’s 47th Brigade military base and arms depots in Salhab, both near the city of Hama, as well as Nairab Military Airport in Aleppo further to the north. On April 30, 2018, Netanyahu held an emergency meeting with his national security cabinet ahead of publicly revealing a trove of documentation regarding Iran’s nuclear weapons development programs, saying it proved Iran had been acting in bad faith despite agreeing to halt its nuclear efforts. The Israeli prime minister did not offer any clear evidence that Iran was actively building nuclear weapons in contravention of an agreement with the United States and other world powers, though. An earth-shaking strike A source representing the pro-Syrian government alliance that includes Iran and its proxies in the country, such as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, told The New York Times that the strike on the 47th Brigade facilities destroyed approximately 200 unspecified “missiles.” Unconfirmed video from local witnesses that subsequently appeared on social media showed massive explosions. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center recorded a disturbance registering 2.6 Richter magnitude scale in the same area. 10/ Another image of one of the sites struck in #Aleppo yesterday evening pic.twitter.com/EQlqVY5atM — Danny Makki (@danny_makki) April 30, 2018 The same source also told The Times that the strikes killed 16 personnel, including nearly a dozen Iranians, in Hama. Syrian rebels claimed that nearly 40 more individuals died as stand-off weapons rained down on the 47th Brigade and the separate site in Salhab. The independent U.K.-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that its sources reported that the operation had killed nearly 30 people, including both Iranians and Iraqi Shia militiamen . Semi-official Iranian outlets acknowledged the strikes, but denied anyone had died at all. At the time of writing, there has been no official count from Iranian or Syrian officials. A map showing the epicenter of an “earthquake” that the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center recorded during the strikes., EMSC The reported focus on the missiles suggests that the operation was the latest in a string of Israeli operations to, at least in part, neutralize Iranian forces and their partners in Syria from deploying advanced air defense capabilities. Earlier in April 2018, Israel reportedly destroyed one of Iran’s Russian-made Tor-M1 mobile, short-to-medium range surface-to-air missile systems in a strike against Tiyas Air Base , also known as T4, situated between the Syrian cities of Homs and Palmyra. There are reports that a Syrian Il-76 cargo plane left Iran’s Mehrabad Airport and touched down in Hama on April 28, 2018. In the aftermath of the U.S.-led missile barrage against Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure on April 14, 2018, there has also been increased speculation and rumors that Iran, as well as Russia, could look to bolster the regime’s ability to ward off future attacks in general. In particular, there have been reports that the Kremlin might deliver long-range S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Syria, or may have done so already, but so far there is no indication that those shipments have occurred or are necessarily imminent. The Russians do appear to have sent additional Pantsir-S1 point-defense focused weapons to the country, some of which may now be under Syrian military control or otherwise deployed to support regime forces. Those systems would be well suited to at least making an attempt to shoot down incoming stand-off weapons in any future strike. A Syrian Ministry of Defense video from earlier in April 2018 showing various air defense systems the country has in service, which does not include any evidence of S-300s from Russia. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7Yq5oqzbAw0 Rumors of U.S., U.K. involvement An initial report from at least one Syrian news outlet had also suggested that the latest strikes in Hama and Aleppo had actually been another U.S.-U.K. operation , possibly involving High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS , firing 227mm GPS-guided rockets from near the Jordanian border. If this was the case, it would likely have been in retaliation for recent pro-regime militia attacks on Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, a U.S.-backed, largely Kurdish force operating in Eastern Syria. The United States has deployed HIMARS to the At Tanf garrison in Southern Syria near the Jordanian border and sites in Jordan proper. The U.S. military has also sent the weapons to Turkey and Eastern Syria. The video below shows U.S. Army HIMARS launchers firing rockets in Syria. However, 227mm rockets have a range of less than 40 miles, which is not nearly enough to hit targets in western Syria from any of these locations. There are no reports that American troops have employed the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS , a quasi-ballistic missile, in support of its Syrian operations, which would have been able to do reach Aleppo and Hama. There are also unconfirmed reports that Syrian or pro-Assad forces recovered various parts from GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs after the strikes, but Israel, as well as the United States, have these weapons. It is also possible these components are the remnants of past operations the U.S. military conducted elsewhere in Syria. For years now the U.S. military had employed the small, 250-pound class weapons in Syria, including on F-22 Raptor stealth fighters , which have been an increasingly regular sight overhead in Eastern Syria .

Varela (@niklasgv) April 30, 2018 Whatever the case, British and American officials have both denied the country took part in any such operation on April 29, 2018, as well. Israeli officials have declined to confirm or deny that it conducted the strikes, which they do as a general rule after any such incident. In a rare and unusual comment during an interview on Army Radio, the Israel Defense Forces official radio station, Israel’s Intelligence Minister Israel Katz did say he was “ not aware ” of strikes near Hama and Aleppo on April 30, 2019. “[But] all the violence and instability in Syria is the result of Iran’s attempts to establish a military presence there. Israel will not allow the opening of a northern front in Syria,” he added, echoing a well-established Israeli government position. ‘Iran, Iran, Iran’ This statement came as there were reports that Israel’s national security cabinet, which includes Katz, would hold an unscheduled meeting. Reports said this would cover developments on the country’s “northern border,” a common reference to the situation in Syria, and new information regarding Iran’s controversial nuclear program, which we will touch on in a moment. On April 29, 2018, Israel’s fiery Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman had made similar comments at the annual Jerusalem Post conference, declaring that Israel had three problems in the region, “ Iran, Iran, [and] Iran .” He had earlier suggested Israeli forces could launch a strike if Russia delivered S-300s to Syria. “We have no intention to attack Russia or to interfere in domestic Syrian issues,” Lieberman said at the conference, before stressing Israel would not give up “freedom of movement” on the issue. “If somebody thinks that it is possible to launch missiles or to attack Israel or even our aircraft, no doubt we will respond and we will respond very forcefully.” And though the United States has said it was not involved, the U.S. government may have given at least tacit approval for the latest strikes. Also on April 29, 2018, newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, formerly Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of a larger visit to Israel. “We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region, and Iran’s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains,” Pompeo said at a shared press conference with Netanyahu. “The United States is with Israel in this fight and we strongly support Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu., State Department ‘Iran lied’ All of this comes as U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration step up their attacks on a multi-national deal that curtailed Iranian nuclear work in exchange for easing of sanctions and other incentives. Critics have said the arrangement, which previous President Barack Obama and his administration helped craft and argue for, only enabled Iran to pursue malign activities throughout the Middle East and beyond. On April 30, 2018, following the meeting with his national security ministers, Netanyahu held a press conference in which he declared that “Iran lied” about its nuclear program and had squirreled away technical information on nuclear weapons at a secret location in its capital Tehran. Israeli intelligence services had been able to acquire more than a thousand pounds of this material, which Israel had then shared with the United States.

The decision to acknowledge that operation appeared to be, at least in part, a signal to Iran indicating Israel’s capability and willingness to take military action against its nuclear facilities, if necessary. Codenamed Project Amad, the Iranian nuclear weapons program reportedly aimed to produce and test at least five warheads, each with a 10 kiloton yield. India, Pakistan, and North Korea detonated between five and six devices to validate their own nuclear weapons capabilities before moving to computer modeling for further nuclear warhead development. Production examples presumably would have gone on top of Iran’s longer-range ballistic missiles, which can already reach Israel . It is worth noting that it is a largely open secret that Israel maintains its own nuclear deterrent . In addition, years of reports by the independent International Atomic Energy Agency , as well as U.S. National Intelligence Estimates , had largely concluded this was the case already. Whether or not Iran’s decision to retain the technical data after 2003, when publicly available reports suggest the country suspended its active nuclear weapons program, constitutes actually lying about maintaining such a project at all is debatable. Even if Iran had destroyed the physical documentation, it is hard to understand how it could have fully purged the knowledge base, such as the scientists themselves, that it had cultivated to produce nuclear weapons. . @netanyahu : “The Iran deal, the nuclear deal, is based on lies.” https://t.co/bPC4Sp9TRR pic.twitter.com/8xJBnMrC8y — Fox News (@FoxNews) April 30, 2018 Death to the Iran deal Regardless, it is likely to give more ammunition to U.S. President Donald Trump, and his administration, who has long said that he would throw out the deal if it was otherwise impossible to renegotiate the terms and “fix” it to encompass a broader set of issues. The agreement only covers Iranian nuclear activities and does not address the country’s ballistic missile development program , its support for international terrorist groups and other militants , and its continued calls for the destruction of Israel, among other things . It is reasonable to ask why the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA, does not take any of the factors into account. It is also worth questioning whether scrapping the entire existing arrangement is the best possible course of action, though it seems increasingly likely that this will be the case. Both Pompeo and Trump’s new National Security Adviser John Bolton are vehemently opposed to the deal in its present form, while Iran has it is unwilling to entertain any changes to its terms. Both sides are increasingly accusing the other of acting in bad faith, further marring the stability of the JCPOA no matter what happens formally. The United States says Iran is not abiding by the principle of the deal in not reducing regional tensions, while Iranian authorities complain that both the U.S. government and international watchdogs have repeatedly certified that it is fully complying with the agreement’s provisions. We at The War Zone have already written on this issue in depth and have explored what might happen should the deal final crumble. After the Trump Administration unveiled a new over-arching policy toward Iran in October 2017, I wrote : “If the Iran Deal were to collapse, it would remove the only present impediment, no matter how weak, to Iran resuming an active and open nuclear weapons program. This, in turn, could easily prompt calls, in America and Israel in particular, for preemptive military action to neutralize this threat. There has been a significant amount of public support from policymakers and politicians for strikes against Iranian nuclear and military sites in the past. “We at The War Zone has already explored the heavily intertwined nature of present Middle Eastern geopolitics in detail and any attack on  Iranian soil could easily turn into a regional conflagration, if not touch off even broader conflicts or political disputes. The Saudis already appear to be preparing for this with the purchase of a massive ballistic missile shield that will almost certainly be pointed at Iran. The immediate sanctions against the IRGC could lead Iran to authorize more direct covert  activities or otherwise increase support to groups looking to attack  Americans.” Since then, the situation in Syria has increasingly come to reflect the concerns we had already voiced, with Israel deepening its military involvement in the conflict in order to prevent Iran from establishing a firmer foothold in the region along its borders. The Trump Administration has also been investigating the possibility of turning over military activities in Eastern Syria to a coalition with Egypt or Saudi Arabia , both major opponents of Iran and its growing regional influence, at the helm. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman smiles as U.S. President Donald Trump uses a poster board to illustrate the American weapons Saudi Arabia has and is purchasing during a meeting in March 2018., Kevin Dietsch/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP A new conflict in Syria and beyond Hezbollah has already said it might launch a major, outright assault on Israeli on a number of occasions over its reported strikes in Syria and did so again after the U.S., U.K., and French missiles hit Assad. The group has thousands of rockets , including some increasingly able to hit targets deep within Israel, and offers Iran a very willing proxy for responding indirectly to any threats that might follow the failure of the JCPOA. There is also the distinct possibility that if Iran were to resume its nuclear weapons program absent the deal, that other countries in the region could follow, triggering a regional nuclear arms race. While Israel already has a nuclear arsenal, Saudi Arabia has said it would start developing its own in response to any Iranian developments. The United Arab Emirates, which is actively developing its civilian nuclear program , and Egypt, which has conducted a number of its own unreported nuclear activities , might follow suit. From left to right, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting in the Turkish capital Ankara in April 2018., Sergey Guneev / Sputnik  via AP Beyond the Middle East, an end to the Iran deal could have second-order effects on attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, as well as its other malign activities. South Korean President Moon Jae In and North Korean Premier Kim Jong Un recently concluded a historic summit in South Korea and Trump is set to meet with North Korea’s leader in the weeks ahead. It is already unclear whether Kim intends to negotiate in good faith, but he is undoubtedly watching events vis-à-vis Iran as he develops his own strategy for engaging with the international community. National Security Adviser Bolton’s recent suggestion of applying a “ Libya model ” to North Korea, by which it gives up its entire nuclear arsenal and infrastructure in exchange for various incentives, is likely to be a non-starter in Pyongyang. It’s not even clear if the concepts the United States employed in Libya would be workable with regards to North Korea to begin with, since the North Korean regime has actual nuclear weapons and delivery systems. The fact that the United States led an international coalition that facilitated rebels in unseating and then murdering Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi’s after he surrendered his nascent nuclear weapons program won’t exactly put the model in a good light to Kim, either. But the latest apparent Israeli strikes in Syria still point to the country being “ground zero” for any immediate impact of the collapse of JCPOA, which could easily pave the way for Israel to expand its military action against Iranian forces there, possibly with increasingly direct American support. This, in turn, though, could prompt various actors, in the country and nearby, to take a more active stance in response, setting that stage for a new and potentially devastating collision of regional and global interests.

(@ImageSatIntl) April 30, 2018 Whatever the specific targets were, they appear to be thoroughly demolished. This aligns with what we saw in the video footage of the strikes themselves, which showed at least one massive explosion followed by a significant secondary detonation, indicating the missiles, ammunition, or other items inside one of the buildings “cooked off” after the incoming weapons hit their mark.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 8, 2019",The Navy’s Stealthy Glide Bomb Is About To Get Way More Capable,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just recently, Raytheon announced that it had finished the work necessary to integrate its AGM-154 Joint Stand-Off Weapon glide bomb, or JSOW, into the internal weapons bays on the U.S. Navy’s F-35C Joint Strike Fighter . It’s an important development, especially given that the service is also developing a powered version with quadruple the range, but half the cost of other available air-launched cruise missiles. Earlier in April 2018, the Massachusetts-headquartered defense contractor declared that the F-35C was fully capable of carrying the AGM-154 internally and that the pairing would now move on to operational testing. The goal is for the weapon to reach initial operational capability as an internal option on the Navy’s variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF, at some point in 2019. On April 23, 2018, the Navy also announced plans to proceed with the next phase of development of a powered AGM-154C variant, also known the Joint Stand-Off Weapon Extended Range, or JSOW-ER. Stand-off firepower for the Navy’s F-35Cs “This is absolutely a critical opportunity for the Navy because now this is their top-line, medium-range precision strike weapon that is capable now of being integrated internally on JSF,” Mark Borup, a representative of Raytheon’s Medium-Range Strike and Attack Air Warfare Systems Division, told Military.com in an interview on April 10, 2018. Carried internally, the weapons will allow the service’s F-35Cs to attack targets from a safer, stand-off distance even when in full stealth mode. There are plans in the future to allow the jets to carry it externally, as well. USN As it stands now, the JSOW is the only stand-off air-to-ground weapon the Navy has a firm timeline for adding as an internally-carried option for its F-35Cs. The service has two versions of the 1,000-pound class weapon, the AGM-154A-1 and the AGM-154C-1. A chart showing planned F-35 weapons options as of 2015., DOD The AGM-154A-1, or JSOW-A, has a BLU-111/B high explosive bomb inside. This type is particularly useful against troops, light vehicles, and surface-to-air missile sites out in the open. The latter target set is particularly important and the JSOW-A gives U.S. Navy carrier-borne aircraft an important stand-off means of attacking enemy air defenses to help clear the way for follow-on strikes. Combined with the F-35, it could be an especially capable option for neutralizing threats to pave the way for subsequent missions by non-stealthy platforms. An F-35C carries two inert AGM-154C Joint Stand-Off Weapons during a test., Lockheed Martin The AGM-154C-1, or JSOW-C, is a bunker-buster that can punch through hardened structures thanks to a specialized warhead, known as the British Royal Augmentation Charge or BROACH. U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems is responsible for this part of the weapon. BROACH is actually multiple explosive payloads stacked together. The weapon uses a 220-pound initial charge to pierce reinforced concrete and other barriers and a second 320-pound warhead with a delay fuze option to destroy whatever is inside. A plane’s crew can also set the fuze to change the timing on the first explosion, either allowing the momentum of the weapon to provide increased penetration or setting off both charges at the same time. The latter mode would be more useful for destroying less robust buildings or fortifications or attacking targets out in the open. Both AGM-154 variants use its pop-out wings to glide up to 70 miles when aircraft release it at high altitude. At lower altitudes, it can still sail approximately 15 miles from the launch point to its target. It also has a low-observable shape to help reduce the chance of the enemy detecting and attempting to shoot it down, and give them less time to do so even if they do spot the weapon before it hits its mark. An F/A-18F Super Hornet carries a JSOW with an inert warhead during a recent training exercise out of Point Mugu., Matt Hartman The two versions use GPS-assisted inertial navigation to guide them to the target and the pilot can also tell the guidance system to follow specific waypoints, to avoid enemy defenses or other obstacles, and set the optimal angle of attack, such as a shallow glide or a diving strike from above. A two-way data link allows the launching platform to send new instructions to the weapon in flight, as well. USN In 2007, Raytheon also began development of an AGM-154C Block III subvariant with an improved guidance system, which became the AGM-154C-1, which adds an imaging infrared seeker to spot and home in on targets during the terminal stage of its flight. This improves this variant’s accuracy and gives it the ability to strike moving ships. Two decades of JSOW This is all a far cry from the weapon as it existed when it first entered service in the 1990s. The original AGM-154A version the Navy employed in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan relied in no small part on a payload of 145 small bomblets to make sure it hit the target. Originally a joint U.S. Air Force and Navy program, the former service decided to stop buying new weapons in 2004, effectively dropping out of the project. Plans for an AGM-154B version with six “smart” Sensor Fuzed Munition bomblets, each with its own infrared sensors to locate and attack armored vehicles, came to an end after the Air Force decided instead to purchase the GPS-assisted inertial navigation system guided Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser cluster bomb instead. This complete system, known as the Sensor Fuzed Weapon , is significantly less expensive, but also has a far more limited stand-off capability than that of the planned JSOW-B. The Air Force also pulled its remaining JSOW-A variants out of service after President George W. Bush’s administration issued new guidelines on cluster munitions in 2008. Though the Air Force’s F-15E Strike Eagle , F-16C/D Vipers , B-1B Bones , B-52 BUFF , and B-2 Spirits are all able to carry the weapon, the Air Force no longer employs any version of the weapon. At present, the Navy is the only U.S. military service to still field this weapon in any form, with the F/A-18C/D Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet acting the launch platforms. The service expects to keep JSOW in inventory at least through 2025 and does not yet have plans for a specific replacement weapon. JSOW, and the JSOW-C in particular, has also enjoyed a certain amount of export success. Nearly a dozen foreign air forces – Australia, Canada, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, Poland, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates – have or are actively considering purchasing the weapon. The primary launch platforms in those countries are various versions of the F-16 Viper and the F/A-18 Hornet, though the Saudis employ them on their F-15S Eagles . JSOW has also since found itself overshadowed by other developments, especially with regards to Lockheed Martin’s low-observable AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM , a turbojet-powered cruise missile with far greater range and its own multi-mode targeting and low-observable features. The standard AGM-158A notably saw its first operational employment on April 14, 2018, when B-1B bombers launched nearly 20 of them during a U.S.-led missile barrage against Syrian government chemical weapons sites. Glide bomb to cruise missile But its inclusion in and importance to the Navy’s F-35C plans may help breathe added life into the program once again. Most notably, the service is once again exploring the possibility of a powered JSOW-Extended Range, or JSOW-ER, cruise missile variant. That idea is not new, with Raytheon first offering a proposed variant with the Williams International WJ24-8 turbojet for the U.K.’s Conventionally Armed Standoff Missile (CASOM) program. European consortium MBDA’s Storm Shadow cruise missile, which the Royal Air Force also employed in the recent Syria strikes , eventually won that competition. Raytheon flight tested another ER variant in 2009, amid renewed interest and the possibility that the U.S. military might cancel the JASSM following poor test results . This version featured a Hamilton Sundstrand TJ-50 turbojet, which Raytheon uses on the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy system, and a flush-mounted intake to preserve the weapon’s low-observable characteristics. In 2012, Hamilton Sundstrand’s parent company, United Technologies Corporation, merged it with the Goodrich Corporation to form UTC Aerospace Systems. In June 2017, the Navy revealed it was again moving forward with an evaluation of the JSOW-ER yet again. The Hamilton Sundstrand-powered version reportedly had a maximum range nearly 265 miles. This would give it slightly more stand-off capability that the regular JASSM, but the AGM-158B JASSM-ER would still outrange it by 300 miles. More importantly, with the work already done in fitting the JSOW into the F-35C’s internal weapons bays, it could require less effort to integrate the powered JSOW-ER than with an entirely separate design. Hamilton Sundstrand type reportedly had the same dimensions as the standard AGM-154C-1 Lockheed Martin says it has plans to add JASSM to the Joint Strike Fighter’s arsenal, but it’s not clear when that might happen. And while JASSM is the same length as the JSOW, it’s wider, which might make it harder for it to fit internally on any variant of the jet, which could make JSOW-ER attractive to the Air Force as a future option on its F-35As. Unfortunately, the Marine Corps’ F-35B’s truncated weapons bays are already too small to accommodate the JSOW. This briefing slide shows proposed additional weapons for the F-35, without any firm schedule, as of 2015. JASSM and LRASM are conspicuously absent. Possible weapons for US military variants are highlighted in pink, while others that could become available for foreign examples are in black., DOD Foreign air forces already buying the F-35A variant and who already have stocks of JSOWs, such as Australia and the Netherlands, might also be interested in this type of stand-off capability. This might also help spread out the cost of integrating the JSOW-ER onto that version of the JSF. It might make it a good stand-off option for any future unmanned combat air vehicles, as well. Interestingly, a promotional video Lockheed Martin put together to pitch its entrant to the Navy’s carrier-based MQ-25 tanker drone program , a portion of which is seen below, also includes a computer-generated rendering of an armed version, complete with a pair JSOWs. Lockheed Martin A low-cost missile option Cost might make the JSOW-ER a favorable alternative to other low-observable cruise missiles, such as JASSM or Storm Shadow, even on existing, non-stealthy aircraft. Lockheed Martin has found it difficult just to get the price of JASSM down to $800,000 apiece . Storm Shadow’s unit cost is still over $1 million . As of 2008, Raytheon claimed that it could make JSOW-ERs for just $350,000 each . Even if that price point has doubled since then, a powered version could easily be competitive with the other options available on the market. In addition, Raytheon could potentially offer lower cost upgrade kits to customers who already own stocks of the older glide bombs to convert them into cruise missiles. A lower cost, extended-range, air-launched cruise missile could be a boon for any air force that can’t necessarily afford or is otherwise having trouble acquiring a fifth-generation aircraft, but faces potential opponents with expanding air defense capabilities, too. As the range and precision of surface-to-air missiles , and the sensors that cue them , improves around the world, the desire for more and better cost-effective stand-off weapons will only increase in general. They will also need to be relatively cheap if any country expects to be able to employ them in significant numbers for a protracted period of time without incurring prohibitive costs. The U.S. Air Force is separately tackling this cost issue, as well as others, in a program to explore the possibility inexpensive swarming cruise missiles. The JSOW-ER might provide a good starting place for that project, as well. With a lower or competitive cost to JASSM, the JSOW-ER might also present a competitor to Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile ( LRASM ) variant. This could be particularly appealing to the Navy if Lockheed Martin does end up having difficulty fitting the JASSM or LRASM internally into the F-35. The combination would give carrier battle groups a more survivable means of attacking enemy surface ships in complex and constrained battlespaces, such as the Baltic Sea or the South China Sea , where aircraft might face threats from both land- and sea-based air defenses simultaneously. For the U.S. Navy in particular, having the gliding JSOW and powered JSOW-ER in its inventory makes heaps of sense when it comes to ‘kicking down the enemy’s door’ and crippling its air defenses. For the stealthy F-35, a hard to detect ‘low-observable’ or stealthy aircraft, JSOW provides enough standoff range to give the F-35 a good margin of survivability against advanced surface-to-air missile batteries. Meanwhile, the Super Hornet doesn’t have such a luxury but it could safely execute the same mission using the long-range JSOW-ER. Other countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea, that will be operating the F-35 alongside 4th generation fighters, could also leverage synergies of having both types JSOWs in service, especially for the destruction of enemy air defenses role. It’s a bit puzzling why the USAF wouldn’t also follow suit. Novel payloads And since Texas Instruments, the defense business unit of which Raytheon bought in 1997, designed the JSOW initially to carry modular payloads, it is possible that the system may have additional growth potential in the future. As noted, the defense contractor was already able to successfully developed a subvariant of the JSOW-A with an entirely different category of warhead, replacing dozens of individual submunitions with a unitary charge. Another option might be the BLU-134/B bomb, previously known as the BLU-111D/B, which uses a cast ductile iron shell to create a larger amount of more uniform shrapnel as an alternative to cluster munitions. You can read about the BLU-134/B in greater detail here . Other bunker-busting and low-collateral damage type warheads could also be future options, as well as improved sensor-aided cluster munitions. Future versions of the JSOW might be able to readily accept non-kinetic payloads, such as a high-powered microwave emitter that disables enemy electronics or another type of electronic warfare package. JSOWs are moved around an aircraft carrier’s deck before being loaded onto jets. , USN The Air Force and the Navy are already working together on just such a program, called High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike, or HiJENKS , which appears to be a spiritual successor to the Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project, or CHAMP . Boeing made a limited number of the latter weapons using a modified version of the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM). So far, neither service has offered details about the platform that will carry this payload, though some have speculated it could be a JASSM-derivative. The final HiJENKS system, or a version thereof, might be able to fit inside a modified JSOW-ER, as well. The U.S. Air Force video includes a computer-generated montage of potential future air warfare concepts, including a missile likely carrying a high-powered microwave weapon that blacks out an entire city. That segment begins at 4:00 in the runtime. Possible hurdles A longer-range, powered JSOW-ER might still end up being more costly in the end if it becomes necessary to add additional systems to help it operate autonomously in a GPS-denied environment or otherwise counter other emerging enemy defenses. Both JASSM and LRASM have specific features to help them get to their target even if they lose GPS connectivity or the beyond-line-of-sight data links get jammed. The JSOW’s Block II upgrade did add components to help resist GPS-jamming, but this was based on the threat as it existed in the mid-2000s. Since then, concerns about hostile GPS jamming and spoofing , as well as other electronic warfare attacks , have only continued to grow. LRASM also has onboard electronic support measures and radar warning receivers to help it automatically dodge threats. In addition to using its own infrared imaging seeker to prioritize targets, it can use those emissions to help classify them. It could lead to additional cost growth to add these additional capabilities onto the JSOW-ER. Still, with the Navy having made it clear that it expects the JSOW to be the primary air-launched stand-off weapon available to its carrier strike groups for the foreseeable future, there will be an impetus to further improve the weapon. Its low cost and modular nature may allow the service to more easily entice either the Air Force or foreign partners to join in those efforts to help share the developmental and cost burdens. All told, the JSOW could be heading toward a comeback with a host of new powered and unpowered variants competing against other, more expensive options.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 16, 2018",Kim Jong Un Steps Over The Line: Everything We Know About The Historic Summit,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than five months after the same area erupted in gunfire as North Korean border guards tried to kill a soldier fleeing into the South, Panmunjom has hosted a historic summit between North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae In. In a joint declaration, the two leaders pledged to end the war between their two countries, denuclearize the Peninsula and otherwise reduce tensions , establish a new joint liaison office with representatives on both sides of the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, help reconnect families the conflict had split apart, and work to improve ties in various other ways, including maybe upgrading North Korea’s rail network. The event was notable right from the start, with Kim, flanked by a large security detail and an even larger entourage of other officials and aids, emerged from the Panmun Pavilion on the North Korean side of Panmunjom. He then walked to the low wall separating the two countries at the site and shook hands with Moon. In an unplanned and highly symbolic move, the South Korean president briefly crossed over into the North before both leaders stepped over into the South together holding hands. “My heart won’t stop fluttering, to meet at such a historic location” Kim reportedly told Moon when they first met. Observers said the young ruler appeared visibly anxious – no doubt a mixture of excitement and apprehension about visiting a country with a stated policy of making him live in constant fear of assassination. “Also, I’m very moved that you have come all the way to [military demarcation line] to greet” Kim added. “It was a very courageous decision for you to come all the way here,” Moon said in response. The two leaders and their respective parties then moved on to the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. Built in 1989 on the site of a temporary structure that hosted a meeting between North and South Korean Prime Ministers in 1990, this building has served as a location for various high-level engagements since then. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, his personal adviser and senior member of North Korea’s Communist party, hands him a pen to sign the guestbook at the Peace House at Panmunjom as Moon, left, looks on., AP “A new history begins now,” Kim wrote in the guestbook. “At the starting point of history and the era of peace.” “As I walked over here, I thought, why was it so difficult to get here?” Kim said as the two groups sat down for their initial meeting in the newly remodeled boardroom . “The separating line wasn’t even that high to cross. It was too easy to walk over that line and it took us 11 years to get here.” “Chairman Kim, for the first time in our history you crossed the military demarcation line,” Moon said in his own remarks. “The military demarcation line is no longer a symbol of division but a symbol of peace.” Kim, left, and Moon shake hands during a formal press conference at the beginning of their April 2018 summit., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP “Over the past seven decades we weren’t able to communicate, so I think we can talk the whole day today,” Moon added, reportedly drawing a laugh from Kim. After the various public statements and photo-ops, the two sides set to work. Im Jong Suk, South Korea’s Chief Presidential Secretary, and Suh Hoon, chief of the South Korean National Intelligence Service – analogous to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency – flanked Moon at the meeting. Kim Yong Chol, Vice Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Central Committee and Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo Jong, who acts as his personal adviser and also serves as Vice Director of the Central Committee, were also in attendance. The Workers’ Party of Korea is the formal name for the ruling Communist political party in North Korea. At left, top to bottom, Suh Hoon, Moon Jae In, and Im Jong Suk represent South Korea. At right, from North Korea, are, top to bottom, Kim Yong Chol, Kim Jong Un, and Kim Yo Jong., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP The two sides then broke for lunch on their respective sides of the DMZ before returning for more meetings at the Peace House. Kim’s security detail followed him jogged alongside his limousine as he departed the area. They performed this maneuver again when he returned and later in the evening when he departed after the summit came to an end. Moon agreed in principle to visit Pyongyang and Kim said he would be equally willing to go to Seoul. In a rare acknowledgment of conditions inside North Korea, the country’s premier also said that there would have to be significant improvements to his country’s transportation networks ahead of the South Korean president’s arrival. “If [Moon] comes to the North after living in the South, it may be embarrassing,” Kim said. “We will make preparations for a comfortable visit.” The state of North Korea’s transportation networks was a particular issue. North Korean officials reportedly spoke of how impressed they were by South Korea’s high-speed rail networks and Kim himself talked about the possibility of expanding such a system all the way to the Chinese border in the future. Members of the North Korean delegation would have had experience with South Korea’s more advanced infrastructure just recently after taking part in the Winter Olympics in the South Korean city of PyeongChang. North Korean security personnel jog alongside a limousine carrying Kim Jong Un as he returns to Panmunjom following lunch in the North., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP Rail remains an especially important mechanism for travel and trade in North Korea and Kim recently used a specialized bullet-proof luxury train to travel to China in March 2018 for a secretive state visit. The country’s roads are notoriously poor and on the eve of the summit 32 Chinese nationals, along with four North Korean officials, died in a tour bus crash in North Korea. “If the railroad is connected with the North, both the South and North can use high-speed trains,” Moon said. “This is contained in the joint declarations of June 15 [2000], and Oct. 4 [2007], but it has not been executed over the past 10 years.” Moon, left, and Kim talk during their summit., Korea Summit Press Pool/Kyodo via AP There was also a ceremonial tree planting near the DMZ, which was especially notable given that, in his time in the South Korean Army, Moon had participated in Operation Paul Bunyan in 1976. The mission involved cutting down trees along the DMZ under heavy security after North Korean border guards murdered U.S. Army Captain Arthur Bonifas and 1st Lieutenant Mark Barrett with their own axes when they initially attempted to remove one single poplar tree that was blocking their observation post. This infamous event has since become known as the Panmunjom axe murder incident . The two Korean leaders then crossed a small a footbridge, which South Korean officials had painted in the symbolic blue representing future reunification, and walked along the DMZ. They eventually spent an unprecedented 30 minutes speaking effectively alone without any other advisers or aides. There was then a banquet with more speeches and specially prepared North and South Korean dishes, as well as a concert before Kim departed and returned to the North. Kim, left, and Moon together., AP As the jam-packed day of meetings and events came closer to its conclusion, the two sides had also revealed they had signed a multi-part declaration, which you can read in full below: The call for an end to the Korean War is significant, as the two sides remain technically at war after 65 years. An armistice officially ended the outright fighting in 1953, though clashes and other violent alterations have continued ever since, but there is no peace treaty to bring the conflict to an end. But there could be significant hurdles in achieving that goal, not least of which that it would more formally establish two independent Koreas and push the possibility of reunification, long a goal of both sides, indefinitely into the future. Various foreign parties, most notably the United States, would also have to agree to rescind a number of United Nations Security Council resolutions that provide an international mandate to maintain a military presence on the Peninsula to deter North Korean aggression. The U.S. government is a permanent member of the Security Council and can veto any new resolution unilaterally for any reason. Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ro Sol Ju, at left, share a toast with Moon Jae In and his wife Kim Jung Sook at a banquet marking the end of the April 2018 summit., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP “We are not a people that should be confronting each other … we should be living in unity,” Kim said. “We have long waited for this moment to happen. All of us.” “The road I have used today, I sincerely hope every South and North Korean citizen can use this road,” Kim continued. “We will be able to enjoy peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula without having to fear the war.” He did not specifically mention denuclearization in his prepared remarks, but Moon later said both sides had agreed to completely denuclearization the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether or not the two sides agree on the definition of denuclearization, which North Korea has long called for, but clearly understands does not include giving up its own nuclear arsenal, at least without massive concessions. Instead, the North Korean regime has typically understood this to mean the removal of the threat of U.S. nuclear strikes, which would involve ending agreements that put South Korea, as well as nearby Japan, under America’s deterrent umbrella. This, along with plans to “end” the Korean War, are almost certainly linked to the border desire on the part of the government in Pyongyang to eliminate the raison d’être for American troops to remain on the Peninsula at all. As such, the goal to “completely cease all hostile acts against each other in every domain,” could be equally hard to turn into a reality, especially since this would almost certainly mean an end to shared U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which North Korea repeatedly insists are simply dry runs for an invasion. Coupled with Kim’s proposed freeze on missile and nuclear weapons testing, South Korea’s pledge to halt propaganda broadcasts and leaflet drops across the border, as well as plans to turn the West Sea – the site of numerous violent clashes over the years, which have led to the deaths of South Korean military personnel and innocent civilians – into a neutral economic zone, could have more immediate effects on reducing tensions. “[I] won’t interrupt your early morning sleep anymore,” Kim reportedly joked with Moon, referring to his recent flurry of ballistic missile tests, including the demonstration of a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile . Moon, at right, touches a rusted sign marking the DMZ that separates South Korea from the North, a stark reminder of the continued conflict between the two and how long it has been going on., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP Calls for improving the ability for divided families to meet and otherwise communicate, as well as increased economic and other cooperation, such as a potential joint participation in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia, which start in August 2018, are hardly new concepts. The closure of a shared industrial park and a halt in scheduling new family visits were among the first casualties of the latest burst of heightened tensions on the Peninsula. It is also worth noting that this meeting, likely the first in a series, did not address North Korea’s gross human rights violations , the country’s illicit economic activities , or the assassination of Kim’s half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in February 2017. Despite all the smiles and laughter, it’s impossible for these issues not to come up eventually and protesters flocked to the South Korean side to denounce Moon’s decision to meet with Kim. It’s not the first time leaders from both sides have met, either. South Korean Presidents Kim Dea Jung and Roh Moo Hyun both met with Kim’s father Kim Jong Il, in 2000 and 2007, respectively, without any meaning progress come from those engagements. Both of those events occurred in Pyongyang, though, which could indicate both parties believe this time might be different. Kim, left, and Moon embrace., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP None of this is to say that the meeting doesn’t appear to be a largely positive step in intra-Korean relations and for reducing the likelihood of a catastrophic conflict on the Peninsula. As The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway previously wrote after Kim announced his missile and nuclear testing moratorium: Some will say North Korea has made agreements and broken them before.  That’s true, but the immediate threat of snap-back sanctions and a  preemptive strike is a powerful tool now on the table. Additionally, Kim Jong Un is not his father or his grandfather. He has been remarkably open about his intentions and capabilities, and if he gets a taste of even granular respect on the world stage, it could lead to real reforms. Also keep in mind the drastically different relationship the North has with the South now after just a couple months of talks. For Kim to backtrack on all this just to test nuclear bombs and launch rockets,  while also sending his economy back into a death spiral, seems totally illogical. … So the fact that Kim’s star is rising on the world stage, and he seems to really like this fact, is a good development that can be readily exploited. In essence, his increasing connection with the greater world community is the most probable catalyst that could bring about a major change on the Korean Peninsula. This critical observation needs to be carefully factored into the aims of Trump-Kim summit. By providing him a series of stepping stones where his ego won’t be obliterated in the process of stepping away from his nuclear stockpile, it may actually happen. He can first claim a strategic win for his people, saying his goals of achieving a nuclear deterrent are achieved, and then once trust is built with external parties, he can be offered an incredibly lucrative opportunity to usher his people into a new age. Kim, left, and Moon briefly cross into North Korea together, before coming back to the South at the very beginning of their summit., Korea Summit Press Pool/Sipa via AP The same goes for this summit, as well as the still reportedly forthcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim. After the meeting Trump took to his favorite outlet, Twitter, to declare the Korean War was set to end, which remains to be seen, as well as applaud the work of China, North Korea’s principal foreign ally, in pushing for the talks. “Disasters are never powerful enough to separate real brothers, and a smile is all they need to eliminate the hard feelings,” China’s foreign ministry said in its own statement, citing an ancient Chinese poem. How Trump’s summit might go could also have serious ramifications, especially if the United States demands immediate and total denuclearization as it defines it, which is likely to be the total and verifiable elimination of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and infrastructure and raw materials to produce additional devices. Not only is that likely to be a non-starter for North Korea, it could also be near impossible to ensure the North Koreans are complying. If those talks break down, it could prompt a more serious divergence in policy between the South Korean and American governments over how to handle the situation. The U.S. government was initially dismissive of the possibility of productive talks between Moon and Kim, stressing that it was under no obligation to abide by any terms the two Koreas set for themselves. North Korea is very likely to treat this summit, like the lowered tensions leading up to the summit, as a major victory that validates the legitimacy of their state, as well as the regime’s decision to pursue a nuclear deterrent seemingly at all costs. North Korea’s state television pointedly did not broadcast the event live, unlike South Korean and Chinese outlets. This could be due to technical limitations, but at the time of writing, the Korean Central News Agency had yet to issue any commentary either. North Korea’s heavily scripted state media is likely poring over exactly how to frame the summit domestically to a populace that is routinely told that the South Korean government is a vicious enemy and puppet of the United States. All told, it is still too early to say for sure how well the two Koreas will be able to implement the tenets of their joint declaration and how long those initiatives might last. At the same time, it is undoubtedly a positive that the two sides decided to choose diplomacy and significant gestures toward stability and ultimate peace, over the inflammatory rhetoric that has been predominant on all sides over the past 18 months and a potentially devastating all-out conflict.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Lankford (R-OK), Tillis (R-NC), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) would prevent the transfer of F-35s to Turkey and keep the country from establishing a maintenance depot for the stealth fighters. Turkey has been one of six prime F-35 partner nations since 2002 and one of its biggest customers, with 116 of the stealth fighters on order. Under this legislation, the White House would to certify that Ankara isn’t working to degrade NATO interoperability, exposing NATO assets to hostile actors, degrading the security of NATO member countries, seeking to import weapons from a foreign country under sanction by the U.S., and wrongfully or unlawfully detaining any American citizens. The bill reads: U.S. Senate Bill Senator Lankford said the following in an official statement regarding the reasoning behind the bill: “Senators Shaheen and Tillis have worked diligently with me and others in Congress to address America’s rapidly deteriorating relationship with Turkey… I applaud our State Department for their ceaseless work to improve the US-Turkey relationship, but President Erdogan has continued down a path of reckless governance and disregard for the rule of law. Individual freedoms have been increasingly diminished as Erdogan consolidates power for himself, and Turkey’s strategic decisions regrettably fall more and more out of line with, and at times in contrast to, US interests. These factors make the transfer of sensitive F-35 technology and cutting-edge capabilities to Erdogan’s regime increasingly risky. Furthermore, the Turkish government continues to move closer and closer to Russia, as they hold an innocent American pastor, Andrew Brunson, in prison to use him as a pawn in political negotiations. The United States does not reward hostage-taking of American citizens; such action instead will be met with the kind of punitive measures this bill would enact.” Though not specifically stated, the first four points deal almost entirely with Turkey’s planned purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Since 2015, the Turkish military has been looking to purchase a new, long-range SAM to replace a number of aging Cold War-era systems it still has in service. That year, a previous plan to buy Chinese FD-2000s collapsed amid pressure from the United States and other NATO members for many of the reasons Lankford and Shaheen cite in their proposed legislation. You can read more about that saga in detail here . But in 2017, Turkey announced it had signed a contract with Russia to buy the S-400s, with an eye toward some level of domestic industrial cooperation or co-production, which had always been a major secondary goal for the deal. As they had when Turkish authorities said they were going to buy the Chinese weapons, the United States and other NATO members expressed their dismay over the plan, saying that the Russian systems wouldn’t work with the alliances networks and other constructs and that they could risk exposing sensitive information to the Kremlin. Concerns about the potential of Moscow gaining information about the F-35 and how the S-400 performs against it have only grown since then, especially after Turkey stated that it would seek to fully integrate the F-35 with the rest of its own military networks. Components of the S-400 air defense system., AP Unlike in 2015, though, Turkey, and in particular its President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have been defiant and insisted that the S-400 deal will go ahead no matter what. The Turkish president has specifically stated that there is a double standard at play since Greece already owns and operates older Russian S-300PMU surface-to-air missile systems. However, Greece is not part of the F-35 program and only ended up with those weapons as part of a deal to allay Turkish concerns about Cyprus’ military capabilities. Cyprus, which is not a NATO member, has been in the middle of a conflict between Greece and Turkey since 1974, when ethnic Greek Cypriots staged a coup, prompting Turkey to invade ostensibly to protect the island’s ethnic Turkish minority, leaving it partially divided to this day. When Cyprus purchased the S-300s in 1997, Turkey threatened a military strike to destroy them. The Greek government then stepped in and took them in a swap for other air defense systems that Turkey saw as less threatening to its interests. It’s true that Greece has been looking to either upgrade these systems or potentially purchase newer versions, such as the S-400, from Russia for more than a decade, but there has been no real movement in that regard as of yet. Otherwise, Turkey’s relations with the United States had already been strained following a coup attempt in 2016 . Erdoğan blamed former political ally and Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen of masterminding the plot, though he has yet to provide any firm evidence of this. Gülen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the United States, is an outspoken critic of the Turkish leader’s increasingly authoritarian tendencies. The United States has refused to extradite him to stand trial in Turkey until the government there provides substantive evidence to support its claims. Turkey is the world’s third-largest F-16 operator and has benefitted from an incredibly tight relationship with the U.S. military over the decades. , AP In response, Erdoğan has sought to increase ties America’s traditional opponents in the region, including Russia and Iran, and has openly threatened American troops in neighboring Syria over their support for Kurdish groups that the Turkish government sees as terrorists. The Turkish president himself has accused the U.S. military of running a “terror Army” and has launched unilateral intervention into northwestern Syria in January 2018 against the expressed wishes of the U.S. government. The United States, in turn, says Turkey’s actions have drawn attention away from fighting ISIS terrorists at a critical moment, which appears to have given the group space to regroup. This could also be seen as a reason for Lankford and Shaheen to suggest Turkish authorities may be “degrading the general security of NATO member countries,” many of whom have seen ISIS sympathizers return from fighting in Iraq and Syria or have suffered outright ISIS-inspired terror attacks on their soil. The last point has to do with Turkey’s arrest of Andrew Brunson , an American evangelical Presbyterian minister, who has lived and worked in Turkey for more than two decades, on charges of espionage and attempting to overthrow the government. Turkish officials detained him as part of a massive crackdown following the 2016 coup attempt that saw thousands of Turkish citizens expelled from public service. Many of those individuals subsequent faced arrest for various charges. Not surprisingly, Erdoğan has offered to exchange Brunson for Gülen. Trump and Erdogan have remained close even while the strong bonds between the two NATO allies continue to erode. , AP With all this in mind, there have been repeated calls for stopping the export of the F-35 to Turkey and for the U.S. to pull its tactical nuclear weapons out of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, but this is the first time those calls have morphed into legislation. It will be interesting to see how the Trump administration, which has retained relatively close ties with Erdogan since coming into office, and Turkey itself reacts to the bill. But considering Turkey has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the F-35 program, has billions in industrial offsets tied up in the deal, and has been molding its future air power strategy around it, it’s safe to say that the move will make some serious diplomatic waves. Maybe the biggest take away from this development is that it is yet another signal that the long-held relationship, even on a military level, between the U.S. and Turkey is eroding at an increasing rate. What that means for the NATO alliance and the region as a whole is still yet to be fully understood.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israeli firm Plasan has unveiled a new battle buggy that it says has armor that can brush off high-powered rifle bullets without any significant loss of speed or mobility. The company is pitching the design, called the Yagu, primarily for border patrol and other law enforcement duties in remote areas, but it could also offer a better protected, lightweight vehicle for certain conventional military and special operations forces . Earlier in April 2018, Plasan unveiled the Yagu at the Expo Seguridad 2018 exhibition in Mexico City. That the venue was in Mexico, which continues to grapple with border security and drug, human, and other trafficking challenges, helps explain the marketing focus on Yagu as a tool in combating that kind of criminality. “Nothing this light and agile ever offered so much protection for a 3-man crew,” the company posted on Twitter after the vehicle’s debut. “Lay chase, maintain the element of surprise. Yagu is your new weapon against trafficking. Your borders will never have been so secure.” But many of the Yagu’s other optional features point to its potential utility in military missions, as well. At its core, the buggy is a modified Arctic Cat Wildcat 4x 1000 all-terrain vehicle. It uses the same 95-horsepower engine and automatic transmission, which has the same ability to switch between two and four-wheel drive modes, as the Wildcat. On top of that, though, Plasan, a specialized in vehicle armoring and composites, has added a new lightweight armored shell with bullet-resistant front and side windows. The company says this provides B6+ level protection on all sides for the crew of three, though an auxiliary power unit and air conditioning system are both exposed at the rear. A European standard, B6 type armor can stop many high-powered rifle rounds, such as the NATO-standard 5.56x45mm and the ever popular Soviet-era 7.62x39mm . The “+” suggests that Plasan’s protective suite should be able to defeat more powerful cartridges, such as the NATO 7.62x51mm and the Soviet-designed 7.62x54mmR , but only if they don’t have special armor-piercing bullets. Plasan Typically this level of protection requires ballistic steel at least a third of an inch thick, which can greatly increase a vehicle’s weight. With the composite armored box, Plasan says Yagu has a curb weight of just over 3,300 pounds, more than twice that of the standard Wildcat. But this would make it lighter than General Dynamics Flyer 72 , especially with its add-on armor packages, but heavier than Polaris’ MRZR all-terrain vehicle, both of which are in service with U.S. conventional and special operations forces. It’s not clear if that weight figure includes an optional remote weapon station or small drone launching system, which are both options that Plasan has heavily emphasized in the marketing literature. The promotional version also has flashing lights and a siren for law-enforcement duties, but could just as easily accommodate small electro-optical or infrared cameras and other sensors and missions systems for military use. Yagu with its onboard drone in flight., Plasan The remotely-operated weapon system on the Yagu prototype can accommodate either a 5.56x45mm Israel Weapon Industries Negev squad automatic weapon or a 7.62x51mm FN MAG-type light machine gun. It is likely that it will be able to accept other similarly sized weapons, such as the FN M249 squad automatic weapon, but does not appear suited to larger machine guns or automatic grenade launchers. The unmanned aircraft, a small quad-copter type design, can reportedly fly for nearly 30 minutes at a time and has a full-motion video feed that it sends back to an operator inside the Yagu. A promotional video shows it operating both independently of the vehicle and physically tethered to it using a retractable cable. In this latter mode, it would function similarly to an extendable sensor mast , but without the weight and bulk necessary for that type of system. A rear shot of the Yagu showing its exposed auxiliary power unit and air conditioner., Plasan All of these features could make Yagu a useful and low-cost option to border patrol or other law enforcement missions in austere locations where there is an increased threat of particularly well armed and organized criminals. The drone would give the crew the ability to monitor a much broader area than they might otherwise be able to do with more typical mounted or handheld optics. But they would also appear to offer an attractive alternative for conventional military and special operations forces who are looking for the mobility and payload capacity an all-terrain vehicle might offer, but with some modicum of protection. A report from Marine Corps Times in January 2018 said that U.S. Marine Corps special operators were particularly displeased with their MRZRs. The MRZR does offer added mobility for light forces and has a better payload capacity than smaller all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles . However, it has no ballistic protection whatsoever and therefore has limited utility for missions where there might be the risk of personnel finding themselves in a serious firefight. A variety of US special operations vehicles near the garrison at At Tanf , Syria. In front is an MRZR and at right is a Flyer 72. The other two vehicles are Humvee-based Ground Mobility Vehicles., US Army “I’m sure they use it a lot in noncombat advisory roles in Africa,” an anonymous Marine told Marine Corps Times. “[But] getting a foot outside the wire in Iraq took an act of God, so tactical golf carts wouldn’t cut it.” Later that month, The War Zone was among the first to report that U.S. Special Operations Command was urgently looking for more firepower and defenses for Flyer 72 vehicles that various special operations forces units are already using in combat zones. There are also concerns that these vehicles may not be as readily air-transportable, especially inside CH-47 and MH-47 Chinook and CH-53 Sea Stallion-type helicopters and V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, as originally advertised. Conventional U.S. Army airborne units are slated to get these same vehicles later in 2018 , while light infantry units will start receiving them in 2019. These same units, as well as conventional Marine elements, are also exploring the expanded use of MRZR-sized all-terrain vehicles. In March 2018, Marines experimented with Nikola Motor Company ’s electric-powered Reckless 4×4 all-terrain vehicle, which is similar in size to the Arctic Cat Wildcat, during a broader test. The prototype military variant also featured a remotely operated weapon station with a 7.62x51mm machine gun, but no armor protection. Marines test a Nikola Motor Company Reckless all-terrain vehicle during a broader evaluation of new technologies in March 2018., USMC Plasan could easily pitch Yagu to the U.S. military, as well as other military and para-military organizations, as an alternative to MRZRs or similar unarmored all-terrain vehicles. Its new design could also provide a more practical option for missions requiring a more robust internally-transportable vehicle that is easier to load on and off helicopters and Ospreys than the Flyer 72. This could be even more of an issue if the added weight of new weapon mounts and armor weigh those vehicles down and make them harder to transport and less mobile over certain terrain. Of course, Yagu still lacks the kind of protection necessary to survive against an enemy with heavy weapons, such as large-caliber machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, and would almost certainly suffer badly at the hands of roadside bombs. Additional lightweight protective suites, such as high-tensile netting that can deflect or pre-detonate incoming anti-tank rockets, or small active protection systems , might help mitigate some of those issues, but at the cost of added weight and bulk. Plasan/Nir Kahn It is also possible that Plasan could use the same composite armor technology it has developed for Yagu to craft other lightweight armor solutions for other existing platforms, such as the MRZR or Flyer 72. The existing armored shell concept would already seem readily adaptable to any multi-occupant all-terrain vehicle. And above all else, the Yagu looks like it’s ripped right out of a science fiction movie, which may help with its grander appeal to tech-obsessed services. As our own Tyler Rogoway put it “it looks like the ‘Tumbler’ Batmobile from the Dark Knight movie series did it with a golf cart and this popped out nine months later.” Considering the popularity of those films, that probably isn’t a bad thing.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 9, 2017",Navy Could Extend The Life Of USS Nimitz Past 50 Years To Maintain 12 Carrier Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy has been struggling to find ways to bolster its carrier force. This even briefly included looking at returning USS Kitty Hawk , which has been retired for a decade, to service. Now the Navy is being directed to investigate the possibility of extending the life of USS Nimitz —the namesake of the Navy’s current fleet made up entirely of Nimitz class carriers—beyond its 50-year lifespan. If such an effort is found feasible and relatively affordable, it could potentially lead to other Nimitz class carrier service life extensions. The always great Seapowermagazine.org posted a report detailing a markup of the National Defense Authorization Act by the Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. Part of the changes include executing a multi-carrier buy to save on the Ford class carriers’ atrocious unit cost, and requiring the Navy to study what it would take to extend the life of USS Nimitz which is slated to be retired in 2023, stating: “With the delivery of the USS John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) in 2023, the Navy will reach their 12 aircraft carrier goal but will quickly lose this overall capacity with the programmed retirement of USS Nimitz (CVN 68) in fiscal year 2023,” the markup said. “The committee believes that there are several options to retain required aircraft carrier force structure to include accelerating construction of the Ford -class carriers. Additionally, the committee believes that service life extension options may be available for USS Nimitz . Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a briefing to the House Committee on Armed Services by March 1, 2019, on options that exist to extend the service life of USS Nimitz, to include the extension of major components. Additionally, such a briefing should include cost estimates and major modernization components.” Nimitz in drydock in 2011., USN It’s somewhat surprising that such a study hasn’t already been done. Regardless, squeezing some extra life out of America’s supercarrier fleet could result in a windfall of savings, even if it extends the life of each ship five to ten years. Currently, the Navy has 11 supercarriers in its fleet. The retirement of USS Enterprise (CVN-65) in 2012 caused the mandated 12 carrier force to drop by one ship. President Trump has since stated that he wants a 12 supercarrier force, but achieving an increase of just one ship presents a huge challenge for the Navy. Keeping Nimitz, the Navy’s next carrier to retire, operational could be especially important as the Ford class carrier program remains riddled with technological issues that could drastically delay their introduction into service. Similar service life extension initiatives are being eyed by the Navy for its surface combatant fleet as part of the service’s attempt to realize a 355 ship fleet in the decades to come. In fact, just last week the Navy made it clear that it plans to extend the life of its entire Arleigh Burke class destroyer fleet, with each ship going from roughly 35 to 45 years of service. The Navy isn’t really assigning a cost to this policy change just yet though. USNI News quoted Vice Admiral Bill Merz as stating: “There’s no specific modernization or maintenance period that goes with that, so I don’t want to say they’re free, because you still have to man them and operate them, but unlike an individual ship where you’ve got to put it in the yard and you’ve got to do all these upgrades, we’re doing this based on the performance of the class. So all of them are just, from an engineering analysis, extended based on their past performance. If we have to modernize beyond that then we’ll have to learn how to pay for that.” This plan will cost extra money though, as these vessels will need upgrades and more time in drydock—which are not in great supply as it is—and will cost more to operate than their younger stablemates. But still, it’s a good sign that the Navy is trying to squeeze more out of the ships it already has instead of reaching right for big shipbuilding dollars to solve its problems. It’s also worth noting that the Navy is just beginning to start-up a cruiser replacement program, which we got a tiny glimpse of recently. But it will be many years before such a vessel is ready to take even part of the aging Ticonderoga class’s place. With this in mind, pouring sufficient funds into existing ships to keep them ready and relevant will be critical to the Navy’s ability to project power for the foreseeable future. For a long time, the service seemed incredibly averse to investing in its older platforms, instead pushing near myopically to buy new ships. But this was a fiscally unsustainable and even dangerous strategy and it’s good that it’s being finally seen as such. The Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers are the heart of the surface warfare fleet and must be adequately funded to keep them safe, reliable, and relevant.  , USN Also of interest in Seapower’s breakdown of the markup was the requirement for the “Secretary of the Navy to procure the data rights to the new guided-missile frigate and recompete the frigate not later than the contract award of the 10th frigate.” This seems to mean that a new shipyard, or possibly even a new consortium, could take over building the Navy’s new FFG(X) guided-missile frigate after the first ten are built or contracted. FFG(X) is based on one of five existing designs , three or four of which are foreign (depending on how you count them), so the Navy would need to own the intellectual property of the design in order to allow others to bid on building additional hulls.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 19, 2018",The Pentagon Wants To Stop Marauding Vehicles With High-Powered Microwave Beams,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Extremists and militants around the world are increasingly turning to suicide car bombs , as well as unmodified vehicles , for terrorist attacks and killing sprees both on the battlefield and regular city streets. Now, the U.S. military hopes it is getting close to crafting a practical radio frequency jammer that might be able to stop those threats dead in their tracks with high-powered microwaves . The Pentagon’s central less-than-lethal weapon office, called the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ), is in charge of the project, which it formally refers to the Radio Frequency Vehicle Stopper (RFVS). Though the concept dates back even further than that, the U.S. military has been actively working on the program since at least 2007 and the goal is to demonstrate a relatively portable prototype suitable for actual operations by the end of 2019. Scientists and engineers have already used experimental versions to demonstrate how the system works, at least in principle, against vehicles on land and small boats. “Anything that has electronics on it, these high-powered microwaves will affect,” David Law, head of the JNLWD Technology Division, told Defense One in March. “As long as the [microwave beam] is on [target], it holds the vehicle stopped.” At its most basic, the concept is fairly simple. An array of microwave emitters shoots out a beam of energy that jams electronic devices, such as the control unit in an engine, effectively shutting it down. https://youtube.com/watch?v=H-tNhWSLufA At present, Law’s team is working on two variants, one for “force protection” and another for “force application.” Both are not supposed to harm a vehicle’s occupants in any way. The force application type is small enough to fit on the back of a truck and could be used to stop a fleeing vehicle or to defend convoys on the move. This could also be useful for law enforcement personnel attempting to stop a specific suspect vehicle or a small smuggling boat . JNLWD says the present prototype of this system has an effective range of approximately 160 feet, according to Defense One. The force protection version is larger and supposed to defend static sites, such as checkpoints and base entry points, against car and truck bombs and similar threats. With added power and a larger microwave array, it reportedly has more than twice the range of the mobile type. It’s not clear just how big either RFVS system is. A 2016 briefing we at The War Zone obtained said the goal was for the final force protection design to be around 4,000 pounds and fit into 200 square foot area, while the force application type would be half that weight and quarter the overall size. This briefing slide from 2016 gives details on the RFVS program at that time and plans for the future., USN via FOIA Law told Defense One that the fixed system is, at least in its present form, three times larger than the mobile one. A model of the force application system that Defense One observed looks very similar to one called the RF Safe Stop from a company in the United Kingdom called Teledyne E2V, which weighs around 780 pounds , which could mean JNLWD’s larger system is less than 2,500 pounds. If so, that would represent a significant reduction in its overall weight in the past two years. If JNLWD Technology Division can come up with a functional prototype, the benefits are clear. The microwave beam would be a much more capable and flexible option than existing vehicle stopping equipment. These systems, such as spike strips , caltrops , and portable nets and barriers, don’t always produce uniform results depending on the size of the vehicle and its speed. Personnel often have to reset them after a single vehicle passes over or through them. The video below shows personnel from the North Dakota Army National Guard’s 191st Military Police Company testing a Portable Vehicle Arresting Barrier (PVAB). With its high-power microwave, the RFVS would be better able to stop a vehicle and keep it immobilized regardless of how big it is or how fast it’s moving, so long as the individual manning it can keep the beam on the target. A more automated system, with cueing from electro-optical, infrared, or other sensors would be even more capable and might be more quickly able to shift focus from one target to another. This latter functionality would be especially important in dealing with complex multi-vehicle attacks in which there might be decoys to distract from the most pressing threat, such a large truck bomb. In addition, unlike the other presently available options, the system JNLWD is working on does not run the risk of causing any permanent damage. This means that if troops or law enforcement make a mistake in employing the final RFVS in the future, they will not have accidentally destroyed private property, or worse . With this in mind, police, border guards, or similar security personnel might be able to eventually employ a smaller version with more localized effects to hold cars in place during routine traffic stops or at checkpoints and then release them afterward. As of 2016, the JNLWD was also working on exactly this kind of system, called the Pre-Emplaced Electrical Vehicle Stopper (PEVS), which it described as a sort of electronic “speed bump.” Using highly localized pulses of microwave energy instead of a constant beam, it could target single vehicles or small groups of mobile threats, but would not necessarily be able to hold them in place indefinitely. Another slide from the 2016 briefing showing other non-lethal weapon demonstrators, including the PEVS., USN via FOIA But there are still hurdles for Law and his team to overcome before any version of the RFVS, or similar system, is ready for operational use. The biggest remaining impediment, according to Defense One, is power. It takes a lot of energy to run a suitably powerful microwave beam continuously for an extended period of time. In September 2018, JNLWD expects to take delivery of a 400-pound, 300-kilowatt generator from Candent Technologies. Previously the RFVS had to use generators weighing thousands of pounds, which helps explain why the original laboratory demonstrators had a total weight of nearly 10,000 pounds. The system will also need additional features to help keep everything cool and there have been plans to develop smaller microwave emitter arrays to reduce both size and weight even further while maintaining the desired effective range. Perhaps more problematically, the RFVS concept does nothing to stop a vehicle’s momentum, meaning that an incoming vehicular threat could keep rolling toward its target even after the engine cuts out. A shipping container-sized RFVS demonstrator from circa 2011-2012., JNLWD There are more nuanced issues, as well. High powered microwaves can destroy electronics if the beam is powerful enough. This means JNLWD will have to take steps to ensure the system produces a steady stream of energy at the appropriate power level no matter what the range and in spite of smoke, dust, or other particulate matter in the air that might cause the waves to fluctuate. There also might be an unavoidable risk to occupants with pacemakers or other electronic medical implants. Otherwise, it is possible that anyone employing a production RFVS might inadvertently destroy a vehicle. The possibility of doing so, or even the perception that it might be possible for this to happen, could create a reluctance to actually use it for fear of something going wrong. Very firm rules of engagement might help mitigate those concerns. Of course, with variable power controls, the system might be more multi-purpose, able to act as a short-range air defense or active protection system that could disrupt or destroy the fuzes or guidance systems on incoming missiles and rockets or vital electronics on small unmanned aircraft. JNLWD itself has previously posited that a variant of the RFVS might have the ability to destroy the fuzing systems on car and truck bombs or even pre-detonate them before they got close to their targets. BAE Systems is already pitching a more powerful high-powered microwave system as a close-in self-defense weapon system for ships. Boeing has delivered a number of Counter-Electronics High-Power Advanced Microwave Project ( CHAMP ) missiles to the U.S. Air Force as a stand-off means of knocking out enemy command and control, communications, and air defense nodes. The Air Force and Navy are presently working together on the secretive High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike ( HiJENKS ) program and there have also been reports over the years that suggest there are more exotic, possibly operational high power mircowave weapons in the classified realm . But even with the ability to fine-tune the power levels and the size of the beam, the system may not be precise enough to use in near large groups of innocent bystanders without the risk of unintended effects to civilians or friendly forces. Especially in a densely packed urban area, such as a sprawling “ megacity ,” an environment where conflicts are increasingly likely to occur as time goes on, it might be difficult to single out a threat. Any other electronics caught between the emitter and that target would also experience a disruption. So, depending on the vector of the attack and the position of the RFVS relative to other friendly positions, turning it on could risk knocking out communications or other systems at a critical moment. Similar problems would quickly become apparent in any attempt to transition the technology to law enforcement use, even though it could potentially be of great use in defending against vehicular terrorist attacks, such as the one that just occurred in Toronto, Canada on April 23, 2018. Police forces would only be under even greater scrutiny to avoid damaging private property, somehow causing injuries or death directly or indirectly, or just inconveniencing members of the general public with blasts of electronics disabling microwave energy. When it comes to using the U.S. military using the system in a force protection role, the plan is already for any final RFVS design to be part of a layered concept that includes other non-lethal and lethal weapons, which could help mitigate some of these limitations. But it remains to be seen if, after more than a decade of development, the high-powered microwave beam can be a truly useful addition to that defensive arsenal.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 6, 2018",Shedding Some Light On The Air Force’s Most Shadowy Drone Squadron,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the U.S. Air Force’s most secretive drone squadron appears to have been hiding, at least in part, in plain sight for at least five years. Following an in-depth investigation, including official statements and information we previously obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, we at The War Zone can now provide an exclusive and unprecedented look at what is now known as the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron and offer insight as to what tasks the shadowy unit might be performing today The 44th Reconnaissance Squadron officially stood up at Creech Air Force Base on April 1, 2015. At that time, it joined the 732nd Operations Group, part of the Air Force’s main drone unit, the 432nd Wing, which also calls the base located north of Las Vegas in Indian Springs, Nevada home. USAF This squadron and its predecessors likely represent yet another previously missing link in the evolution of advanced unmanned aircraft capable of penetrating contested airspace and persisting there for extended periods of time. Origins of the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron Before 2015, the unit had not been active since 1946, when it was known as the 430th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy. The organization flew B-29 bombers over Japan during the latter stages of the Second World War. But the unit as it exists today actually dates back to at least Feb. 21, 2013, with the creation of 732nd Operations Group, Detachment 1 headquartered at Creech AFB . An RQ-170 derivative seen at Andersen AFB on the island of Guam., USAF obtained via FOIA In October 2017, an image of what appears to be an unofficial morale patch for 732nd’s Detachment 1 appeared on social media. After further investigation, the same patch was for sale online from various outlets. The logo features a silhouette of the stealthy and still highly classified RQ-170 Sentinel , along with an inverted sword, a red lightning bolt, three red drops of blood, and the motto “Forging The Sword.” Flightlineinsignia.com On top of that silhouette is a blackbird in the exact same style as the one on the official insignia of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron. This is another unit assigned to the 732nd Operations Group and the only one the Air Force has ever publicly acknowledged as flying the stealthy RQ-170. 30th RS is the only unit the USAF has disclosed as flying the RQ-170 Sentinel. The squadron clearly has direct ties with the 44th RS and the detachment that preceded its establishment., USAF In a phone conversation with The War Zone, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron still does fly the batwing RQ-170 drone . They, along with other public affairs officers, declined to offer any details about Detachment 1’s activities and would not confirm or deny whether it did indeed fly the RQ-170 for a time, as well. Another cryptic crest of the 732nd OG Detachment 1. , Flightlineinsignia.com However, the fact that the Air Force created a subdivision of the unit in the exact same location as its main headquarters is already a significant detail. In the Air Force, detachments are usually groups of individuals tasked with overseeing a particular subset of a unit’s activities, but very often they exist because that work is occurring at a physically separate, tertiary site. The existence of a detachment can also indicate the presence of a highly specialized subdivision of a particular unit or a somewhat larger force that is tasked with remote operations at a separate facility, for one reason or another. Secretive Detachments Though detachments often perform mundane tasks, there are many examples of the Air Force using this arrangement with regards to testing or operating clandestine platforms. For instance, in 1992, the Air Force shut down the “Red Hats” of the 6513th Test Squadron, which secretly conducted technical evaluations of various captured foreign aircraft at the remote Tonopah Test Range Airport . It transformed its remaining elements into 413th Test Squadron, Detachment 3, which reportedly continued that work at Groom Lake , better known as Area 51 , until 2004 and likely beyond that date in one fashion or another. A similar thing happened to the equally secret “Red Eagles” of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron, which actually flew foreign combat aircraft from Area 51 until 1990, at which time a portion of the unit became 53rd Test and Evaluation Group, Detachment 3. That unit, officially situated at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada but operating out of Area 51, continues to be responsible for “foreign materiel exploitation” to this day and is likely combined with the remnants of the Red Hats to some degree. The F-117 Nighthawk’s development and early operational fielding were also associated with a detachment that worked to test the aircraft and get its initial pilot cadre into the air. F-117a.com states : “The current day 410th Flight Test Squadron traces its history to the formation of the SENIOR TREND Joint (later Combined) Test Force. (Detachment 2, R unit) The unit was established in 1980 as joint test force of Lockheed and Air Force personnel at Groom Lake, Nevada… This acceptance test squadron had no name operated at Groom in the early days. The Baja Scorpion was quickly adopted as the symbol of the Lockheed-USAF development effort. The scorpion symbol is the symbol of all F-117A testing. Both the Baja Scorpions and the Dragon Test Team mark their aircraft with the Scorpion. In 1989, the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing replaced the secretive 4450th Tactical Group, which had previously flown the F-117 out of the Tonopah Test Range Airport. That top secret unit was officially based at Nellis Air Force Base. It had its own Detachment 1 for a time at Tonopah, which subsequently transformed into the 4452nd Test Squadron, another example of how detachments can help conceal larger units performing classified activities. The USAF’s testing operations at the secretive Area 51 are run by the Air Force Flight Test Center’s Detachment 3. The main body of that unit is situated at Edwards Air Force Base. More closely related to the story at hand, in 2011, the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron created its own physically separate Detachment 1 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Sentinels had been spotted flying out of the base in the years that followed, and a specially configured RQ-170 appeared at that base in 2017, a story that The War Zone broke . April Fools’ Day 2015 While we don’t have an official description of its activities, we do know that the 732nd’s Detachment 1 ceased to exist at Creech AFB on April 1, 2015. That exact same day the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron came into existence at the base. We also have strong indications that this entire arrangement existed as a public parallel to an unacknowledged drone effort, likely at somewhere other than Creech Air Force Base, or as an outright cover for that work. For one, squadrons are usually larger units than detachments, indicating that while it may have absorbed the previous detachment, it also almost certainly added additional personnel and likely more aircraft on top of its original structure. And there is some evidence to suggest these added resources came from a unit already operating in secret. USAF The 732nd Operations Group’s official insignia features five triangular “deltas.” These “represent the original five squadrons of the group as well as denote the unit’s flying spirit and its overarching values of innovation and excellence,” according to a formal description we obtained from the Air Force Historical Research Agency. The issue here is that when the Air Force created the 732nd Operations Group in 2012, the only publicly assigned units were the 17th, 22nd, 30th, and 867th Reconnaissance Squadrons – at that time all but the 30th were officially flying MQ-1 Predators or MQ-9 Reapers. When the service approved the unit’s logo in 2014 that was still the case. Even the official internal histories of Air Combat Command, which oversees the entire 432nd Wing – documents that the Air Force previously classified as secret, which we obtained via the Freedom of Information Act – do not mention the fifth squadron in the years before the establishment of the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron. A “missing” squadron It is possible that this fifth delta could represent Detachment 1, but it seems unlikely since it specifically says “squadrons” and does not make a reference to the unit’s headquarters. The 732nd Operations Group did not exist in any form prior to 2012 so it cannot be a call back to a previous incarnation of the unit, either. This reference to an apparently “missing” squadron also came after the somewhat curious decision to move the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron from the more remote and secretive Tonopah Test Range Airport to Creech Air Force Base proper in 2011. We had long assumed that this unit continued to operate all of the USAF’s estimated 20 to 30 RQ-170s, but this may not have been the case. A recent patch showing all five of the 732nd OG’s assigned squadrons. , Aviatorgear.com Other morale patches available online point to the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron continuing on from 732nd Operations Group Detachment 1 and operating at least some of the Sentinels. Of course, it could just as easily operate other still classified unmanned aircraft, including derivatives of the RQ-170, or a mixture of RQ-170s and other clandestine drones. The shape of the RQ-170, which is publicly known and has even been distributed in official aircraft recognition guides , could also be used to represent any low-observable unmanned aircraft system in non-classified squadron materials. Another 732nd OG patch, showing emblems of the squadrons that belong to it, as well as the types of aircraft flown. Note that the fictional stealthy flying-wing drone symbol is used, but at the same time, the RQ-170 Silhouette is also used as well. , Aviationgear.com The Air Force has declined to say what types of aircraft the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron is flying at present. “I have no other information to provide in regards to your questions” was the final response from an Air Force spokesperson when we pressed them on the matter after what had otherwise been a very active and helpful dialogue. Who’s flying the RQ-170? Adding to the mysterious nature of the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron, and its relationship to both the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron and 732nd Operations Group Detachment 1, there is some official confusion about when any units assigned to the Operations Group began flying the RQ-170 at all. Despite the Air Force’s official statement that the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron does operate the stealthy drones, the Air Force Historical Research Agency initially said the 732nd Operations Group did not begin flying the type until 2015, three years after it gained control of the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron and the same year the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron came into being. A specially configured RQ-170 from the 30th RS detachment at Vandenberg AFB captured on approach in March of 2017. , Mathew Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com When we asked the Air Force Historical Research Agency about this discrepancy, they reached out to the 432nd Wing for clarification. We don’t know what those subsequent conversations entailed, but instead of correcting their own entries, the Air Force’s top historical arm stripped all mention of the RQ-170 from its on- and offline documentation about the 732nd Operations Group. This was done based on “advice from the [432nd’s] wing historian and Public Affairs [Office],” the Air Force Historian we had been working with on the matter told us afterward, before directing us to contact a higher headquarters for any additional information. The 732nd Operations Group might be home to one or more top-secret drone programs, or at least offer a public face to obscure that clandestine work, which wouldn’t necessarily be surprising . Available information already strongly suggests that the entire Group exists, at least in part, to help manage the Air Force’s semi-covert “gray” drone activities in close coordination with the secretive Joint Special Operations Command , the Central Intelligence Agency, and other elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community. The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron, with its RQ-170s, is perhaps the most obvious indicator of the 732nd’s more specialized mission sets. That squadron’s stealthy drones have flown covert missions over denied areas in Iran and likely North Korea , and helped monitor Osama Bin Laden’s compound ahead and during of the famous raid that led to his death. But other reports have also tied the 17th Attack Squadron, previously known as the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron, which flew MQ-1 Predators and now operates MQ-9 Reapers officially, to CIA-orchestrated drone strikes in Pakistan. 732nd OG Challenge coin showing the three types of aircraft flown including an RQ-170., Aviatorgear.com At present, the 732nd Operations Group still controls two additional Reaper units, the 22nd Attack Squadron and the 867th Attack Squadron. Both of these were previously known as reconnaissance squadrons before the Air Force made the decision to redesignate all MQ-9 units attack squadrons, owing to the fact that the drone can perform intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike missions. Still, there is very little public information about these two squadrons and their operations. Secret units for highly specialized missions All told, we can be reasonably sure we know the name of at least one secretive drone squadron and what’s become the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron has been associated with aircraft still operating in the clandestine realm. We don’t know for sure exactly what the outfit’s missions is or the exact type (or types) of secretive aircraft it flies, but we have some theories. The unit’s morale patch may offer some interesting clues as to what it is up to, or at least what it was up to while it was a detachment. The ‘forging the sword’ moniker and the RQ-170’s silhouette, in particular, are intriguing. It would seem that this detachment had something to do with developing new concepts of operations and capabilities sets for either the stealthy RQ-170 design or one similar to it—capabilities that were potentially kinetic in nature. We have long posited that a small semi-operational group of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) exist in the classified world in a similar fashion to how the F-117 was operated for the better part of a decade in total secrecy out of Tonopah Test Range Airport. It’s more likely than not that this aircraft is an evolutionary sibling of the RQ-170 Sentinel. There are a number of reasons for this conjecture which you can read all about here , but suffice it to say evolving the Sentinel from a penetrating reconnaissance platform to one capable of strike and possibly electronic warfare missions is glaringly logical. So much so that Lockheed’s Skunk Works planned on adapting the RQ-170 for the Navy’s now-defunct carrier-based UCAV program. That aircraft was called the Sea Ghost. And it’s very possible, if not probable, that the Sea Ghost was actually based on an existing land-based strike-capable iteration of the RQ-170 Sentinel. This notional aircraft is often referred to unofficially as the ‘Super Sentinel.’ Lockheed carrier-based UCAV concept dubbed Sea Ghost., Lockheed Martin The patch showing the lightning bolt (usually associated with electronic warfare) and the drops of blood (usually associated with kinetic attack) as if they were being released from below the RQ-170’s silhouette may also point to these new capabilities. ‘Forging the sword’ seems to also allude to the development of a new kinetic stealth drone capability and the unique concepts of operation needed to execute that mission. It’s also worth noting that although we seem to have decent insights into Boeing’s and Northrop Grumman’s individual sagas when it comes to trying to field an operational UCAV for the Pentagon, Lockheed’s involvement with these projects has been far more opaque. One thing we do know is that the company did succeed in producing the first known stealth drone that reached operational service. As such, it would be the top choice for pushing the penetrating tactical unmanned strike aircraft concept into an operational state. Once again, this is all better detailed in our past special feature on the Pentagon’s mysteriously missing UCAVs. Another possibility is that the unit has assumed operations of what is likely a very limited number of so-called RQ-180 high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) very stealthy reconnaissance drones. This aircraft, which the USAF has all but outright admitted to existing , is largely understood to be a Northrop Grumman product . The RQ-180 is thought to provide somewhat similar capabilities as the RQ-4 Global Hawk but it can survive on the edges or even well into contested airspace and persist there for long periods of time. It seems that this large drone has likely been flying for the better part of a decade, so making its transition over to an operational squadron in 2015, when the 732nd OG Detachment One ceased to exist and the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron was officially established, is quite plausible. Yet one thing to consider is that its mission would have much more in common with those flown by the RQ-4 strategic reconnaissance aircraft. This asset is headquartered out of Beale AFB in Northern California, not at Creech AFB. Additionally, the 732nd OG is focused on tactical reconnaissance, with aircraft like the MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-170, not strategic ones. We also come back to the 732nd OG Detachment 1’s patches, which clearly show a RQ-170 silhouette, not that of a stealthy HALE drone or something fictional to stand in for it. The great procurement debate If either of these platforms are indeed operational and flying with a USAF squadron in the classified domain, their existence is not being factored heavily into major Pentagon procurement decisions or  the critical debates that go along with them. This is a major issue as the USAF continues to buy throngs of short-ranged manned stealth fighters at great cost and to invest heavily in various reconnaissance platforms and entire intelligence-gathering ecosystems that aren’t nearly as survivable as what an aircraft like the RQ-180 could theoretically provide. The USAF’s willingness to cancel its E-8C JSTARS radar aircraft recapitalization plan for a vague ‘distributed model’ of radar-carrying aircraft, for instance, would be much better explained and supported if the existence of an RQ-180, or even a fleet of ‘Super Sentinels’ were disclosed. Those aircraft could potentially provide high-quality radar information and other intelligence and networking products while operating deep inside an enemy’s anti-access bubble—something that the Global Hawk or a bizjet configured E-8 replacement aircraft simply cannot do. Although a positive development in some ways, the potential existence of a small classified fleet of operational UCAVs is also troubling for a whole slew of reasons, as we have discussed in great detail before . This is not some exotic “bleeding edge” concept or technology; it was proven a decade and a half ago. Back then it represented the biggest leap in air combat capability since the jet engine, then it totally disappeared from the USAF purview—at least publicly. In fact, nowadays there is absolutely zero talk of UCAVs from the USAF. Instead, we get some manned-unmanned teaming concepts , which are not the same. UCAV’s leashed to manned aircraft may have their place, but such a concept drastically limits the UCAV’s potential. Clearly, the USAF and its industry partners have experimented deeply with networked and swarming UCAVs within the classified realm, but publicly, it’s as if the concept never even existed. What’s most troubling is that deeply classifying such a capability isn’t likely about hiding new combat aircraft technology from America’s enemies. As we stated many times before, the UCAV concept was proven nearly a decade and a half ago. The Navy has since publically landed stealthy UCAVs on an aircraft carrier and refueled them in mid-air. The reality is that the existence of a tiny group of operational UCAVs may not pose much of threat to America’s most capable enemies, but it does pose a huge threat to marquee manned fighter programs—one, in particular, that is worth more than a trillion dollars over its many decades-long life cycle. Manned fighters have certain advantages but for many missions the UCAV is highly attractive., USAF UCAVs can fly much farther than manned tactical jets without the reliance on vulnerable tankers, while still delivering an equal sized payload. And they can do all this without requiring or risking a pilot, and even potentially an armada of combat search and rescue aircraft and personnel, in the process. They can also be designed to be far harder to detect (more stealthy) and cost much less to produce and much less to sustain. UCAVs could also be procured faster and adapted to new missions quicker with much lower risk than their manned counterparts. And these are just a few of the many benefits of UCAVs . So at least for some missions, they make much more sense than manned fighter aircraft. But that doesn’t mean it has to be an entirely ‘either-or’ proposition—a mixed fleet of manned fighters and UCAVs is best at this time—but it would be hard for the USAF to justify buying over 1,700 F-35s when UCAVs are also readily available. Meanwhile, America’s prime technological peer-state adversary, China, is progressing quickly when it comes to UCAV capabilities, and that’s just based on what Beijing wants to show us. America’s own allies are also forging ahead with UCAV experimentation via aircraft like nEURon and Taranis. With all this in mind, the USAF would be hard-pressed to justify keeping a pocket UCAV force secret, considering how doing so loads the deck when it comes to critical decisions about the future makeup of the Air Force’s order of battle. And those decisions made today will have an impact over many decades to come. Now it’s also possible that the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron flies the standard RQ-170 or maybe a less ambitious derivative of the aircraft. But then why keep it so secret when the type has been known to exist for a decade, and the USAF has already admitted to the unit’s sister squadron operating a fleet of them? Then again the unit could be flying something else altogether, but the evidence surely points away from that direction. In the end, the existence of the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron could be our best indication yet that a major new drone program has moved into an operational state in recent years. At the very least it’s another sign that the USAF seems to want to hide its high-end unmanned capabilities as long as it possibly can. Regardless of the finer details, the 44th RS is quietly flying something that the Air Force isn’t willing to talk about.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 10, 2018",American General Says ‘Adversaries’ Are Jamming AC-130 Gunships in Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The head of the U.S. Special Operations Command says unspecified opponents in Syria, almost certainly Russian or Russian-support forces, have reportedly launched electronic warfare attacks against U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunships operating in the country, as well as other communications links. This is the latest in a string of reports that highlight the growing threat of jamming and other non-kinetic attacks to American military activities in the region and in general . U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas revealed the new details in a keynote speech at the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation’s 2018 GEOINT Symposium . The officer, who is in charge of all of America’s special operations activities, used the anecdote to describe some of the challenges his operator face in sending and receiving intelligence and other critical information across the battlefield. “Right now in Syria, we’re in the most aggressive EW [electronic warfare] environment on the planet from our adversaries,” Thomas said. “They’re testing us every day, knocking our communications down, disabling our AC-130s, etcetera.” Other reports have suggested the general actually referred to the U.S. Air Force’s EC-130H Compass Call electronic warfare aircraft, but this does not appear to be the case when listening to recordings of the talk. In addition, Thomas says “our” aircraft and the EC-130s are not part of the Air Force’s Special Operations Command, which is assigned to SOCOM. Of course, he could also just be using “our” to describe American forces in Syria in general. You can watch General Thomas’ full speech below. He makes his comments about Syria at around 9:20 in the runtime. For AC-130 crews, an enemy jamming their communications systems or data links could be especially perilous for both American special operators and supporting conventional forces and innocent bystanders. The gunships rely heavily on those systems to help locate and positively identify targets and then coordinate their attacks with other manned and unmanned aircraft and joint tactical air controllers on the ground. Without those added tools, it can be extremely difficult for the crew to differentiate between friendly and hostile forces, and civilians, in the heat of a firefight. This is especially so at night, when AC-130s almost exclusively operate, and when American personnel are calling for support in so-called “ danger close ” situations where they might be situated very near to the intended target. This could force a gunship to abort a potentially critical attack run or otherwise delay desperately needed fire support. If the crew were to press ahead with the mission, they could be doing so with increased risks. We have seen various examples of how badly this could play out in the past few years. An AC-130U Spooky gunship links up with an aerial refueling tanker during a training exercise. , USAF During a now infamous terrorist ambush of American and Nigerien troops in Niger in October 2017, French Mirage multi-role combat aircraft that arrived overhead did not attack the enemy fighters for fear of hitting friendly forces who were “ overlapping ” with the militants. The degraded capability, or outright inability, of U.S. personnel to communicate with the pilots was reportedly a factor . In October 2015, an AC-130U Spooky gunship inadvertently destroyed a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan that the humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières, also known as doctors without borders, was operating at the time. A subsequent investigation showed that a key data link on the aircraft was not working at the time and that U.S. special operators on the ground blocks away from the intended target had decided to try and “talk in” the strike using only verbal descriptions of a building they could not physically see. A friendly fire incident in Afghanistan in 2014 , in which a B-1 bomber accidentally killed five Americans, offers yet another example of how things can go wrong. A final review of that incident found that the inability of the aircraft’s targeting system to detect infrared strobes that special operators use to identify themselves to friendly aircraft and miscommunication were both contributing factors. Jamming GPS receivers could also more directly impair a gunships ability to accurately attack targets. The AC-130W Stinger II , one of the types we know has been flying over Syria and Iraq, relies heavily on precision-guided munitions, including GPS-guided types such as the GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). Many of the same factors could apply to any EC-130H or even regular C-130 operations in Syria. In addition to being able to jam targets themselves, the Compass Calls can locate enemy emitters and quickly relay that information on to other units who can then take additional action to either gather information or strike those targets. And while the United States has set up a number of forward operating bases , complete with airstrips in many cases, to help resupply forces in Syria, the jamming could impede airlift missions or airdrops of supplies, the latter of which could be vital in an emergency. Not only do C-130s use GPS-enabled navigation systems to guide them to their drop zones, the U.S. Air Force also now employs GPS-assisted airdrop systems to better guide those deliveries closer to their intended recipients. This reduces the chances the packages will end up in a difficult or impossible to reach location, get damaged after impacting especially rugged terrain, or fall into enemy hands. Depending on the how widespread and effective the electronic attacks are, they might have an impact on other types of U.S. manned and unmanned aircraft operating over Syria, too. A wide array of fixed-wing combat and combat support aircraft, as well as helicopters ,  are presently supporting the American-led fight against ISIS in the eastern part of the country. A US Air Force C-130J-30 offloads cargo at an undisclosed location in Syria., USAF And though General Thomas did not name any adversaries specifically, Russia has and continues to demonstrate its expanding electronic warfare capabilities , especially in Europe , and has publicly stated that it has deployed them in Syria . Syrian government forces or militias aligned with the country’s dictator Bashar Al Assad could have some capabilities of their own, as well, but would have almost certainly sourced them from the Kremlin. Russian mercenaries could even be the ones operating the Syrian equipment, allowing officials Moscow to distance themselves from attacks on American troops. We at The War Zone have already noted previous U.S. military reports about GPS jamming in Syria and other information about installing jam-resistant equipment on secretive spy planes supporting special operations forces in the region. It’s also worth noting that the full extent of Russian electronic warfare capabilities in Syria, or those of any other actor, remains unclear. Previous reports have suggested that unmanned aircraft, such as the MQ-9 Reaper, have not suffered as a result of at least some of the jamming, suggesting the attacks could be highly localized or otherwise not powerful enough to disable microwave satellite communications data links. Thomas’ remarks, however, would seem to suggest the situation is far more dangerous than we previously understood. One of Russia’s truck-mounted 1RL257E Krasukha-4 electronic warfare systems, which could be among the assets it has deploy in Syria., Vitaly Kuzmin Regardless, the Kremlin has every reason to do as much as it can, as I have written before with regards to the apparent jamming of American drones: “And it’s hard to imagine that Russia would not take advantage of this capability in its larger effort to impede American activities in Eastern Syria, which is staunchly opposes. Jamming the short-range drones limits the ability American troops to gain a better understanding of the situation around them, which can in turn only hamper their mission planning process and increase risks for them during more extended operations. “Jamming would also be a way to help keep U.S. unmanned aircraft out of Western Syria, where Assad’s regime is more firmly in control and where his forces continue to commit crimes against humanity with impunity. Still, manned aircraft from the American-led coalition fighting ISIS long ago stopped flying in that part of the country and the dubious de-confliction line Russia and the United States have agreed to in order to separate their operations should preclude any drones from missions there, as well. … “Jamming the linkages between a drone and its controllers on the ground is also a relatively low-risk proposition for Russia. If it succeeds in destroying the aircraft it is unlikely that an American service member will die in the process, reducing the likelihood of any immediate escalation. The largely opaque relationship actual Russian troops in the country have with private military contractors, militias aligned with Assad, Iranian personnel , and Syrian government forces give the Kremlin significant avenues to deny any responsibility whatsoever.” The same logic applies to more widespread electronic warfare attacks against other aircraft and communications nodes on the ground. It makes even more sense after the U.S.-led missile strikes on Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure on April 14, 2018. Though, as we noted, there have been reports that this has been going on for years now, the Kremlin is only likely to step up these activities as a low-cost, but still direct retaliatory response to the missile barrage. It is a much more deniable and discreet way of harassing the United States than other threats the Russians have made, such as reported plans to supply the Syrian regime with long-range S-300 surface-to-air missiles . Russia’s R-330Zh Zhitel, which is focused on jamming cellular satellite communications, another system it may have in Syria., Vitaly Kuzmin More to the point, the electronic warfare attacks, which can hamper operations or reduce confidence in certain communications and navigation systems, are well in line with Russia’s new hybrid warfare concepts , which also involve the use of proxy forces and information operations to muddy the waters surrounding various conflicts and obscure its involvement. General Thomas’ speech is only the most recent indication that there is truly a low-grade fight occurring between Russian and U.S. forces in Syria, as well as their respective partners, despite official narratives to the contrary. There is every indication that the Kremlin will continue to conduct these types of activities for the foreseeable future as is seeks to push American forces out of Syria for good.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 5, 2018",F-16 From Luke AFB Has Crashed Near Lake Havasu (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details are limited at this time, but it appears that an F-16 based out of Luke AFB has crashed near Lake Havasu, possibly while attempting to make an emergency landing at a small airport. A photo of a largely intact—sans cockpit—F-16 with Luke AFB markings laying on the ground has popped up on the Air Force amn/nco/snco Facebook page. According to initial reports, which we cannot confirm at this time, the pilot was able to make it out and was walking around after the crash. We have reached out to Luke AFB directly and they have confirmed that one of their aircraft was involved in a mishap and that more details will be coming soon. Luke AFB, located on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona is a major training base for F-16 pilots from around the world as well as F-35 pilots. A spate of major mishaps has plagued the Pentagon’s air arms as of late. One of which was a deadly mishap involving an F-16 belonging to the USAF Thunderbirds, as well as two mishaps involving F-22s from the same home base . A USMC CH-53E also crashed killing four crew onboard and an Army Apache was lost killing both crewmen. A Harrier was also lost while on exercise in Africa. Weeks before that a Navy F/A-18F crashed in Key West killing both officers onboard and a USAF HH-60G Pave Hawk went down in Iraqi killing everyone inside the helicopter. It is becoming increasingly clear that the DoD is facing a readiness crisis across its flying forces. Update: 12:12pm PST— According to Lake Havasu Firefighters official Facebook account, the pilot ejected after the F-16 rolled off the runway during an emergency landing. An official release from Luke AFB reads: “An F-16C assigned to the 56th Fighter Wing diverted and attempted to land at Lake Havasu City Municipal Airport, Lake Havasu City, Ariz. at approximately 10:35 a.m. today during a routine training flight. During landing the aircraft departed the prepared surface and the pilot ejected from the aircraft. The pilot is in good condition and is being transported to Havasu Regional Medical Center. First responders are on site and there is no immediate danger to the public.” Official Release Havasu City Municipal has an 8,000X100 foot runway, which is long enough for an F-16 to land safely under normal conditions. If the jet had lost the ability to brake and/or landed long during a flameout, that’s a different story as there is no arresting wire or barrier available to stop it from rolling beyond the runway’s far edge. Google Earth Update: 2:42pm PST— Below is a link to some amazing audio from the first responders’ point of view as the incident occurred. It states that a flight of two F-16s were present when one had a flameout and attempted an emergency landing, which ended in the aircraft rolling off the north end of the runway. The pilot ejected prior to the jet departing the runway surface. He landed via parachute on the runway and was walking around as the first responders showed up. No fire was reported at the scene. Here is a direct link to the audio if for some reason the Facebook link doesn’t work. Update: 4:05pm PST— Here is the latest statement from Luke AFB: “Pilot released, flying operations resume LUKE AIR FORCE BASE, Ariz. – The pilot involved in the incident Tuesday morning was released from Havasu Regional Medical Center this afternoon. Personnel from Luke Air Force Base are en route to the scene to begin recovery of the aircraft. An interim safety investigation board has been established for the incident and will conduct a full investigation. Flying operations at Luke Air Force Base resumed this afternoon after pausing for several hours. This is the final update. Additional questions should be directed to Public Affairs.” Update: 6:10pm PST— Here are some new photos: Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aerial refueling videos never get old. Sometimes they are beautiful , sometimes they are absolutely terrifying , sometimes they are surprising , sometimes they are informative , and sometimes they offer a little insight into the daily banter that occurs between flying gas stations and their customers. In this case, a KC-10 Extender boom operator shoots the breeze with an F-15E Strike Eagle crew while gassing up over the Persian Gulf, and coffee and its many forms are the topic of choice. One of the things the big jet and cargo plane flyers have on the fighter guys is the ability to get up and walk around, make good snacks, and even take along a Keurig for the ride. This comes up often, including in this video. Also of particular note is that this sortie is the Strike Eagle pilot’s final one in the F-15E. Soon he will be flying the same aircraft he is sipping gas from—the KC-10. He even gives thanks for the gas with a nice break and flare release as he drops off the boom. A similar video was posted recently in which an F-22 pilot talks to a KC-10 boom operator about shooting stars, thinking about space, and their common love for Chick-Fil-A. It’s a classic. What most don’t realize is that the tanker’s boom and the receiving aircraft’s receptacle have intercom connections that activate once the aircraft are in contact. This way the boom operator and the pilot can converse clearly and securely without using the radios which can be negatively impacted by environmental and operational factors, and just poor operational security. The repartee between ‘boom’ and pilot makes the whole aerial dance look incredibly easy, which it absolutely is not.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Marines Corps Eyes Man-Portable Suicide Drones To Blast Targets on Land and At Sea,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After eliminating 120mm mortars from its infantry units, the U.S. Marine Corps said it would look to refocus its attention on giving those same elements a new “precision fires” weapon , but gave few details as to what such a system might look like. A new contracting announcement indicates that the service is now considering buying man-portable suicide drones as at least one possible replacement. On April 23, 2018, the U.S. Marine Corps Rapid Capabilities Office, or MCRCO, a division of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, issued a notice on the U.S. government’s main contracting website FedBizOpps, asking vendors to submit information about possible options for a tube-launched loitering munition. At present, the service has no formal plans to purchase these weapons as part of what it is calling the Organic Precision Fires (OPF) program and says it is merely conducting “market research.” The OPF project’s goals are to “enhance the range, precision and/or lethality of Marine Corps munitions against stationary and/or mobile land and/or sea targets in all operating environments,” according to the announcement. At present, extended range fire support in Marine infantry units comes primarily from 81mm mortars and FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles, with separate artillery units having longer range, ground-based stand-off weapons such as the M777 155mm towed howitzer and truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS . In March 2018, the Marines retired their 120mm M327 mortars , a system that had long failed to meet expectations. Able to fire rounds out to a maximum range of five miles, that weapon had still filled an important gap between the smaller infantry weapons and the larger artillery systems. Marines fire an M327 120mm mortar., USMC MCRCO’s base requirements for the new OPF weapon would give those units considerably greater range than they had even with the troublesome M327. At a minimum, the new loitering munition should be able to maintain a connection with a portable ground control station at a distance of more than 15.5 miles, but the objective is to find a system that can reach targets at more than twice that distance. It should be able to fly for at least an hour and carry an unspecified sensor suite to perform local intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission, as well as allow for recognition and positive identification of targets. An individual should be able to strike at a particular set of GPS coordinates or aim the unmanned aircraft manually using the ground control interface. If the unmanned aircraft does not end up striking something at the end of its flight, the Corps wants to be able to recover it for future use. It should have some type of built-in system to get it back if it gets lost or the data link gets cut, too. One option would be for the drone to have a pre-set “home” waypoint that it would return to if something happened. The launch tube needs to be less than a foot in diameter and shorter than eight feet long and it shouldn’t take more than two Marines to carry the complete weapon system and put it into action. Ideally, a single individual should be able to do so. The kind of loitering munitions the MCRCO is describing are hardly new. The various U.S. military services, especially special operations forces, already employ AeroVironment’s Switchblade man-portable system, also known as the Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile Systems (LMAMS), or have experimented with it in tests and exercises. Switchblade has both electro-optical and infrared cameras and a single individual can fire it quickly from a man-portable launcher. AeroVironment is also now offering a Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL) that can hold six of the suicide drones at once. The only problem is that Switchblade has neither the range nor the endurance the Marines are looking for, only able to fly for a mere 10 minutes and to a maximum range of just over 6 miles from the ground control station. AeroVironment has pitched the idea of using its hand-launched RQ-20 Puma drone, which the Marines already employ, as a spotter for the smaller loitering munitions. Unfortunately, the extra target detection range this pairing might offer does nothing to improve Switchblade’s own range and flight duration limitations, meaning Marines might still have to either move closer to the target or wait for it to get within range before being able to attack. Either option could put them at greater risk and effectively negate the system’s utility as an organic, extended range fire support weapon. Another option might be a weaponized, man-portable version of Raytheon’s Coyote drone , which meets the range and endurance parameters in its present, sensor-carrying form. The U.S. Navy has already tested this unmanned aircraft as part of its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology effort, or LOCUST , and helped the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) turn them into disposable hurricane hunters . The U.S. Army has also expressed an interest in using them to intercept other small, hostile drones. Raytheon’s Coyote., Joseph Trevithick A system such as Coyote, able to readily accommodate various different payloads, could help in overcoming any challenges with a line-of-sight data link over extended ranges. One or more of the drones could act as relays between the loitering muntions and their ground control stations. There are also purpose-built, man-portable loitering munitions on the market that would meet the Marine Corps’ requirements. Israeli firm Uvision’s tube-launched Hero series , in particular, seems well suited to the service’s needs. In addition to having the necessary performance, depending on the variant, they feature the ability for the operator to easily abort the strike to avoid potential collateral damage or directly allow for man-in-the-loop control for greater accuracy during the terminal stage of flight and the ability to hit moving targets. But while the Corps has a number of options immediately available to choose from, it might find it more difficult to identify a system that is practical for wide-spread employment on a routine basis by infantry units. Cost will almost certainly be a major factor in how the service decides to proceed with the project. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7ww1ZLN4ClI Both the Marines and the Army have already found that the Javelin can offer useful precision fire support for small units. The problem is that each one of those missiles costs $80,000 , which has made it hard to justify employing them against relatively limited targets sets, such as heavy machine gun and mortar emplacements and small groups of enemy personnel in the open or behind cover. Switchblade, which as we already noted does not alone meet the Marine Corps’ requirements, has a similar unit cost of more than $70,000. A Coyote only costs around $15,000, but this is for a system without the targeting and other capabilities required to turn it into a loitering munition. It is unclear what the exact price point for the various Hero loitering munitions are, but it seems likely that it would closer to Switchblade than Coyote. Still, as a direct replacement for the M327 mortar and its associated components, a complete system that cost more than $1 million, these munitions could offer a lower cost option with significantly greater capability. The ability to recover and reuse drones after simple surveillance missions would also help reduce the overall costs of employment, giving Marine units a multi-purpose tool that would enhance their overall understanding of the battlefield, identify potential threats, and strike if possible or necessary. A man-portable loitering munition would not be able to provide anything approaching the volume of fire of a mortar, though. A multi-round canister, such as AeroVironment’s MPL could allow for rapid follow-up strikes, but it is still a far more limited system compared to existing, more traditional indirect fire weapons. Commandant of the Marine Corps General Robert Neller examines an 81mm Advanced Capability Extended Range Mortar ( ACERM ) precision-guided mortar round, which could offer an additional means of improving the fire support capabilities of small Marine units in addition to loitering munitions., USN With a simple to use, man-portable system, units could also decide to only issue the systems when they would be most useful, such as during distributed, expeditionary operations. In the Pacific region where the “tyranny of distance” is especially visible, in any future conflict, small groups of Marines could easily find themselves in remote or austere locations without the benefit of immediate, on-call ground-based fire support or air cover. In addition, to provide much needed organic surveillance and precision fire support capabilities, a small group of loitering munitions might be able to throw off enemy forces by attacking from multiple directions at once. This is not something that would necessarily be possible with a typical mortar or other indirect fire weapons, even when using precision guided ammunition . There’s also nothing to say the Marine Corps can’t or won’t pursue a number of different systems to offer a more layered fire support capability for various levels of infantry units. This could help address cost issues by acquiring less capable , but also less expensive systems that small groups of Marines would find more readily usable for day-to-day activities. Those units could reserve more advanced loitering munitions for higher priority operations. All told, it seems very likely that the Marines could add loitering munitions to their arsenal, but it remains to be seen how many units will actually get them and how the Corps decides to employ them operationally.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 16, 2016",Video Shows Blue Angels F/A-18 Hornet Spewing Fire After Bird Strike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Maintenance crews from the Blue Angels are still assessing the damage to one of the U.S. Navy aerial demonstration team’s F/A-18 Hornets after a bird got sucked through one of its engines during a recent show. With the unit’s lead solo #5 jet flying low, a spectator at the Vero Beach Air Show was able to capture the dramatic moment at which the mishap occurred, which resulted in flames streaking out behind the aircraft. The incident occurred on April 21, 2018 at the Vero Beach Air Show in Florida. Catherine Caddell, the show’s director of marketing, initially told local reports that the accident had caused an estimated $1 million in damage , which would make it a Class B mishap according to the U.S. military’s official definitions . U.S. Navy Lieutenant David Gardner, a spokesman for the Blue Angels, later said that the accident was under investigation, that there was no official cost estimate, and that it was unclear when the jet would be flyable again. The pilot was able to make an emergency landing and did not suffer any injuries. “Bird strikes are fairly common,” Gardner added in a statement to the Pensacola News Journal after the accident. “Our pilots, and all naval aviators, are trained to deal with any number of contingencies that could occur during flight, including bird strikes.” According to a recent investigation by Military Times , between 2011 and 2017, “wildlife strikes” accounted for approximately 8 percent of all Class A, B, and C mishaps. The nearly 520 incidents resulted in around $182 million worth of damage in total. The accident comes as the U.S. military as a whole is seeing a worrisome spike in aviation mishaps, including a spate of incidents earlier in April 2018 that killed seven aviators in the space of just 96 hours. In 2016, the Blue Angels themselves suffered a deadly crash during a practice session that claimed the life of Captain Jeff Kuss who was flying the #6 jet at the time. This latest incident could easily have been much worse. Slow, high-alpha type maneuvers, such as those practiced by the Blue Angels solos, can leave pilots particularly vulnerable to a catastrophic loss of power. At low altitudes and at the bottom edge of the aircraft’s performance envelope, there is little opportunity to try and recover from such an incident. In 2014, a Canadian pilot, Brian Bews, in a CF-18A+ Hornet experienced just such a situation during a practice run for an air show at the county airport in Lethbridge, Alberta. With no power in one engine and flying less than 300 feet off the ground, Bews ejected to safety as his fighter jet rolled over and slammed into the ground in a ball of flames, as seen in the video below. Thankfully, the bird ingestion happened while Blue Angel #5 wasn’t in such a vulnerable state. It’s a relatively welcome report in what has already been a terrible year for U.S. military aviation. At the time of writing yet another crash has occurred just today , this time involving an F-16 from Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 27, 2018",North Korea Shows Zero Signs It Is Willing To Consider Denuclearization,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. North Korea’s young and brutal dictator Kim Jong Un has gone from one of the world’s top pariahs to a man in demand who is stepping out onto the world stage and getting rockstar-like attention in doing so. The signs of this ascension were evident when Kim’s sister visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics. The press fawned over her like an exotic and wondrous creature from a mythical land. Then, following his unprecedented meeting with high-ranking South Korean officials, through which he sent a message to President Trump that he wanted to meet, the stage was set for the rise of Kim—even if it only turns out to be a temporary phenomenon. Since then Kim Jong Un has been meeting with other international leaders and even left his ‘hermit kingdom’ for the first time in nearly seven years—since becoming premier—for a meeting with Xi Jinping, President of China, North Korea’s closest ally. Kim is now set to receive Jinping in Pyongyang in the near future , a historic visit that will only elevate the ‘young general’s’ profile as viewed through a global lens. Kim Jong Un and his wife on a surprise trip to the Chinese capital. , AP Many claim all this is a horrendous abomination, that no leader of a country with a human rights record like North Korea should be accepted by the world community, let alone meet directly with the leader of the free world. In a perfect world that may be so, but ours is far from it. Injecting Kim into the world community—showing him what is possible if he has the courage to truly change the behavior of his military state—will be absolutely key in realizing any tangible change. The fact of the matter is that Kim Jong Un is the ruler of North Korea. He has consolidated power with an iron machine gun trigger finger, and at this point, the chances of him being overthrown by parties that are more moderate are next to nil. So you deal with him or you accept the status quo and try to contain him, or even worse, you spill a river of blood and smelt endless treasure by removing him from power militarily. Kim’s new tone came to a point this week after it was learned that CIA Chief and Trump’s next Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to Pyongyang to meet with Kim and his aides. Not too long after that news broke, North Korea state media released a statement saying that the country would not test any more missiles and would be shutting down its underground Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Kim Jong Un’s sister, Jim Yo Jong, sits with South Korean President Moon Jae In during the Winter Olympics, a moment that was was considered nearly unthinkable just weeks before. , AP The mainstream media ran this story as if it was nearly a statement of surrender of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, but in reality, it was quite the opposite. Although the statement may be a good indication of a more stable situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region as a whole after a year of drastically-escalating tension, it is by no means a sign that Pyongyang will be turning over their nuclear weapons and dismantling its ballistic missiles anytime soon. The statement, which is free of the usual anti-American bluster, reads: KCNA statement If anything this clearly says that the regime sees that it has accomplished its nuclear deterrent aims and will retain its arsenal and delivery systems while abstaining from further live testing. In addition, this does not mean it will end development of its delivery systems or its nuclear warheads. North Korea’s nuclear test site is known to be in a very unstable condition and detonations there have likely caused geological issues in the region which it is located. By some accounts, the site is totally unusable after the test of a far more powerful nuclear device than the ones tested prior, which by most accounts was a thermonuclear weapon. As such, North Korea is giving nothing up here. It is simply reframing the abandonment of the test site as some sort of a give prior to the Kim-Trump summit. Additionally, North Korea is likely to the point where computer modeling can provide the information they need to improve their warhead designs’ reliability and increase their yields. Like North Korea, Pakistan and India each tested six devices before they could rely fully on computer modelling for further development. As for its missile programs, nothing in the statement even brushes on the possibility that they will destroy existing delivery systems or stop the development of existing or even new ones, they simply aren’t going to test them for the time being. Considering the increasingly perilous state of the North Korean economy, one in which exports and imports have been drastically curtailed, there probably isn’t the funds available to execute a series of new test launches even if they wanted to. The statement even tries to assuage fears that they could sell their nuclear technology to anyone with cold hard cash. This certainly wouldn’t be an issue for a country that is planning on denuclearizing, would it? So what North Korea seems to be proposing here is a nuclear and missile test freeze, but beyond that, it can still keep and develop its nuclear arsenal while it joins the world community in hoping for a day in which nuclear weapons are no longer needed. Sounds beautiful, doesn’t it? But just because North Korea isn’t unilaterally disposing of its nukes and missiles doesn’t mean this statement isn’t a good step in the right direction. If this is what Pyongyang is proposing, it may be possible to get a hard nuclear and missile freeze put into place—one based on third-party verification and strict controls. As we have said for years now, this would be a big win, especially considering they still have yet to fully prove their ability to deliver a miniaturized nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile over long distances. What looks like a very fun meeting between Kim and Chinese diplomats., AP Some will say North Korea has made agreements and broken them before. That’s true, but the immediate threat of snap-back sanctions and a preemptive strike is a powerful tool now on the table. Additionally, Kim Jong Un is not his father or his grandfather. He has been remarkably open about his intentions and capabilities, and if he gets a taste of even granular respect on the world stage, it could lead to real reforms. Also keep in mind the drastically different relationship the North has with the South now after just a couple months of talks. For Kim to backtrack on all this just to test nuclear bombs and launch rockets, while also sending his economy back into a death spiral, seems totally illogical. The timing of the announcement leading up to the summit between Kim and Trump is also a big tell. It has been repeatedly reported that North Korea is indeed willing to talk about denuclearization during the historic meeting. Once again, too many this sounds like an indication of capitulation, but really it isn’t at all. North Korea has said they support a denuclearized Korean Peninsula even during the height of the standoff with the United States. And of course, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula means totally different things to different parties. If you’re North Korea it means the U.S. pulling back its nuclear umbrella from the region as well as removing its own physical warheads from the landmass. If you’re National Security Advisor John Bolton it means North Korea telling the U.S. what ports and airports it can load-up and totally remove the country’s nuclear arsenal and program materials within a week. Watch for yourself starting at about the 3:00 minute mark: Even Mike Pompeo, who was just in Pyongyang meeting with Kim, stated the following at the 2017 Aspen Security Forum : It would be a great thing to denuclearize the peninsula to get those weapons off that but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today. So from the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two, right, separate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart. Trump himself has taken North Korea’s latest statement as a plan to denuclearize, which as we clearly point out, is far from it, posting the following tweet yesterday: I have applauded the President’s willingness to seize the opportunity and talk directly with Kim Jong Un as he had promised before making it to the Oval Office—something I have stated was absolutely necessary for years now. But if outright capitulation to Washington’s demands is the only acceptable outcome to these talks they could result in an even more perilous situation than we were in before the recent detente began. And it’s not as if a path to achieving that grand goal couldn’t be part of a larger more dynamic strategy, but that would mean near instant denuclearization would have to be put aside for more plausible but still major shorter-term diplomatic gains. For instance, a deal could include the lifting of some sanctions for a testing and production freeze of both Kim’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs that would have to be continuously verified by international inspectors. If North Korea violates the terms of the agreement the sanctions snap back in place with full force along will the military pressure campaign—or worse. Under such a deal, after a certain period of time, say 24 months, the North Koreans will be presented with a highly attractive aid and diplomatic package that will open North Korea up more to the outside world and make the country far more stable economically if it is willing to give up its nuclear arsenal and meet basic humanitarian requirements. This would be a grand package that could be tied with a major de-escalation of the standoff between North and South and even a non-aggression deal with the United States. The idea here is that after 24 months of being lauded on the world stage and realizing the potential his country has in terms of trade, as well as the possibility of finally dissipating the cloud of paranoia the regime has been under for decades as it has feared a decapitation strike or an apocalyptic war, Kim would be far more likely to consider taking such a deal. The fact that many parties would be willing to help North Korea become a more successful and peaceful state directly would also be a huge selling point. Mike Pompeo, now Trump’s top diplomat., AP This is just one example of how denuclearization could occur, but it won’t happen overnight. And for those who say it will never work because the bitter hatred and perpetual state of war will never end, there are plenty of examples around the globe that say otherwise. So the fact that Kim’s star is rising on the world stage, and he seems to really like this fact, is a good development that can be readily exploited. In essence, his increasing connection with the greater world community is the most probable catalyst that could bring about a major change on the Korean Peninsula. This critical observation needs to be carefully factored into the aims of Trump-Kim summit. By providing him a series of stepping stones where his ego won’t be obliterated in the process of stepping away from his nuclear stockpile, it may actually happen. He can first claim a strategic win for his people, saying his goals of achieving a nuclear deterrent are achieved, and then once trust is built with external parties, he can be offered an incredibly lucrative opportunity to usher his people into a new age. AP If what equates to a demand made under threat to immediately surrender the regime’s most prized insurance policy—something that would be an unthinkably embarrassing and costly loss for Kim Jong Un—is the only acceptable outcome for the White House, the summit is more likely to be a squandered opportunity that will end in disaster than any type of success. And the world community, including China and even South Korea, that are already taking a higher view of Kim as a leader, could turn away from the U.S. for walking away from a far more realistic deal that still could be considered a monumental leap in the right direction—one that could at the very least avoid a massive war the likes of which the world hasn’t seen for a very long time.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",It’s No Surprise India Finally Ditched Its Stealth Fighter Program With Russia,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. India has reportedly stopped working with Russia on the long-troubled Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft program, or FGFA, a shared effort that was supposed to produce an improved variant of the equally vexing Su-57 stealth fighter . Though hardly surprising, with years of reports that the Indian government has become increasingly disappointed in the project’s progress and the aircraft’s capabilities, the decision could have significant ramifications for both countries. On April 20, 2018, Jane’s 360 reported that the Indian Air Force had put FGFA program on indefinite hold, citing unnamed official sources. India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defense Secretary Sanjay Mitra had reportedly told visiting Russian officials of the decision in February 2018. Similar reports also appeared in domestic Indian outlets . Officials from India and Russia have not offered any official statement to confirm the program has come to an end and Indian officials have reportedly indicated that they might be willing to revisit the project in the future. This bureaucratic maneuvering may allow both sides to avoid having to acknowledge that the effort has collapsed, which is messaging Russia would be especially sensitive to. Regardless, it appears the FGFA project is effectively dead following more than a decade of negotiations, delays, and struggles with the Su-57. Also known as the T-50 or the PAK FA, that stealth fighter was supposed to serve as the basis for the Indian jet. The video below shows on the Russian Air Force’s pre-production Su-57s preparing to take part in Russia’s annual Victory Day parade in May 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=FMzFtcTLFSQ In principle, this made good sense, as India would be able to save time and money by starting with an established design. Fifth generation fighter jet programs have proven to be extremely complex, costly, and time-consuming affairs, and sharing the burden was supposed to offer a win-win situation for both parties. The two countries expected the multi-billion dollar partnership between India’s state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Russia’s Sukhoi would lead to a production order of more than 100 FGFAs, with much of the actual manufacturing occurring in India. According to the report from India’s Business Standard , the Su-57’s actual low-observable characteristics were among the biggest issues. The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway has long called these features into question himself, writing : “A jet’s fan face produces a massive radar signature. Modern high-performance stealthy aircraft designs use ‘S’ shaped ducts to hide their engines from most or all line of sight aspects, with radar return scrambling baffles being built under the duct surface scrambling returns even more. Some aircraft, like the Super Hornet, use a slotted baffle that covers the fan faces of their engine, which are hidden only partially by the aircraft’s duct shape. This measure reduces the aircraft’s frontal radar signature, but it is less effective than an s shaped duct and may impact certain aspects of engine performance. Many other features on the T-50 also put a high level of low observability in doubt.” It has seemed increasingly clear that the underlying Su-57 design might simply not be readily adaptable to being stealthier than it is in its present form. India may also feel that it has less flexibility to accept a design that doesn’t meet more stringent low-observability requirements, even if it has other features that could offset those deficiencies in the near term, on the promise of receiving a stealthier variant in the future. As both the Su-57 and the FGFA have turned into a shared saga, China, one of India’s most likely regional opponents, has surged ahead in developing fifth generation aircraft. The Chinese say that the J-20 stealth fighter is now operational and they are in the process of developing a medium-weight stealth combat jet , as well as a host of stealthy unmanned aircraft , all of which might eventually work together in the future as a manned-unmanned team. A notorious shot of a T-50 prototype showing how the turbofan’s “fan face” is largely exposed., Public Domain In addition, Pakistan is reportedly eying cooperating with China on its own fifth generation fighter jet . The two countries already successfully partnered to develop the much simpler JF-17 lightweight fighter . Stealth was hardly the Su-57’s only issue, though. There have long been concerns about whether the Saturn AL-41F turbofans, or even an advanced derivative thereof, would be sufficient enough to power the Su-57. On top of that, there are just questions about the reliability and quality control of Saturn’s production in general . The AL-41 series are derived from the AL-31F, which powers India’s Su-30MKI Flankers. Those turbofans have a very short average time between overhaul (TBO) of around 1,000 hours, at which time they need to go back to a depot, possibly in Russia. The new engines have greatly increased TBO according to their manufacturer, but how accurate such a claim is unknown. The Russians did conduct the first flight test of a pre-production Su-57 with the more powerful Saturn Izdeliye 30, another AL-31F derivative, in December 2017. Unfortunately, that engine isn’t slated to enter serial production until at least 2020 and, by the Kremlin’s own estimation , is unlikely to be ready to go into a production variant of the stealth fighter until 2025. The Su-57’s present design also lacks a “modular engine concept” that could make routine maintenance more time consuming and costly. It also might prevent the Indians from doing more maintenance locally, which could easily have been a non-starter for the country, which makes domestic production and sustainment support a major priority in all of its defense deals. Lastly, there have reportedly been major disputes regarding the sharing of technical data relating to the jet’s flight computer and mission software. The Kremlin has apparently repeatedly refused to give its counterparts in New Dehli full access to the code , which would have given the Russians much more control over any final product. One of the pre-production Su-57s., Aktug Ates via Wikimedia As combat aircraft become increasingly software-driven in general, both to run their basic flight systems and to manage sensors, targeting, and other data management and transfer functions, this will only become more of an issue for any countries collaborating on advanced designs. Various international partners in the U.S. military’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program have begun to increasingly voice concerns that the interconnected nature of that plane’s computer brain could pose a national security risk . But while India might see good cause to finally cancel the underperforming FGFA program due to these issues and free up those resources for other projects, it’s not clear if the country will necessarily be able to make good use of them in the near term. Indian officials are separately starting the third iteration of an attempt to buy more than 100 foreign-designed fourth generation fighter jets and build them locally, a separate saga that is itself nearly 20 years old, as well as struggling to squeeze some real capability out of the chronically underwhelming Tejas domestically designed lightweight fighter. The HAL Tejas Mk. 1. , Venkat Mangudi via Wikimedia India still has a clear requirement for a fifth generation fighter and it’s not clear what other options it might have in achieving that goal. It has its own separate Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft program, or AMCA, but is a long-term effort that the FGFA was supposed to have led into in the future. India now wants to link its fourth generation fighter purchases to receiving technical assistance for that project, but it is still unlikely that it would produce any real results soon, even if it were to proceed in a timely fashion. The only other course of action that would offer a true fifth generation capability would be to join the F-35 program, which increasingly appears to be the end goal for many in both the U.S. military and India ‘s defense establishment . However, if Indian officials were disappointed with the Russian control of the Su-57s flight computer, they’d almost certainly have difficulty in extracting any better concessions from defense giant Lockheed Martin. So far, only Israel has the right to modify the Joint Strike Fighter’s Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, and add its own software on top of it – something the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy can’t even do with their jets. A model of India’s AMCA as of 2009., Johnxxx9 via Wikimedia India could decide to accept some level of enhanced domestic cooperation, such as component construction, final assembly, or depot-level maintenance. Lockheed Martin would be unlikely to offer to establish anything approaching a full local production line for the jets even if the U.S. government were to approve the export of highly-sensitive manufacturing knowledge, which is itself extremely unlikely. India could also decide to pursue an advanced fourth-generation design with some limited low-observable features , such as enclosed weapons carriage and radar-absorbent coatings. Boeing is presently offering some of these features as potential options for foreign customers looking to buy the latest iteration of its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and had pitched a similarly modified version of its F-15E Strike Eagle, called the Silent Eagle , to South Korea and other countries. Boeing is in the process of trying to sell Super Hornets to the Indian Navy and will likely submit a bid for the latest iteration of the Indian Air Force fourth generation fighter tender. The prospect of having both services operate the same aircraft, or at least similar variants, could make the aircraft an especially attractive choice in those competitions. Russia has proposed an equally limited upgrade of its Su-35S Flanker-E to the United Arab Emirates and other potential customers. It might be able to incorporate some of those updates onto older Flanker derivatives, such as India’s existing Su-30MKIs. A US Air Force F-35A Joint Strike Fighter., Lockheed Martin Still, if India felt the Su-57 was stealthy enough and it was unwilling to accept the promise that it would become more so in the future, it’s hard to imagine how any of those options would necessarily meet its requirements. It is possible that the Indian Air Force could purchase a smaller amount of one of those upgraded fourth generation designs as a lower-cost interim solution, but it would still only be a stopgap at best. For the Russians, the loss of India as a partner could be even more problematic. Without additional funds from the Indians to help keep the Su-57 program going, the Kremlin might have to scale back its plans for the jet even further. Russia had initially hoped it could have built 150 Su-57s, the bulk of those being final production models, by 2020. Moscow eventually scaled that back to an initial purchase of just a dozen jets. It still had not received all of those aircraft by the end of 2017. A Russian Air Force Su-35S Flanker-E, left, flies with a Su-57. These represent the country’s two most advanced fighter jets at present., AP The Kremlin now claims that serial production will begin by the end of 2018 and that it could purchase as many as 220 aircraft in total, another questionable assertion given the country’s recent defense budget cuts and its massive focus on expensive advanced strategic weapons . In February 2018, the Russian Air Force dispatched a pair of the pre-production jets to Syria, but it’s unlikely they could have performed any useful missions, for tests purposes or otherwise, during a visit that reportedly lasted less than two days . It remains unclear how both parties will decide to proceed now. India’s military procurement process is notoriously long and convoluted, often suffering from accusations of corruption, which could push any new plans for a fifth generation fighter aircraft further into the future. Russia’s own progress on the Su-57 has been painfully slow and despite optimistic pronouncements from the Kremlin and Sukhoi, there’s no guarantee the jets will arrive with the desired features or in anything approaching the numbers that Moscow wants any time soon. We’ll have to wait and see how much, if anything, either side will ultimately be able to salvage from the abortive FGFA program.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 19, 2018",Iraq’s An-32 Cargo Planes Turned Bombers Flew Nearly Twice As Many Strikes As its F-16s,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following a recent strike its F-16IQ Viper multi-role jets flew against ISIS terrorists in neighboring Syria , the Iraqi Air Force has released a detailed infographic showing how many combat and combat support missions each of its aircraft types have flown over the past nearly four years. Of particular note is that the country’s An-32 cargo planes have conducted more airstrikes than either Iraq’s F-16s or its Aero L-159 Advanced Light Combat Aircraft, or ALCA, light attack jets. The Iraqi Air Force released the infographic, with its text unfortunately only in Arabic, on its official social media accounts on April 23, 2018. But the statistics, which cover the period from June 10, 2014 to December 31, 2017, clearly show that the An-32s flew 990 strike missions during that time, almost twice that of the Iraqi F-16 fleet’s 514 sorties and nearly a sixth of the total missions that the aircraft conducted altogether. Neither figure is close to the more than 3,500 strikes that the country’s Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft flew in that same period. It’s also worth noting that the F-16IQs only began flying combat missions in 2015 and it’s unclear how long the Iraqis have employed their An-32s in the bomber role, if they’re still operating the aircraft in this way, and how many of the six total aircraft had or still have the ability to carry out strikes. Official Iraqi Air Force social media accounts have posted pictures of what appear to be An-32s with side-mounted bomb racks as recently as earlier this month, but we don’t know if those images are necessarily new or not. Regardless, per Iraq’s own statistics, even if all of the transports have gone back to more traditional activities, the country’s newer jet combat aircraft are still playing catch-up in terms of total missions flown. The infographic also underscores how important the converted transport planes have been in Iraq’s own, far less publicized air campaign against ISIS. Iraq’s infographic with data on the various missions its aircraft performed between Jun 2014 and December 2017., Iraqi Air Force According to a detailed report from War Is Boring in 2016, Iraq’s armed An-32s were born out of a desperate need for combat airpower after the Iraqi military spectacularly collapsed in the face of the terrorists flooding into the country in 2014. At that time, the country’s first F-16 pilots, along with their aircraft, were still training in Arizona . The only fixed-wing combat aircraft available for immediate strikes were a hodgepodge of sometimes flyable Su-25s from Russia and Iran and AC-208 Combat Caravan light attack aircraft. So, Iraqi authorities decided to turn to Ukraine’s Antonov, the successor to the Soviet-era design bureau of the same name that first developed the An-32, to arm some of the transports to further expand their combat capabilities and do so quickly. Since the An-32 is a derivative of the An-26 , with an almost identical fuselage shape, this was not a particularly difficult proposition. An Iraqi Air Force An-32 with bomb racks in June 2017., Iraqi Air Force Antonov had already developed a method to attach four racks to that older aircraft, two on each side of the fuselage, able to carry 500-pound class bombs, a configuration that reportedly dates back to before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In addition, a special system was installed inside the main cargo bay that allowed the crew to roll up to four more 500-pound class bombs right out of the back of the aircraft. A bombardier using an NKPB-7 optical bombsight in one of the plane’s two side-mounted observation windows would aim the weapons in a method not far removed from how bomber crews did so in World War II. It is not clear if the Iraqis are still using this sighting system. More recent images show Iraqi aircraft with what appears to be a new, single, long pylon on either side of the aircraft that might be able to accommodate multiple 500-pound class bombs or larger munitions. It is also possible this new configuration could be some kind of sensor system, further highlighting the versatility of the aircraft. The mount also appears to hold a large dispenser for decoy flares, another important addition given reports that ISIS has obtained infrared-homing, shoulder-fired, man-portable surface-to-air missiles in the past. A diagram showing the NKPB-7 bombsight., via Odkrywca.pl The Indian Air Force was actually the first to convert its An-32s to use the cargo bay bomber modification and demonstrated their strike capability for the first time during an exercise in 2013. Ukraine also employed similarly armed versions of the An-26 in the open stages of its campaign against Russian-supported separatists in 2014. Of course, converting transport planes into bombers isn’t a particularly new concept, with examples dating back to World War II. It has long offered a low-cost means of rapidly acquiring combat aircraft. The U.S. military, in a way, continues to maintain a similar capability with regards to the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, also known as the Mother of All Bombs or MOAB. The only U.S. Air Force’s MC-130 special operations transports are the aircraft able to employ this weapon, which has a total weight of more than 21,000 pounds, of which more than 80 percent is explosive. However, those weapons have a GPS-aided inertial guidance system. In contrast, most other such bomber conversions of transport planes that remain in use today around the world, such as Iraq’s An-32s, are generally an especially crude method of conducting strikes. We don’t know where and how the Iraqis have employed these armed An-32s, but there were increased reports regarding their use in the lead up to liberating Mosul in 2016 , along with an official video showing Mi-171 helicopters dropping unguided bombs from high altitudes. An Iraqi An-32 with what may be a new, single pylon bomb rack or a sensor system., Iraqi Air Force It is possible, and perhaps likely, that the An-32s were among the factors that contributed to significant reported civilian casualties during the Mosul campaign. The converted transports simply would not have been able to strike targets with high precision, increasing the chances of collateral damage in general, but especially during missions over a densely packed urban area where ISIS in many cases deliberately established positions next to innocent bystanders. Iraq’s recent strike in Syria, which the country’s military very visibly touted as a precision affair involving laser-guided bombs as seen in the video below, could indicate that the country is moving away from its earlier imprecise tactics. Unfortunately, it’s hard to say how regularly the Iraqi Air Force conducts missions using precision-guided munitions. But with its F-16IQs, Su-25s, L-159s, and now South Korean-made T-50 Golden Eagle jet trainer and light attack aircraft, Iraq increasingly has far better options when it comes to carrying out air strikes and appears to have relegated its AC-208s to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. And even though the Vipers are the only aircraft that can employ precision-guided munitions, the Frogfoots, ALCAs, and Golden Eagles can all almost certainly deliver unguided weapons more accurately that the converted transports. The An-32s could still find some use against remote militant camps or compounds, where precision might not be as important as volume of fire and where there is less concern about causing civilian casualties. With ISIS, or some new “ISIS 2.0” iteration of the group, still a threat in Iraq and Syria, air power will almost certainly continue to be an important part of making sure the terrorists are unable to reassert themselves. Earlier in April 2018, ISIS released the first statement from its main spokesman, Abu Hassan Al Muhajir, in 10  months, which notably called for increased attacks on other Arabs, including those in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Palestine, in addition to keeping up the fight against both the United States and Russia in the region. “These are Arabs and are more fierce and vicious against Islam,” Al Muhajir argued in his remarks, according to The New York Times . Another of Iraq’s An-32s., Iraqi Air Force At the same time, it will be important to make sure that any air strikes aren’t doing more harm than good, though. Errant bombs can easily play into hostile propaganda. The armed An-32s appear to have provided an immediate boost combat air power for the Iraqi Air Force, but with so many other, better alternatives available, the aircraft are likely to find themselves flying more traditional missions hauling passengers and cargo. There’s always a possibility that Iraq might reconfigure them again for new roles, too.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 22, 2018",These Handy Graphics Show The Entire Inventories Of The Israeli And Canadian Air Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Aircraft inventories, squadron organization, and basing locations of various air arms around the globe are always of great interest to anyone who keeps an eye on military aviation, and nobody conveys that information better than our good friends at Contemporary Issues Geography . They have mastered the art form of showcasing an air force’s order of battle in a single attractive graphic (like here , here , here , here and here ). With this in mind, we always like so show off their newest works, and this time around they have come through with new panels depicting the Israeli and Canadian Air Forces. We get a lot of questions regarding the inventory of the IAF, especially as to the state of its F-15A-D ‘Baz’ and F-16 fleets . CIGeography has made answering these questions much easier and even provides basing locations for each element of the IAF’s flying force. CIGeography Some interesting takeaways from this chart include the fact that the ‘Flying Dragon’ squadron—the IAF’s dedicated aggressor unit—has just six F-16C jets. Also, although so much is made of the IAF’s Shavit and Eitam fleet, there are only five of these aircraft in total, but apparently the IAF is looking to bolster that force. And always something that was puzzling to us is that the IAF retains a cadre of just ten KC-707 tankers. It seems like such a small fleet versus the country’s large tactical fighter force would be stretched far too thin during a sustained air operation against Iran, at least without the USAF’s help. The Royal Canadian Air Force has been in the news constantly as of late due to the seemingly endless CF-18 replacement fighter saga . But there is much more to the RCAF than just its Hornet contingent, as you can see in the eye-catching chart below. CIgeography When you look at it visually, it’s clear just how much the RCAF depends on the CH-146 Griffon/Twin Huey as the backbone of their vertical lift capability. The youngest of which is two decades old. According to the chart, the Hornet force is made up of 77 jets, but what’s interesting is that nearly 30% of that force is dedicated to training or test and development. This underlines the cost of keeping nearly all tactical fighter pilot training in-house and not outsourcing it to another country’s air arm. Also of note is that six CC-115 Buffalos remain in service, which is truly a wonderful thing. The coolest part about these awesome charts is that you can buy them in poster-sizes, which is an awesome and very unique gift for the aviation lover in your life or for yourself.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 6, 2018",Markings On Scaled Composites’ ARES Confirm Its Connection To Mysterious Model 401 Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The War Zone recently published an exclusive story about Scaled Composites’ stealthy new Model 401 demonstrator aircraft. It featured new candid photographs of one of the stealthy planes and we were able to decode evidence that the two new aircraft seem to have a direct connection to the company’s ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) jet that first flew nearly three decades ago. We even figured out the nicknames of the pair of new aircraft. Now we have confirmation that they are indeed the ‘sons’ of ARES. While attending an experimental aircraft fly-in at Mojave Air and Space Port this weekend, Scott Lowe gave ARES—which was on display—a close inspection. One of the stencils on the flying experimental test platform included a comical “chemtrail tank” inscription. But located just below that was a “world’s greatest dad” sticker like those found on some suburbanite minivans, but instead of silhouettes of a father and son, it was ARES next to two Model 401s. ARES at the Mojave Air and Space Port experimental aircraft fly-in., Scott Lowe The two Model 401 jets are aptly named Deimos and Phobos, which in ancient Greek mythology are the sons of the war god Ares. In our special feature on the new aircraft’s connection to ARES we wrote: The names Phobos and Deimos are extremely important too. Theos.com’s description of their place in Greek mythology reads as such: DEIMOS and PHOBOS were the gods or personified spirits (daimones) of fear. Deimos represented terror and dread, while his brother Phobos was panic, flight and rout. They were sons of the war-god Ares who accompanied their father into battle, driving his chariot and spreading fear in his wake. As sons of Aphrodite, goddess of love, the twins also represented fear of loss. This all makes more sense considering there are actually two Model 401s in existence. Their registrations : N401XD (Deimos) and N401XP (Phobos). The warlike and downright scary nature of their names also alludes to the probability that they are designed for intensive military applications. You have to hand it to Scaled Composites for coming up with such a rich and well-tailored mythological metaphor for the Model 401 program—a program of which we still don’t know if there is an external benefactor or customer. https://www.instagram.com/p/BhiOC6FgBnZ There has been other Model 401 news since our last post as well. The second prototype, N401XD, aka Deimos, has taken to the skies, and it’s not an unmanned variant as was rumored—that is at least not yet. Scaled Composites has built other optionally manned aircraft that be controlled via line-of-sight data-link or they can even have their modular cockpits replaced with satcom communications systems so that they can be controlled beyond line-of-sight remotely. But at this time, both Model 401 aircraft are being flown with human pilots in their cockpits. We have speculated as to what the aircraft might be used for, but some correspondence we received following our most recent “son of ARES” article is worth mentioning. We pointed out that the aircraft’s wings feature somewhat of an extreme dihedral (the wings are angled upward). One source that contacted us noted that this is especially important for providing an optimal, unobstructed line of sight from horizon to horizon for payloads protruding from below the aircraft, such as electro-optical sensors or even laser turrets. This way the payload can maintain a lock on a target near or even above the horizon even when the aircraft is banking. This makes a lot of sense considering there are at least two large payload bays located on the aircraft’s belly, which we pointed out in our last piece. Matt Hartman Even with all this information, we still don’t know who these aircraft are destined for or what exactly their mission will be once they are delivered. Rest assured that the moment we find out the answer to these questions we will report it here at The War Zone.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 17, 2018",Watch This Special Ops Team Toss Their Stealthy Boats And Themselves Out Of A C-17,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We have become somewhat accustomed to seeing special operators jump out of an aircraft and into the ocean along with their rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs), but this week the Navy treated us to a very special video that takes airborne maritime insertion tactics to a whole new level. The video shows Special Warfare Combat-craft Crewmen (SWCCs) of Special Boat Team 20 leaping out of a C-17 behind two of their stealthy Combat Craft Assault (CCA) boats as part of a training evolution. In total, 11 SWCCs followed their rides into the water below. SWCCs are best known for being a waterborne transit service for Navy SEALs but they also run their own independent operations in the world’s hotspots using a variety of special operations watercraft, some of which are quite exotic . The CCA, in particular, has turned into an increasingly popular platform for SWCCs to deploy with, as it is fast, maneuverable, reconfigurable, and it was designed to have a small radar and infrared signature. But above all else, for a 41-foot monohull open-water craft, it is easily deployable. Two can fit in a single C-17, and if need be, they can be airdropped along with their crews. In this case, the boats were launched via the Low-Velocity Airdrop Delivery System (LVADS). The War Zone published a special feature on the shadowy Combat Craft Assault boat, as well as some of its stablemates, back in August of 2017. In it we wrote: From what little we know about the 41-foot long craft, technically known as the CCA Mk. 1, it is low-observable design with a composite material hull and a pair of high-performance engines that could operate with a low likelihood of detection even close to shore. It is reportedly small enough that U.S. Air Force C-17s can airdrop it directly into a given body of water, likely using an arrangement similar to the Maritime Craft Aerial Delivery System (MCADS) for the Naval Special Warfare community’s 36-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIB), which you can see in the video below. The Navy specifically purchased the CCAs for medium range missions to insert or extract special operators or to discreetly conduct coastal surveillance, according to one unclassified briefing. Side-folding panels at the rear of the boat may offer additional protection, but there are no obvious provisions for mounted weapons. These fixtures are built inside the boat’s clean outer mold-line or are retractable/removable when not in use to maintain the CCA’s stealthy shape. The crew and passengers would undoubtedly carry individual weapons for self-protection as well. Each craft has a sensor mast with what may be a small surface search radar, as well as an electro-optical sensor turret with day- and night-vision capabilities. One unclassified 2014 technical report says that at least some of the boats had a satellite communications antenna flush in the top of the bow… The Navy received the first of these craft from United States Marine, Inc. sometime between 2012 and 2013, though development had started as early as 2010. Production continued until 2014 and the CCA was only expected to reach full operational capability during the 2017 fiscal year. At present, the craft are split between Special Boat Teams 12 and 20, situated at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia respectively. Lockheed Martin has taken over responsibility for maintaining and otherwise supporting CCAs. Although the previously shy CCAs are becoming more visible to the public, SWCCs became better known following their cameo appearance in the 2012 action movie Act of Valor. That film, which used real military personnel as actors, showed SWCCs executing a hot extraction in a riverine environment, which was probably the most memorable action sequence in the film. It’s pretty amazing to think that the Navy, with the help of the USAF, can just plunk down the kind of capability the SWCCs and their CCAs provide nearly anywhere on the world’s wet surface where a C-17 can survive above. And clearly SWCCs practice a dangerous art, one in which even the flying fish can get you!: Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 6, 2017",Gunfire Heard At Saudi Royal Palace In Riyadh As Rumors Of Attempted Coup Mount (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Details remain very sketchy but there is elevating talk that a coup attempt has been made against King Salman of Saudi Arabia . Heavy gunfire was heard around the sprawling royal palace complex overnight in the Kingdom, and various reports state that the King had been moved to a safe bunker complex at an air base nearby. Other sources say it may be a terror attack or an assault by Houthi forces that infiltrated the country, or even the result of a small drone overflying a palace checkpoint. So at this point, we really don’t have a definitive answer as to what is going on. It’s not as if the crown doesn’t have its enemies among major Saudi military and business power players. After arresting, holding captive , and stripping funds and powerful positions from some of the country’s most elite royals, and pushing through reforms and a foreign policy agenda that would have been considered radical a year ago, there is no doubt that the sitting royal family is a major target. King Salman’s son, Mohammad Bin Salman, who is widely viewed as the primary force behind moderate reforms made under his father’s reign, and will likely be the named king in the near future, is probably the biggest target for those in the Royal apparatus that diverge from his vision for the country. Update: 2:35pm PST— Reuters is reporting that an unnamed Saudi official told them King Salman wasn’t at the palace during the incident, he was at a family farm in nearby Diriya. The source goes on to say that the gunfire came from troops shooting at a drone on orders after it crossed over a palace checkpoint. Aljazeera is reporting the following: “The official spokesman of Riyadh police said on Saturday that security forces “dealt with” an unauthorized, small drone-type toy after spotting it at a security point in Khuzama neighborhood, state-run news agency SPA said.” Update: 2:55pm PST— One of our friends and favorite sources on Twitter posted this interesting tidbit. It could be totally unrelated but the timing does seem interesting: Also, our own Joseph Trevithick pointed out that non-ballistic attacks on Saudi palaces , religious sites , and bases inside the country usually get little press but they have been consistently occurring in recent months. A running list of them has been put up here , just check out 2017. Joe notes that almost all of these events are blamed on Iranian-backed actors. Update: 3:18pm PST— Saudi officials have released a statement that also claims the incident involved a hobby drone. “The report said a remote-controlled toy aircraft was flown into a security cordon in the Khuzama neighborhood of the city around 7:50 p.m. The report gave no information about who had been controlling the drone and said police were investigating the incident.” Many are wondering why the King has not shown himself on television to reaffirm his grip on power.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We are spoiled with amazing footage shot from inside the cockpits of U.S. Navy aircraft as they go about their missions around the globe. In fact, the videos are so prevalent in the GoPro era that squadrons have become masters at producing home-made but increasingly stunning cruise and other videos to celebrate and showcase major occasions . So it’s not like we haven’t seen cockpit videos of carrier catapult shots before. But this one takes the cake not because of how it was filmed but by the audio that goes along with it. The pilot, who belongs to Naval Fighter Attack Squadron Two (VFA-2) Bounty Hunters—a unit with a long and rich history—performs his pre-launch checklist like he was auctioning it off on the courthouse steps. The sheer energy this pilot exudes during the cat-shot is infections and it makes us all wish we were sitting behind him in his F/A-18F. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Evan Levesque (@rhinodrvr) We were able to get a little background on the viral video. The clip was shot at the end of squadron’s WESTPAC deployment which just wrapped up, and that cruise was historic for a number of reasons . As the carrier approached the west coast of the United States, Carrier Air Wing Two conducted its fly-off, and that’s when the clip was shot.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 27, 2018",China Touts Fusion Progress As New Details On Lockheed Martin’s Reactor Emerge,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. China, which is reportedly hard at work on a host of advanced technologies for both military and civilian applications , has given foreign journalists a close look at its potentially revolutionary fusion energy project, which they claim has produced the longest man-made nuclear reaction of this type ever. The tour came as additional details have come to light regarding another advanced fusion reactor program at Lockheed Martin, which recently obtained a patent for portions of its own design. Earlier in April 2018, the BBC got an inside look at the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak , or EAST, which sits within the Dongpu Science Island , a large research campus that is situated on lakeshore peninsula in China’s Anhui Province. The Hefei Institutes of Physical Science is directly responsible for the project, working under the direction of the government-run Chinese Academy of Sciences . “Fusion is going to require huge breakthroughs from scientists and engineers as well as a lot of financial backing from the government,” Song Yuntao, Deputy Director in charge of EAST, told the BBC. “It’s a project which costs so much but personally I think it’s going to be great for the sustainable development of mankind.” Song’s remarks downplay just how revolutionary practical fusion power could be for humanity. Unlike a fission reaction , in which atoms collide and release energy, fusion is the result of particles being forced together at extremely high temperatures until they fuse into a heavier nucleus. China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak., Chinese Academy of Sciences When that happens, there is an exponentially greater discharge of energy compared to both nuclear fission and the burning of a traditional fossil fuel or similar chemical reactions. More importantly, the system doesn’t produce byproducts that are harmful to the ozone layer and needs only a small amount material in its core to function. On top of that, the isotopes in question are far less dangerous than those necessary for nuclear fission and therefore less likely to create a widespread radiological incident if the reactor fails catastrophically. So, at least in theory, fusion has, since the 1920s, offered the promise of nearly limitless and exceptionally cheap energy that produces far less immediate pollution and leftover waste material than existing power generation methods. Unfortunately, for the reaction to work, the system needs to survive temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees Fahrenheit, as well as the resulting pressures, and do for an extended period of time. First invented in the 1950s, ring-shaped tokamaks , such as EAST, use a powerful magnetic field to contain the reaction. The Chinese researchers told the BBC that they’ve been able to sustain a single reaction for more than 100 seconds, which, if true, would stand as a world record. The length of the reaction “gets longer every year,” the British news outlet reported, citing statements from officials at EAST. “Here [at EAST] they’re already talking about goals which are 10 times as long, at temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius [180,000,032 degrees Fahrenheit].” A view from inside the EAST fusion reactor., Chinese Academy of Sciences The problem with this claim, though, is that the team at EAST first said they broke the 100-second milestone in 2016 . If there had been substantial progress since then, it seems unclear why the Chinese would have declined to share that with the visiting journalists. The length of the reaction is also just one part of the fusion puzzle. The reactor also has to be able to withstand discharging the resulting energy in a useful way over a protracted period of time, which also involves significant temperatures and pressure strains. The Tore Supra , another tokamak in France, holds the record for plasma discharge duration at over six minutes . In addition, China’s EAST suffers from the same problems that have plagued tokamaks for decades, chiefly that they continue to be inefficient producing relatively little energy despite their large size and the high cost of operation. The Chinese reactor sits inside a building the size of a two-story apartment block, according to BBC’s description. It costs $15,000 just to turn it on each day and it’s not clear how long it stays on and how much testing gets done in the process. Without any data on the reactors power generation capabilities, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to accurately gauge how close to any real breakthrough the team at EAST might be in reality. These issues have led other researchers to question whether a tokamak might ever be able to serve as the basis for a practical reactor. Dr. Thomas McGuire, head of a team working on a novel Compact Fusion Reactor program, or CFR, for Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works advanced projects division, had this to say on the matter in an interview with Aviation Week in 2014: “The problem with tokamaks is that ‘they can only hold so much plasma, and we call that the beta limit,’ McGuire says. Measured as the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure, the beta limit of the average tokamak is low, or about ‘5% or so of the confining pressure,’ he says. Comparing the torus to a bicycle tire, McGuire adds, ‘if they put too much in, eventually their confining tire will fail and burst—so to operate safely, they don’t go too close to that.’” McGuire’s team believes they may have found an answer with their new, now patented confinement chamber, or embodiment. Aviation Week described this new system as such: “The CFR will avoid these issues by tackling plasma confinement in a radically different way. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. ‘So for us, instead of a bike tire expanding into air, we have something more like a tube that expands into an ever-stronger wall,’ McGuire says. The system is therefore regulated by a self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. The CFR is expected to have a beta limit ratio of one. ‘We should be able to go to 100% or beyond,’ he adds.” Other scientists in the field have been equally incredulous about this new approach, questioning the basic underlying concept , as well as Lockheed Martin’s aggressive schedule for new developments. In 2014, McGuire said he expected his team would be able to build a working example of the reactor within five years and a practical, production design within 10. A diagram depicting the basic shape and features of Lockheed Martin’s Compact Fusion Reactor concept., Lockheed Martin New information that we at The War Zone have received by way of our good friend Stephen Trimble, chief of Flightglobal’s Americas Bureau, makes it clear that Lockheed Martin remains committed to the project. At the same time, it also calls into question whether they’ll be able to stick to their original timetable. An official, unclassified briefing from August 2017 shows that McGuire’s team has crafted at least four iterative experimental reactor designs, as well as an unknown number of subvariants. The most recent test example at that time was known as the T4B. A slide from August 2017 Lockheed Martin briefing outlining plans for future experimental prototypes., Lockheed Martin via Stephen Trimble But the goals for the follow-one T5 and T6 indicate that the previous reactors were not even fully functional. The T5 would provide data on heating and inflating the plasma.  Essentially, as the temperature of the plasma goes up, it expands, so it is necessary to test to make the physical limits of the confinement chamber. The T6 appeared to be the first one Lockheed Martin would subject to a more serious high-temperature experiment. Lockheed Martin would only conduct a true, full-power demonstration with reactor large enough to represent the notional production version with the T7. Further experimental reactors would continue to validate the design on the way to the final, practical TX reactor. The briefing says that the company now expects to have a workable compact reactor capable of generating a continuous 100 megawatts of power – the goal from the beginning – sometime in the 2020s. This is an at least five-year delay over the original schedule and is far vaguer than the previous developmental timelines. Another slide from the Lockheed Martin briefing noting the new “2020s” timeframe for having a practical fusion reactor., Lockheed Martin via Stephen Trimble Separately, in 2017, one independent scientist said that the data available suggested that prototype designs were no longer truly “compact.” Lockheed Martin had initially said that the reactor could weight as little as 20 tons, small enough to fit on the back of a typical semi-truck. Updated specifications, however, indicated that the experimental designs would have had to balloon to 100 times that size. Lockheed Martin has long pitched the project as high-risk and high-reward. It’s hard to argue with that, given the undeniably game-changing potential of fusion power, but it seems as unclear as ever when and if the rewards might materialize. Still, quickly building sequential experimental reactors for increasingly more complex tests does reflect the kind of rapid prototyping Skunk Works has historically excelled at and which has generated real and significant results in the past with regards to other systems. Potential applications for Lockheed Martin’s Compact Fusion Reactor as depicted in their patent for portions of the confinement chamber., USPTO Increasingly energy-hungry , the Chinese government seems to have come to a similar conclusion about the value of investing heavily in fusion energy and is clearly committed to the EAST reactor experiment, regardless of its actual progress so far. Song, the project Deputy Director, told BBC his team had an equally aggressive set of goals to Lockheed Martin, too. “The demand for energy is huge in every country and China has a roadmap for fusion-generated power,” he said. “We want to complete the design for a test fusion reactor within five years.” That schedule would put China in competition with Lockheed Martin for who might be first to produce a viable fusion reactor. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for news that either party is getting closer to meeting those ambitious, but world-changing goals.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 29, 2019",Lockheed Should Restart the Raptor Line If Japan Wants An F-22-F-35 Hybrid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reuters has published a report that came as little surprise to us at The War Zone regarding Tokyo’s interest in having Japanese industry work with Lockheed Martin to develop a semi-indigenous fighter that combines the best attributes of the F-35 Lightning and F-22 Raptor. The Reuters report states in part: “Lockheed has discussed the idea with Japanese defense ministry officials and will make a formal proposal in response to a Japanese request for information (RFI) after it receives permission from the U.S. government to offer the sensitive military technology, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the proposal. The decision on whether to release parts of the highly classified aircraft designs and software to help Japan stay ahead of Chinese advances will test President Donald Trump’s promise to overhaul his country’s arms export policy. The proposed aircraft “would combine the F-22 and F-35 and could be superior to both of them,” said one of the sources.” USAF Although Japan has put forward notional Raptor-like designs, what they could also be talking about here is merging the higher kinematic performance and low-observability of the F-22 with the F-35’s smarter attributes—including updated avionics, mission computers, and sensors—as well as new lower-maintenance skin coatings. We at The War Zone have posited exactly this, writing the following in a 2016 article dubbed ‘Just Allow The F-22 To Be Exported To Japan Already’: “Japan always wanted the F-22—badly. But nearly two decades ago, congress barred the super-fighter from being exported to anyone , including America’s closest allies. This act slashed Japan’s F-22 dreams, although they kept asking. Times have changed, and with Japan facing down a drastically more aggressive and advanced Chinese military—one that has territorial ambitions in direct conflict with Japan’s own claims. The tension has manifested in the air-to-air realm, with Japan intercepted a whopping 199 Chinese aircraft between April and June of this year, and those intercepts are getting more aggressive. Combined with threats from North Korea, this new reality has been taken very seriously by Japan, which has put in place aggressive initiatives to upgrade existing fighter aircraft and acquire new ones with greatly enhanced lethality. The F-22’s technologies are also no longer experimental. In fact, they are decades old. In many ways, the exportable F-35 is more technologically advanced than the F-22. At this point, the export ban on the F-22 is more of a protectionist tool to bolster the F-35’s production numbers than a national security play. But now a $40 billion tender is being put forward by Japan to indigenously develop or import a new super fighter design. Although Mitsubishi’s X-2 technology demonstrator has just taken flight, it is just that: a technology demonstrator. Despite inaccurate press reports that the X-2 is a prototype, there’s is no guarantee it will make it into production in the coming decade. Think of it more as a Bird Of Prey than a YF-22 . The USAF is finally looking at restarting the Raptor production line, but the chances of that happening are almost nil, because doing so would directly challenge the F-35 program. And although the F-22 is the only existing fighter that can actually fulfill Japan’s $40 billion tender, it will likely be shot down by Lockheed, the USAF and congress. Meanwhile, Japan is already an F-35 customer, with 42 of the jets on order. This sounds crazy but there may be an opportunity here for Japan to foot the cost of restarting F-22 production, which is supposedly the major barrier keeping the USAF from buying more Raptors. However, the reality is that a dollar spent on a new F-22 is a dollar taken away from producing more F-35s. So although the increasingly positive platitudes from high-up USAF officials have hinted that they would love to have more F-22s, the abstract effects of doing so are politically unpalatable. Anything to protect the F-35—and I mean anything . So what we will probably end up with is a situation where a major US defense aerospace prime contractor, let’s say Lockheed Martin, works with Japan’s Iron Triangle supported defense industrial base to build, well, pretty much an F-22, although not an exact copy. This will come at far higher cost than just restarting the line, but doing so will not endanger the F-35’s budgetary supremacy within the USAF and the Pentagon as a whole. This has actually been done before to a certain extent, see the Mitsubishi-Lockheed F-2 , Japan’s semi-indigenous F-16. These jets, of which Japan bought a similar number of around 100, ended up costing well over $100 million each when they could have just bought advanced block F-16s for a third of that price and left comparatively little capability on the table. It all sounds pretty stupid, doesn’t it? Here there is a real opportunity to get the F-22 back in production and likely in an upgraded fashion with more advanced and serviceable avionics and other components, potentially all on Japan’s dime. The USAF could piggyback the JASDF order and bolster its fleet of just 183 F-22s (of which only about 125 are combat coded at any given time) for largely the unit cost alone. But this super-logical offering will likely never happen, because nothing can endanger the F-35, both from a manufacturer’s point of view and Washington’s. Japan is slated to make its “F-3” fighter choice in the summer of 2018 so there is still a couple of years for Washington to come to its senses and make an about-face on its F-22 embargo, although I wouldn’t hold my breath.” Fast forward a couple years and the F-35 program has progressed past the point of no return and President Trump is looking at pretty much any opportunity it can to boost sales of weapons to allied nations. With this in mind, the chances of such an initiative actually happening have increased dramatically. The biggest question is does Japan have the financial capacity to take down such an expensive project, especially considering other new competing priorities. These include everything from acquiring a cruise missile , to setting up Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense batteries, to fielding F-35Bs on its helicopter carriers. The $366M Mitsubishi X-2 technology demonstrator took its final flight last year after a relatively short life. Apparently, technical difficulties impacted the program and it was clear that Japan would need a deep foreign partnership in order to field a stealth fighter that could also benefit Japanese industry: What’s also new is that the USAF has completed a study that looked into what it would cost to put an updated F-22 back into production. The basic findings were: -Approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s -The total includes an estimate of approximately $7 billion to $10 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement costs -An estimated cost of $206 million to $216 million per aircraft (the last F-22 produced had a unit cost of $137 million) That cost may be too high for the USAF to stomach, but for Japan, it’s highly unlikely they will be able to field something superior to an updated F-22 for anywhere near less. It’s also likely that once the U.S.-specific politics of putting the Raptor back into production are removed from the equation, the cost of doing so would drop. Lockheed just rolled-out Japan’s first of 40 F-35s on order., Lockheed Martin But if Japan is willing to buy an updated Raptor instead of developing a near identical but still unique design , clearly doing so would present a mutually beneficial opportunity. If the U.S. would become a minority stakeholder in an F-22 production line restart of sorts, with the intent on buying a number of airframes to bolster the USAF’s undersized and cherished F-22 fleet, then the opportunity could work out for both parties. Once again, the F-35 lobby will be strongly against such a move even though the F-35’s future is now assured. Any fighter dollar given to another program is one less spent on it, but the possibility that the USAF could acquire a Raptor 2.0 of sorts without bearing the vast majority of the non-recurring restart and development costs is an incredible proposition. If Japan is looking to buy a couple hundred fighters and the U.S. was to add onto that order, the unit cost for each jet would plummet as well. As for Japan, it would benefit by realizing lowered unit costs, technology transfer, and also by being a key supplier for certain components of the jets built for both Japan and the United States. The potential to export the jet could also be an added benefit, but this would likely be curtailed by the U.S. in order to protect F-35 sales abroad. But above all else, Japan will be able to lower its risk substantially by buying into an existing and proven airframe, improving upon it, and will benefit from the full backing of the U.S. government and industry in doing so. Don’t think for a second that Japan is not willing to pay through the nose for a semi-indigenous modified fighter design with deep industry offsets. The F-2 ended up costing nearly the price of an F-35A today, and even then its radar proved to be highly problematic. Japan could have bought late-block F-16s for nearly a third of the price of each F-2 while realizing only minimal negative impacts in terms of some capabilities., USAF Also, keep in mind Donald Trump’s extremely close relationship with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Approving Japan to get ‘the very best’ while also lining the pockets of big defense contractors seems like a very attractive proposition for Donald Trump. And it seems pretty clear that when it comes to weapons export to Japan, Trump is willing and ready to give Abe what he wants. We will watch how this story develops closely, but if the Pentagon was smart, they would embrace an upgraded F-22 restart with Japan, and if Tokyo is willing to foot the majority of the bill for doing so, the USAF would be nuts not to take advantage of it.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 9, 2019",Huge Strategic Exercise Is Underway With Half The B-2 Fleet Airborne Over The U.S. (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It started around 4pm PST when no less than a dozen KC-10 tankers began to pop up over the central United States. Around the same time, spotters in Minneapolis-St. Paul looked up to see a quartet of B-2 bombers barreling their way towards the southwest, their contrails streaking across the sky. It seems that two other groups of B-2s, another four-ship formation and a two-ship formation, followed shortly after. That is half the B-2 fleet in the air together at one time—something was clearly going on. Not long after those sightings, reports of a pair of B-52 bombers heading east across the midwest popped up, one of those aircraft has since flown directly over Manhattan on its way across the Atlantic, while its wingman peeled off to the south, heading down the eastern seaboard of the United States. B-52 flying over Manhattan before heading out across the Atlantic. , Source Meanwhile, The War Zone was pointed to the fact that large concentrations of KC-135 tankers have been amassed at Moses Lake in Washington State, as well as in Phoenix. Some of the aircraft came from units based far from American shores. Now an E-4B airborne command post has launched out of Andrews AFB. These aircraft function as a flying Pentagon during a crisis and the National Command Authorities can wage war from them and initiate the release of nuclear weapons from anywhere on the planet. It’s quite possible that all these movements are not directly related, but at least the B-2 and KC-10 part of it looks very similar to the last iteration of an exercise nicknamed Neptune Falcon. During Neptune Falcon 2016, the U.S. Air Force’s 509th Bomb Wing and the Missouri Air National Guard’s 131st Bomb Wing, both based at Whiteman Air Force Base, launched 10 B-2s in rapid succession, according to an issue of The Warrior , Whiteman’s official news magazine. Additional information on Neptune Falcon is relatively sparse, but various editions of The Warrior describe it is an “annual combatant command exercise” that validates “readiness to execute a key Operations Plan.” It seems almost certain the combatant command in question is U.S. Strategic Command. The operations plan it mentioned maybe OPLAN 8010 , which defines how the U.S. military would go about launching a nuclear strike . Ten B-2s is basically nearly the whole nuclear combat-ready inventory, and even then it takes a lot of hard work to get all those jets in the same air at the same time. We will keep you updated as to how this exercise unfolds and we have reached out to Strategic Command for more information on what is clearly a huge test of readiness and a major show of force. Update: 5:11am PST— It’s official, according to NOTAMs the exercise is indeed Neptune Falcon or a variation of that exercise. The B-2s, going by callsign ‘Reaper,’ are still up along with the tankers. An elongated rectangle block of airspace over the northern U.S., running roughly from Great Falls, Montana to just past Minot AFB in North Dakota, has been set aside. Another block of airspace reserved for the exercise sits northwest of the Nevada Test and Training Range . All told, this is likely the simulation of a long-range nuclear strike or global air power mission without leaving the United States. NOTAM After plugging in the coordinates from the NOTAM here’s what we get., Skyvector.com Update: 10:00am PST— U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), which oversees the service’s strategic bomber, intercontinental ballistic missile, and supporting units, has given Air Force Magazine a short, official statement confirming that this massive aerial display was a training exercise, but little else. U.S. Strategic Command has passed our separate queries to AFGSC, as well, and we will be sure to add an additional update if and when we hear back. Update: 11:40am PST— We at the War Zone have now received the exact same statement from AFGSC. “We don’t have any further information at this time,” a spokesperson for the command said when we asked it might be possible to confirm this was indeed the latest iteration of Exercise Neptune Falcon, as well as obtain additional information about the event. Update: 12:40pm PST— An Air Force spokesperson at Nellis Air Force Base has now confirmed that this flurry of aerial activity was indeed related to Neptune Falcon, as well as another exercise called Neptune Hawk, both of which began on April 16 and are set to wrap up on May 5, 2018. These exercises, which included personnel from across the U.S. military, “are joint air interoperability exercises designed to maintain readiness and evaluate employment capabilities in a realistic training environment,” they added.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jan 9, 2018",Russia Put Up A Smoke Screen To Hide Delivery of S-300 SAMs To Syria According To Claim,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After the U.S.-led missile strikes on Syrian regime chemical weapons sites, the Russian government responded with a number of vague and unspecified threats, including the suggestion it could reconsider selling S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad. Now there is a report that Russia is delivering these and other weapons to Syria’s government, including one saying it is doing so under the cover of an actual physical smoke screen, as well as reinforcing its own air defense posture in the country. As of April 20, 2018, there were reports that numerous Russian-flagged roll-on-roll-off freighters were docked in the Syrian port city of Tartus, which is also home to a Russian naval base .  For years now, there has been a steady parade of these and other types of cargo-carrying ships to Syria, as the Kremlin continues to resupply both its own forces in the country and those of its client Assad. In this case, though, it could indicate a surge in deliveries to restock the regime’s arsenal or expand its capabilities. “A few years ago at the request of our partners, we decided not to supply S-300s to Syria,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the BBC in an interview on April 16, 2018. “Now that this outrageous act of aggression was undertaken by the US, France and UK, we might think how to make sure that the Syrian state is protected.” In the immediate aftermath of the American, British, and French missile strikes on Syria in the early hours of April 14, 2018, Russian Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoy, Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, also said Russia would reconsider the S-300 deal . On April 19, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s personal spokesperson Dmitri Peskov declined to confirm or deny this was the case in response to a direct question from state-run media outlet TASS . “We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences,” Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov had also said in more nebulous remarks on April 14, 2018. “All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.” On April 20, 2017, Zvezda, the Russian Ministry of Defense’s official television channel, posted a video online that hyped the capabilities of the modernized S-300PMU-2 “Favorit” variant specifically and again indicated there was a possibility the Kremlin could deliver the weapons to Syrian forces. Russia has already deployed this system with its own contingent in the country, as well. But rumors are now swirling that S-300s for Assad’s government were among the actual cargo on at least one of the ships in Tartus. A pro-regime source on social media said it was even more likely this was the case since the ships’ crews, or personnel on the docks, had deployed actual smoke screens to shield their activities. This was reportedly an effort to blind foreign spy planes, drones, or satellites from observing the offloading of sensitive equipment, but it’s unclear how well such countermeasures would necessarily work. American manned and unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft do routinely peer into Syria while flying over international waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The smoke would blind any electro-optical cameras and could defeat some infrared optics depending on the exact chemical and physical composition of the screen. Still, many of these aircraft, such as the RQ-4 Global Hawks that online flight tracking software routinely spots in the area, carry imaging radars and multi-spectral cameras specifically in order to be able to pierce through these types of obscurants. In an age where so many people have cell phones with cameras in them, the smoke screen could be more about preventing average citizens from grabbing images of advanced military equipment and posting them on social media, as has happened with other major Russian military developments in Syria in the past. However, one would also imagine that if there was a smoke screen, that this would have been intriguing enough to warrant a few pictures itself. A sample multi-spectral camera image, at right, compared to a standard visual camera image of the same target area, at left. Notable are the chemical plumes in the multi-spectral image that aren’t visible to the naked eye, but also do not prevent the camera from capturing the outlines of the plane on the ground., National Guard Bureau via FOIA But, as yet, we no additional evidence or independent confirmation to support this claim or indicate that any actual S-300s have arrived in Syria. In addition, the first reports that Russian ships were offloading in Tartus came on April 18, 2018. The most likely ship in question, the Alexandr Tkachenko , transited the Bosphorus strait, which links the Black Sea to the Mediterranean on April 13, 2018. It therefore almost certainly loaded its cargo in Russia before the American-led missile strikes and the Russian threats to send S-300s to Assad. That’s not to say that we don’t know if the ships were carrying any military gear, though. Alexandr Tkachenko was very visibly carrying a mix of Project 03160 Raptor inshore or riverine patrol boats, BMK-T bridge erection boats, and various trucks in the open on its top deck as it headed to Syria. Additional vehicles, weapons, or other equipment – which could include the reported S-300s – would have been in the hold. Another piece of military gear was visible on the deck of the Sparta II as it headed toward Tartus on April 19, 2018. The BMK-Ts are worth highlighting, given that we at The War Zone have previously noted that there are indications that the Syrian government’s river-crossing capabilities are extremely limited . At the same time, pontoon bridge and mobile ferry type systems are essential for Assad’s troops looking to rapidly move back and forth across the Euphrates River into areas under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab forces in the continued absence of purpose-built bridges. It is very likely that such equipment played an important role in getting a battalion-sized force of Assad-aligned militia and Kremlin-linked Russian mercenaries over the Euphrates near the city Deir ez-Zor, where they went on to attack American troops and their partners. Combined with the Raptor boats, this might be a sign that the Syrian regime is looking to step up operations into eastern Syria, or otherwise reinforce its presence along the river, which largely serves as the de facto boundary with American forces. And whether or not the Russians have been working to expand the Syrian government’s own air defense capabilities, they do appear to be reinforcing their own posture in the wake of the American-orchestrated strikes. Since that operation occurred, a number of additional Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have appeared around Russia’s Tartus naval base, as well as its Khmeimim Air Base further north in Syria’s Latakia governorate. At Tartus, at least one of these air defense vehicles was situated out on a pier at Tartus, where it would be well positioned to defend against attacks on ships in the harbor. Elsewhere, another one of the other newly apparent Pantsir-S1 positions was guarding a larger S-400 surface-to-air missile system. The Pantsir-S1, which has both short-range surface-to-air missiles and a pair of 30mm automatic cannons, along with its own onboard fire control radar, is well suited for point defense against aircraft and smaller targets, including drones and cruise missiles. The Russians have long claimed the system, which they have also supplied to Assad’s forces, has developed a particularly stellar record in Syria, including defending against unmanned aircraft and improvised rockets. Overall, these deployments are not necessarily surprising. Pantsir-S1 is by far the most credible point defense Russian forces in Syria have to defend their critical infrastructure in the country against a cruise missile attack. It also helps explain why they have hurried delivered these same systems to Assad’s forces. And in 2017, Russia officially linked its air defense assets in Syria with those of Assad’s military. This seemed to be a clear attempt to make the United States and its partners think twice about striking the regime again after an earlier missile strike against Shayrat Air Base . With that apparently not having deterred the latest American, British, and French strikes, the Kremlin may be trying to once against make the prospect of similar future operations more complicated and risky. They could also see a need to bolster Assad’s own air defense posture in some way, or at least give the appearance of doing so, after the Syrian military’s absolutely humiliating inability to respond to the incoming missile barrage. The Syrian Ministry of Defense posted the video below online on April 17, 2018. It shows various air defense systems the country has in service, but does not include any evidence of S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7Yq5oqzbAw0 Despite extremely dubious claims from the Russian ministry of defense, Syria’s air defenders, including those equipped with Pantsir-S1s and other Russian-supplied short-to-medium range air defense systems, do not appear to have shot down any of the incoming missiles, or at least enough of them to keep them from totally obliterating their targets. On top of that, according to one report, they only managed to fire two surface-to-air missiles as the strike was occurring and fired dozens of additional missiles blindly at nothing after the damage was done. Any new S-300s could also simply go toward expanding the size and overall capabilities Russia’s own air defense posture in the country. If does turn out that there were any of these weapons on the Alexandr Tkachenko , it could indicate the Kremlin was already looking to bolster these defenses in light of very public threats of strikes from President Donald Trump and others leading up to the actual operation on April 14, 2018. Separately, Iran appears to be, or at least have been, considering a similar response to growing Israeli strikes on its interests in Syria. On April 8, 2018, one of Israel’s recent operations reportedly destroyed an Iranian Tor-M1 short-to-medium range surface-to-air missile system at Tiyas Air Base, or T4, near the city of Homs. In the end, regardless of whether the Russians did or didn’t ship any additional S-300s to Syria for its own forces or to deliver to Assad, the Kremlin clearly remains determined to protect its interests in Syria. It is visibly continuing to pour more materiel into the country, activities that run counter to Putin’s claims in December 2017 that Russia had achieved total victory and would be withdrawing the bulk of its forces.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Residents of lower Manhattan in New York City got a bit of a scare recently as MH-60 Black Hawk and MH-6 Little Bird helicopters from the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment went zooming between skyscrapers as part of a training exercise. But it’s hardly the first time the U.S. military, and the Night Stalkers in particular, have caused a stir with similar so-called “ realistic urban training ” events, or RUTs. This particular exercise occurred overnight on April 17-18, 2018 and involved at least two MH-60s and two MH-6s, likely carrying additional special operators. According to witnesses, there may have been two additional MH-6 helicopters as well. A subsequent statement from the New York Police Department said that the activities would be confined to areas around the Verrazano and Brooklyn Bridges, as well as near Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. The helicopters flew low enough to pass right by peoples’ apartments, rattlingly windows and otherwise causing everything to shake. “Didn’t see them but my whole apartment shook and we hit the floor,” one of many concerned citizens posted on Twitter . So far, there is no additional information about what specific “targets” the special operations forces assaulted or the exercise’s overall scenario. There were also reports that a Staten Island Ferry went sailing down the Hudson River flanked by police boats. It is possible that the special operators rappelled onto the vessel in response to a mock terrorist attack or hostage scenario . In addition, the day before the apparent main event, a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command U-28A spy plane was also spotted on online flight tracking software orbiting in the same general area. This single-engine aircraft, which carries electro-optical and infrared video cameras and signals intelligence systems, was likely conducting a mock intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission ahead of the simulated raid itself. Though separate and distinct from rare demonstrations it uses for public relations purposes , the U.S. military still typically describes these sorts of training exercises as a win-win for everyone involved. Special operators get a chance to run through training scenarios in a “live” urban area full of actual potential hazards and bystanders otherwise going about their business and state and municipal authorities sometimes get the opportunity to send National Guard elements, law enforcement personnel, or other first responders to join in and get unique training experience in the process. For instance, in 2014, special operators from Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and 7th Special Forces Group and the U.S. Air Force’s 22nd Special Tactics Squadron conducted one such exercise, nicknamed Objective Indigo , in South Carolina’s capital Columbia. This event also included members of the South Carolina Air and Army National Guard and the Columbia Police Department’s SWAT Team. Since they offer unique benefits, even over exercises that occur in special U.S. military urban training facilities , these sorts of events occur with some regularity across the country every year, both at night and during the day. In some cases, they can go essentially unnoticed, as was the case with Objective Indigo, as well as another night-time exercise in 2015 in which elements of Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) launched a simulated water-borne raid on a warehouse in Los Angeles, California. Marine Raiders take part in an urban warfare exercise in Los Angeles, CA., DoD There is only likely to be increasing demand for these kinds of exercises in the future as the U.S. military, and U.S Special Operations Command in particular, become more concerned about future conflicts in densely populated “ megacities .” But in large American metropolitan areas, such as New York City, which anecdotally “never sleeps,” these realistic exercises often create some level of confusion, or worse. A number of New Yorkers reportedly called 911 in something of a panic during this latest incident, with some saying they were worried the low-flying aircraft might have actually been a terrorist attack akin to 9/11. Residents complained vocally on Twitter that the New York Police Department’s official social media alert had gone up after the exercise was already underway and possibly even over entirely. Although New York is clearly an amazing urban training environment, its population is likely uniquely sensitive to the presence of low-flying helicopters. This is not just because of the tight security situation in and around the city, but also because the movement of helicopters around the dense metropolis is strictly regulated . They cannot fly over the city at will and are restricted to landing at a small number of periphery heliports based along Manhattan’s shoreline. So just seeing helicopters of any type zipping through Manhattan may be alarming enough to some. An MH-6 in action., US Army Back in December of 2016, a daytime training exercise related to a contingency plan to protect then president-elect Donald Trump, similarly gave the Big Apple’s denizens a moment of pause. In that case, a single HC-130 Combat King rescue plane and a pair of HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search and rescue helicopters, both from the New York Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing, flew various orbits over midtown Manhattan. There are many more examples of similar U.S. military exercises that have gone less than smoothly, at least from a public relations standpoint. In 2008, residents of Portland, Oregon were disconcerted to see special operators in helicopters overhead, with an alert about the training exercise only going out to the general public an hour ahead of time. Media attention subsequently became so intense that the organizers had to move the whole event to another area entirely. The armed version of the Little Bird, the AH-6 , is rolled off a spec-ops MC-130. The small and nimble helicopters can be airborne within minutes of being unloaded., DoD Here how The War Zone’s editor Tyler Rogoway’s recalled the incident: “The arrival of the 160th SOAR MH-6 Little Birds was less of a surprise to a few of us in PDX than most. I watched a C-17 unloaded four Little Birds at Portland Air National Guard base and they were flying in less than an hour after being rolled off the jet’s cargo ramp. The helicopters had equipped Navy SEALs hanging off their crew planks and after launching in unison, they flew to downtown Portland at the tail-end of the Friday commute. Once there they zipped down city streets, balanced on their skids 30 stories up on roof ledges while unloading special operators, and kept in continuous motion for hours. People were stunned, and frankly, so was I. It was really was an extreme spectacle to behold. And for a city as ‘colorful’ as Portland, where black helicopter conspiracies aren’t rare, to say the least, many were frightened by what they were seeing. To be honest, that evening mission was about as conspicuous as four helicopters can possibly be. After the sunset, the same four helicopters quickly refueled and launched again, this time flying in very tight formation with just the lead helicopter having its navigational lights on. With the city’s ambient lighting you could still see the silhouettes of four Little Birds zipping over Portland at low altitude. This wasn’t a localized spectacle either, they covered the entire city that night. They flew above my car at a couple hundred feet in two different locales and I wasn’t trying to spot them. It was an incredible sight to behold if you knew what you were looking at. If you didn’t it could have been quite confusing. That night and the next day the local news ran lead stories on the Little Birds’ big air show along with comments fuming mad citizens. The exercise was moved the next night and then appeared to be canceled, or at least moved to a remote area, for the evenings after that. It seems that a similar sequence of events occurred over Denver months earlier and it too stirred-up a similar reaction.” Just in 2012 alone, similar incidents occurred in Miami, Florida and Galveston and Houston, Texas. In the Florida exercise, gunfire echoed through the city streets in addition to the zipping around of black helicopters with armed commandos hanging out of their doors. https://youtube.com/watch?v=9fkRSUWhEZs In 2015, news of a large multi-state training event in the American Southwest, nicknamed Jade Helm , provoked concerns and full-blown conspiracy theories , which were entirely unfounded and without merit. That didn’t stop Texas Governor Greg Abbot from ordering his State Guard militia to monitor the situation , though. Since Part of the problem is that, as a rule, the U.S. military defers to state and local officials to announce these events according to their own policies and regulations. In doing so, this is supposed to make clear that civilians remain in control of the situation at all times. This is also supposed to help keep the training as discreet as possible and prevent undue public attention on the exercises. Unfortunately, as we’ve seen with this newest exercise in New York City, this arrangement doesn’t always work as intended and easily lead to miscommunication. It’s not clear whether or not having the U.S. military announce the exercises themselves or having one or more parties do so ahead of time would necessarily help, but it seems clear that the present method could do with some improvement. Until a more uniformly reliable mechanism for alerting the public comes along, we can expect to see more reports of “black helicopters” flying through cities at the night in the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Sources have told The War Zone that the F-22 belly landing at NAS Fallon on April 13th, 2018 came just days after yet another major incident involving an Alaska-based Raptor. During that event, we were told a Raptor pilot experienced a catastrophic engine failure of one of the jet’s F119 turbofan engines which led to the declaration of an in-flight emergency (IFE). Thankfully pilot recovered the jet safely on one engine. The incident was said to have occurred at another airfield far from Alaska, this time at Tyndall AFB in Florida. The base is the home to F-22 pilot training as well as a major hub of other training activities, including live-fire drills. We reached out to the USAF’s 673rd Air Base Wing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska to verify these claims, and although they were not willing to provide details, they did fully confirm that the incident occurred, stating in an email to The War Zone: “We can confirm that a 3 WG F-22, assigned to the 90th Fighter Squadron, recently experienced an in-flight engine failure while operating out of Tyndall AFB, FL. The aircraft was able to land safely.  hat event is under investigation. The underlying cause of the failure has yet to be determined at this time.” We still don’t know if any major damage resulted from the engine failure, but it’s worth noting that the Raptor’s F119 powerplants cost roughly $10M each. F119 and the F-22’s 2D thrust vectoring nozzles in action., Pratt & Whitney Total engine failures on fighter aircraft do occur, but they are especially rare on late-model types that leverage modern engine technology and materials science. What makes this incident even more interesting is that it occurred within a very close timeframe to the Fallon mishap. It also involved a Raptor from the same fighter wing and occurred while the jet was on temporary duty far away from its home base. Sources state that the Fallon incident was also was caused at least in part by an engine failure, as we noted in our previous post : “Info on the Raptor mishap at Fallon: The slide happened on takeoff. Appears to have been a left engine flameout when the pilot throttled up to take off. By the time he realized the engine was dead, he had already been airborne for a few seconds and raised the gear. The jet bounced for around 1500 feet, and then slide for about 5000 feet. They got it off the ground and on its landing gear last night, so the runway is clear. Chain is wanting it to be quiet still. It’s very fresh obviously. But it’s looking like the second engine failure on Elmo jets in a 7 day period.” F-22 laying on its belly at NAS Fallon. The asymmetric nozzle positions would lend credence to reports that engine failure contributed to the mishap., Air Force amn/nco/snco We will have to wait and see what the investigations into both incidents discover and if the Fallon belly landing was at least partially the result of an engine failure. We will keep you updated as this story continues to develop. Editor’s note: A special thanks to the public affairs shop at Elmendorf AFB. They have been prompt and understanding when it comes to inquiries related to the these less than positive incidents. Absolutely a pro team up there and we really appreciate their assistance.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Now Iraq Has Started Bombing Syria Too (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S., France, the UK, Israel, Turkey, and Russia, in addition to countries that are participating in the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS in eastern Syria, are all bombing the war-torn country. Now, after a week of aerial chaos over Syria that started with a large coordinated cruise missile strike on chemical weapons-related targets, followed by repeated attacks by the Isreali Air Force, and news that Iran is now deploying air defense assets to the country, as well as the possibility that ISIS may be on the rise again there, Iraq has waded into the air combat fray. The office of Iraq’s prime minister issued the following curt statement to mark the country’s opening up of air operations in Syria: “On the orders of the Commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Dr. Haider Abadi, our heroic Air Force on Thursday carried out deadly airstrikes against the sites of the terrorist ISIL gangs in Syria on the Iraqi border.” There is very limited information at this time on exactly what targets were hit and with what aircraft. Iraq has a number of fixed-wing combat aircraft including F-16IQs, T-50s, Su-25s, and armed Cessna Caravans, as well an array of helicopter gunships that could have prosecuted targets in Syria. But what’s most pressing at this time is learning how the strikes were deconflicted with U.S.-led coalition forces , or if they were at all. We will update this post as more information comes available. Update: 5:14am PST— The New York Times reports that the strikes were coordinated with the Assad government and were carried out using F-16s. If indeed the Iraqi government, which has close ties to Iran—and Iran backs Assad directly—did not work with the U.S. on these sorties it could drastically complicate the airspace over eastern Syria and it could lead to a major fracture in U.S.-Iraq military and diplomatic relations. Update: 5:30am PST— Last week prime minister al-Abadi said Iraq would defend itself from militant threats across their own borders. The Iraqi government declared victory over ISIS in December of 2017. We have heard that five targets were struck during the raid. Update: 10:00am PST— The Iraqi Air Force has released video and images of the F-16IQs launching for their strikes in Syria. They show the jets each carrying four GBU-12 500lb laser-guided bombs, a Sniper targeting pod, underwing fuel tanks, and a pair of AIM-9M Sidewinders. Another photo shows the jets in flight with some of their bombs missing. Iraqi Air Force Iraqi Air Force Iraqi Air Force There is also this to ponder: And it looks like the targets were near the town of al Shaddi: It seems the U.S. led coalition had at least something to do with the strikes, or at least it has tacitly agreed with them. Intelligence sharing is possible, but it would be quite focused/limited considering the Assad regime and Russia could also end up obtaining it: Update: 12:40pm PST— The Iraqi Air Force has released this video supposedly showing one of its F-16s obliterating a building being used by ISIS: Editor’s note/correction: Some reports state that the Iraqi Air Force made a similar raid in February of 2017. We have received conflicting information about the accuracy of these reports. But we still removed the sentence stating that this is the first time Iraq has bombed Syria that we know of to err on the safe side of accuracy.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on May 12, 2018",DARPA Will Reel-In Its Gremlins Drones and Pluck Them Out Of The Sky Like Flying Fish,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has chosen defense contractor Dynetics, along with the rest of its team, to proceed to the third phase of its Germlins drone swarm program. In its own announcement, the company revealed that a video we at The War Zone previously reported on actually showed a special docking system that a C-130 Hercules aircraft will tow behind it so that the unmanned aircraft can latch on for a mid-air recovery, not one of the vehicles themselves. The Pentagon quietly slipped news of the contract award, with a total value of more than $32 million, into a daily contracting notice on April 17, 2018. The release says the work, which will include flight tests of the complete system, including the Gremlins drones and the aircraft-mounted launch and recovery systems, should be completed by January 2020. Ground and limited flight tests will begin in 2018, according to a press release Dynetics issued on April 18, 2018. DARPA launched the first phase of the project, which involved four different industry teams, in August 2015 and started the second phase in 2017. While Dynetics is responsible for the overall design of the unmanned vehicles, Williams International is supplying the small turbofan for each one, Moog is building the control actuation systems, and the Sierra Nevada Corporation is designing the drone’s precision navigation system, as well as what the company’s own press release calls “multi-vehicle control services.” It’s worth noting that Williams has a long history of building small, high-efficiency jet engines for cruise missiles, such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile and the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile , as well as various X-planes, including Lockheed Martin’s secretive X-44A . Airborne Systems is also producing a parachute recovery system for the drones. Kratos , one of the previous Gremlins competitors, has now joined Dynetics and will be responsible for putting together complete drones. Applied Systems Engineering, Inc. is building the flight computer that will tie everything together. An earlier artist’s conception of Dynetics’ Gremlins proposal, showing a B-1B bomber and C-130 aircraft at left deploying the drones and additional C-130s at right recovering them in mid-air., Dynetics “The unmanned air vehicles utilized in these future operations will carry a variety of different sensors and other payloads, working together to manage and conduct complex, highly-adaptive operations in contested environments,” Tim Keeter, Dynetics’ Gremlins deputy program manager and chief engineer, said in the company’s press release. “When they complete their mission, they return to airborne manned platforms to be recovered to a forward operating base where they can be quickly refurbished and put back into the fight.  The potential to overwhelm an adversary continuously with multiple volleys is tremendous.” Keeter’s description gets the core of DARPA’s plans for the project. From the very beginning, the goal has been to develop a complete drone swarm system wherein C-130-type aircraft, and maybe even eventually fighter jets and bombers, launch the vehicles at stand-off distance away from enemy defenses. Systima is fabricating the underwing launch pylons to go on the experimental C-130 mothership, along with the launch controller hardware. International Air Response is supplying the aircraft itself. The drones then conduct their missions autonomously or semi-autonomously as a cohesive group before returning to a designated spot where another C-130-type scoops them right out of the sky. Dynetics proposal for getting the unmanned aircraft back on board is to reel them in like fish using a docking apparatus that extends via a tether from the Hercules’ cargo bay. The company says the concept is similar at its most basic level to probe-and-drogue aerial refueling systems. A portion of Dynetics’ new concept art showing its planned method of retrieving the Gremlins drones in mid-air., Dynetics Based on the artwork Dynetics has now released, after linking up with the mothership, the crew retracts the line and a mechanical arm physically grabs the drone and pulls it fully into the aircraft. This is very close to what we at The War Zone posited could have been the case when we discovered a video clip of the prototype system in action. DARPA included that footage in a video montage it put online in 2017, but edited it out of the larger feature sometime afterward. The method is definitely workable, at least in theory. In 2015, Northrop Grumman demonstrated an unmanned combat air vehicle could autonomously link up with a manned tanker using the probe-and-drogue method with its X-47B aircraft. Before that, NASA, in cooperation with DARPA, had thoroughly tested autonomous refueling between drones using a similar system. In 2009, the U.S. Navy also began looking into ways to stabilize the refueling system’s “basket” just to make things simpler for manned aircraft, but it was a development that had obvious applications for unmanned systems, as well. In 2011, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Lab at Western Michigan University demonstrated a subscale prototype system that used four computer-controlled fins – akin to the four grid fins seen on Dynetics’ dock – to help keep the drogue from making overly erratic movements. The video below shows Western Michigan University’s UAV Lab’s concept from 2011. But it’s an arrangement that still might present significant challenges when it comes to retrieving a large number of small drones and doing so rapidly. It seems very likely that the parachute recovery setup that Airborne Systems is providing for each of the Gremlins drones is, at least in part, a failsafe in case they run out of fuel while attempting to dock with the C-130. According to Aviation Week’s Graham Warwick, DARPA wants Dynetics to show it can recover at least four Gremlins within the space of 30 minutes during a demonstration scheduled for late 2019. Otherwise, the program remains focused on the larger overall goal of demonstrating that the small swarm of unmanned aircraft can perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and other “non-kinetic” tasks, such as electronic warfare , all of which makes good sense. Swarms of drones acting together could readily serve as distributed sensor nodes, gathering imagery or other intelligence across a wide area in a relatively short amount of time. Carrying jamming systems or mimicking the signals of larger aircraft, they could also confuse or otherwise disrupt enemy integrated air defenses ahead of a larger operation or just divert their attention away from the path of the real attacking force. But, as Dynetics noted in its own press release, that’s just a small portion of what the Gremlins might eventually be able to do over the battlefield. Depending on how low-observable the final unmanned aircraft design is – and from the available artwork it looks like it could include stealthy design features – it might be able to perform discreet and persistent surveillance in heavily defended denied areas. They might be able to act as loitering munitions , waiting to strike at the most opportune time. In that mode, they could potentially zero in on certain types of emissions to attack radar emitters, air defense nodes, or communications equipment or strike targets after visually matching targets to images stored in an onboard memory database. Different variants might only have to carry one type of equipment, such as navigation systems, sensors, or weapons only, with the entire group sharing route and targeting information and acting as single coorporative strike package . This would allow the underlying drone design to remain relatively small and simple, and therefore reduce costs. DARPA’s own initial Gremlins concept art., DARPA Keeping the price point low is essential for this concept since the drones have to be practical to use in large numbers and potentially with high attrition. DARPA already says each prototype vehicle only needs to keep working for at least 20 individual sorties. “The Phase 1 program showed the feasibility of airborne UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] launch and recovery systems that would require minimal modification to the host aircraft,” Scott Wierzbanowski, DARPA program manager for Gremlins, said in March 2017 . “We’re aiming in Phase 2 to mature two system concepts to enable ‘aircraft carriers in the sky’ using air-recoverable UASs that could carry various payloads – advances that would greatly extend the range, flexibility, and affordability of UAS operations for the U.S. military.” Dynetics seems to have impressed Wierzbanowski and his colleagues enough with its concepts and prototypes to now move on to the next phase. It will be exciting to eventually see a demonstration of the complete system the company and its team are developing.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 10, 2018",Israel Halts Plans For F-15s To Train In Alaska As Iranian Air Defenses Appear In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Israel has dropped plans to send F-15 jet fighters to a major U.S. Air Force exercise in Alaska for the first time. The decision comes amid a burst of Israeli air strikes against Iranian forces and their proxies in Syria , including a recent operation over that country that reportedly destroyed one of Iran’s Russian-made Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile systems. Various Israeli media outlets first reported the change in the composition of Israel’s contingent heading to Red Flag Alaska 18-1 on April 17, 2018. The exercise, which officially begins at Eielson Air Force Base on April 30, 2018, consists of a variety of air-to-air, air-to-ground, and other supporting training activities combined with the added factor of Alaska’s colder climate. Other Israeli Air Force aircraft and personnel, including at least one KC-707 aerial refueling tanker , will still participate in the event. “Israel’s first participation in the Red Flag exercise in Alaska will take place as planned,” a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Haaretz . “According with assessments of the situation the air force has decided to tailor the participation of its planes.” It’s not clear which type of Israeli F-15s were slated to go to Red Flag Alaska. The country still operates a significant number of F-15A/B/C/D types, that it refers to as the Baz , as well as 25 F-15Is , a derivative of the F-15E Strike Eagle, also known as the Ra’am. An Israeli F-15C fighter jet during Exercise Blue Flag 2017., US State Department Israel already regularly participates in the U.S. Air Force’s main Red Flag exercises at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, which also often include participants from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps and other foreign air forces . The Israeli Air Force also now hosts its own similar major multi-national aerial combat training event, called Blue Flag . These exercises give Israeli pilots an opportunity to practice working together with various foreign forces and exchange lessons learned. The ability to operate as part of a large, multi-national coalition is increasingly important and has steadily become the norm for actual military operations. Most recently, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France demonstrated their ability to do just that in a missile strike against Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad’s chemical weapons sites. These events often offer a chance to test aircraft and their various systems, including countermeasures, against representative threats in the air and on the ground. For instance, the U.S. military’s Joint Threat Emitter , or JTE, can mimic a wide array of threatening transmissions associated with various types of air defense systems to heighten the training’s realism. In addition, the U.S. has real foreign anti-aircraft systems it has obtained clandestinely that allied aircraft can train against. But it appears that the demands of very real combat , and more immediate concerns about future conflicts , have prompted Israel to keep its F-15s at home in case there is a need for them. These jets form a particularly important backbone of the Israeli Air Force’s long-range strike, counter-air, networking, and reconnaissance capabilities and the IAF is presently the process of obtaining more . Another Israeli F-15C., IAF These jets have been actively involved in operations over Syria over the past year and a half and the Israeli government recently disclosed that the aircraft took part in a strike that destroyed Assad’s covert nuclear reactor in 2007. One of these planes was reportedly damaged during a counterstrike against Iranian targets in Syria in February 2018, which came in response to Iran sending an armed drone into Israeli territory. While there’s nothing to suggest that this particular incident, or any other battle damage or losses, directly contributed to Israel’s decision against sending the F-15s to Alaska, having the additional aircraft in place does increase their capacity to launch more and larger strikes in the future as necessary. Since April 8, 2018 alone there have been three reported Israeli aerial raids into Syria. Having the additional capacity would allow Israel to ensure it could keep up with its Syrian campaign, as well as remain adequately prepared for other contingencies, such as a potential strike on Iran or an all-out conflict with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. And it is entirely possible that the Israeli operational tempo over Syria could increase, especially as Iran appears to be expanding its own capabilities within Syria to include some of its most capable air defense assets to defend its positions. On April 17, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Israeli missiles destroyed an Iranian Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile system at Tiyas Air Base, or T4, near the Syrian city of Homs earlier in the month. Previously, reports had said that strike focused primarily on destroying Iran’s unmanned aircraft capabilities in the country. A Russian Tor-M1 air defense system., Vitaly Kuzmin Also known as the 9K331, the Russian-built Tor-M1 is a short-range, mobile surface-to-air missile system on a tracked chassis that features its own air search and fire control radars. Iran reportedly received nearly 30 of the vehicles in 2007. Each one can carry up to eight missiles in two four-round vertical launch cells, a design that allows crews to relatively quickly reload after firing. The M1 version appeared in 1991 and reportedly has a number of improvements to resist countermeasures and improve its precision, especially against small targets. This could potentially make it a threat not only to Israeli or other aircraft flying over Syria, but allow it to act as a point defense system to try and shoot down incoming stand-off weapons. Still, despite reports of its advanced nature, the Tor-M1 is an increasingly dated system, which the Russians started replacing nearly a decade ago with the further upgraded variants, such as the M1-2U and M2. But it still reflects an increasingly densely packed air defense environment in Syria, which already includes Syrian government and Russian assets that are officially networked together . The video below shows Russia’s improved Tor-M2 variants, which is visually similar to the -M1 type. The appearance of significant numbers of Iranian Tor-M1s would only further impact Israel’s planning of future strikes and increase the risks to its pilots during those missions. This is undoubtedly why the Israeli Air Force elected to destroy this particular vehicle, which was reportedly not yet in an operational position. It also sends a clear message to Tehran that it’s not even worth airlifting these vehicles to it’s operating locations in Syria. “The next time the Syrians use their air defense systems against our airplanes, we will destroy all of them without thinking twice,” Israel’s firebrand Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman had declared in March 2017. In February 2018, Syria’s air defenders not only targeted Israeli jets, but managed to shoot down an F-16I Sufa multi-role fighter jet. At the same time, it shows a growing willingness on the part of Israel to directly attack Iranian forces in Syria rather than focusing that attention largely on its proxies, such as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah . “It should be clear to President Assad that his reckless efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, his wanton disregard for international law and his provision of a forward base for Iran and its proxies endanger Syria,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a written statement after the U.S.-led missile strikes against the regime’s chemical weapons capabilities on April 14, 2018. If nothing else, Israel’s decision to hold back its F-15s from Red Flag Alaska, ostensibly over operational demands, as well as the appearance of more capable Iranian air defenses in Syria, continue to highlight the complicated and ever-evolving nature of the Syrian conflict and its potential to further spill over into other countries in the region.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Dec 28, 2018",ISIS Is Making A Comeback In Syria As Trump Pushes To Leave And Bring In Arab Forces,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Despite the U.S.-led coalition making significant progress in curtailing the group’s activities , ISIS terrorists are making a comeback in certain parts of Syria, especially in areas under the control of the Syrian regime of Bashar Al Assad. The possibility of an ‘ISIS 2.0’ is a worrying development that comes as President Donald Trump and his administration are looking for ways to extricate U.S. forces from the conflict and replace them with a potentially problematic predominantly Arab coalition consisting of troops from countries including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In a routine press conference on April 17, 2018, U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, the top spokesperson for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, offered new details about the apparent surge in terrorist attacks. On April 16, 2018, The Wall Street Journal had also reported that Trump’s new National Security Advisor John Bolton was in talks with Egyptian, Saudi, Emirati, and Qatari officials about the potential of contributing to a new force that could take over from the approximately 2,000 American troops , as well as other existing coalition personnel and contractors , at some point in the near future. The goal was for those countries to contribute more monetarily to sustain military and civil activities in Syria, as well. “We have seen also not just reports, but also corroborated through our own intelligence gathering, that ISIS is starting to conduct more attacks on the west side of the Euphrates River outside of Abu Kamal against pro-regime forces,” Dillon explained. “And then we’ve also seen – not corroborated by us, but in open source, the retaking of neighborhoods in southern Damascus.” He added intelligence and other reports had begun noticing the rise in ISIS attacks as early as January 2018, which coincides with a Turkish intervention in northwestern Syria targeting Kurdish fighters that led to significant numbers of American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) personnel leaving their positions in order to aid their comrades. This is something we at The War Zone warned could happen right from the beginning of Turkey’s offensive. In March 2018, Dillion acknowledged that the Turkish campaign had caused a slow down in coalition-supported operations against the terrorists. A map of Syria showing Abu Kamal and Deir ez-Zor (Dayr az Zawr), as well as other information., DOD According to Dillon, the remnants of ISIS in eastern Syria are presently concentrated mainly east of the Euphrates closer to the Syria-Iraq border, though the group conducts limited operations as far north as the area around the strategic city of Deir ez-Zor . The river serves as a formal, if dubiously effective deconfliction line between the U.S.-led coalition and Russian forces. It is, by extension, supposed to serve as a boundary between American-backed groups and elements aligned with Assad’s regime, as well. It’s also not entirely clear whether or not there is an ISIS revival underway or if the group, or splinter factions, are transforming into a second iteration of the group, which was itself an outgrowth of Al Qaeda-aligned groups in Iraq and Syria. The iteration of ISIS that managed to seize territory and form a parallel state appeared in no small part due to the vacuum the Syrian civil war created in that country and the rapidly degrading security in Iraq after the United States withdrew the bulk of its forces in 2011. On top of that, there’s the possibility that former ISIS members might seek to form multiple new groups or do so in cooperation with other aggrieved elements in the region. Syria’s Al Qaeda-linked Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham , which is reportedly growing in size and capabilities itself, could easily absorb elements of the organization, which might split off once again in the future. In Iraq, some of the Sunni Muslims terrorists have joined with Kurds to form a group called The White Flag , which stands in opposition to the Shia Mulsim majority government in Baghdad, which also launched a crackdown on Kurdish independent aspirations in 2017. Regardless of its composition, a resurgent or evolving ISIS has translated into a spike in U.S. air and artillery strikes in Syria, as well. Though we don’t know exactly what assets have seen additional use, U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle , F-16C Viper , and F-22 Raptor jet combat aircraft, as well as MQ-9 Reaper drones , flying from various bases in the region, form the bulk of the airpower available to American troops in the country and their partners. In January 2018, the service redeployed a squadron of A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft from Turkey to Afghanistan to support a surge in operations in that country. An F-22 Raptor moves into position to link up with an aerial refueling tanker somewhere over Syria., USAF Air Force special operations AC-130U Spooky and AC-130W Stinger II gunships have also been common features in the region, on and off, as have U.S. Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters operating from forward bases. Earlier in April 2018, B-1B Bones took over operations from B-52s that had been at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Those swing-wing bombers also recently took part in strikes against Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure. On the ground in Syria, Army and Marine Corps personnel have at times manned a combination of towed M777 155mm howitzers and truck-mounted M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS , the latter of which can fire up to six 227mm GPS-guided rockets before having to reload. It’s an impressive array of firepower, which the United States put on full display in February 2018 to beat back a combined force of Kremlin-linked Russian mercenaries and Assad-aligned militiamen near Deir ez-Zor. The video below shows U.S. Army HIMARS in operation at an undisclosed site in Syria. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oTl35tK0ams Data the U.S. Air Force collects and publishes monthly shows that American manned and unmanned aircraft “released” less than 600 bombs and missiles in both Iraq and Syria in December 2017, reflecting a noticeable drop in operations following the liberation of the Syrian city of Raqqa. But in January 2018, this total rose sharply to nearly 800 and remained well above 700 the following month. The American-led coalition, as a general rule, does not track the number of artillery shells and rockets it fires during operations. “We have – in an effort to make sure that we can contain ISIS in these areas [east of the Euphrates], there is [sic] obstacles that were put into place, and we have since focused some of our air assets to be able to identify targets and conduct deliberate planning,” Dillon noted in his April 2018 press briefing. “And now we’re starting to see some more strikes as a result of that.” The colonel didn’t elaborate on what those obstacles are, but they are likely a variety of fortified positions, semi-permanent outposts, and other sites from which American troops and their local Syrian partners can monitor for terrorist movements, call in fire support, and resupply after extended operations. The U.S. military has a number of forward locations it uses throughout eastern Syria. Video footage and images of sites further north, closer to the Turkish border, show special operators , along with conventional supporting troops , with vehicle-mounted and fixed heavy weapons, as well as mortar emplacements , for self-defense and localized patrolling. A map Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency media outlet released showing American forward operating bases in Northern Syria. There are additional sites further south., Anadolu Agency But this robust posture, coupled with the need for American troops to keep up pressure on ISIS as various other actors in Syria pursue their own agendas , is visibly at odds with Trump’s desire for both a quick victory and a rapid exit from the country and its nebulous conflict. Earlier in April 2018, the president caught both the public and his own senior advisers off guard by calling for a withdrawal in the near future. “As far as Syria is concerned, our primary mission in terms of that was getting rid of ISIS,” Trump told reporters during a shared press conference with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania at the White House on April 3, 2018. “We’ve completed that task and we’ll be making a decision very quickly, in coordination with others in the area, as to what we will do.” Unfortunately, as Dillon readily acknowledged in his recent briefing, that mission is far from over and ISIS remains a continuing threat. Pulling American troops out now, and potentially doing so abruptly, would only embolden the terrorists and leave local troops who have been holding the line against the group without critical air, artillery, and materiel support. Members of the US-supported Raqqa Internal Security Force clear improvised explosive devices and other potentially hazardous unexploded ordnance in the city., US Army Even after Assad’s chemical weapons attack in Douma and the subsequent American-led punitive missile strikes on various regime targets, Trump appears to be determined to end the U.S. military’s presence in the country. He has publicly decried the operation as costly and without many directly tangible benefits to the United States, despite his promise both as a candidate and since becoming president to completely defeat ISIS. And this is where Bolton’s plan for an Arab force to help “stabilize” the situation comes in. But from what we’ve already seen, not only could it be difficult to establish this contingent in the first place, deploying it might exacerbate tensions rather than reduce them. Most immediately is the fact that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE remained locked in a bitter spat with Qatar primarily over the latter country’s diplomatic relations with Iran. They’ve largely blockaded the small peninsular nation and it’s highly unlikely that would consent to join together with it in a new coalition. Political tensions between these and other parties have scuttled proposals for an “ Arab NATO ” and similar regional military organizations for years. On top of that, Egypt is already heavily engaged against ISIS-affiliated terrorists in the Sinai Peninsula , along with far less publicized cooperation with Israel over the crisis in the Gaza Strip and support for groups fighting the internationally-recognized government in Libya. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are themselves deeply mired in a grueling counter-insurgency campaign in Yemen against the Houthis , an Iranian-supported rebel movement. US President Donald Trump, left, and National Security Adviser John Bolton. , Oliver Contreras—Sipa USA via AP It could be difficult for any of those countries to find the manpower and other resources to contribute to a broad, effective occupation of eastern Syria for the foreseeable future. And unlike the United States, which has remained laser-focused on containing ISIS, even as it effectively carves out a semi-autonomous region outside of Assad’s control in the process, it’s less clear that these additional parties would be able to suppress their other agendas in Syria. Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have already been actively supporting various rebel groups fighting the regime in Damascus, both as part of efforts managed by the U.S. military and Intelligence Community and on their own . Along with Egypt, they are staunchly opposed to Assad, as well as Iran’s rising influence in Syria and the Middle East as a whole. The matter of Iran is the most important factor in this equation. With the exception of Qatar, the countries the Trump Administration is looking to for help in Syria are all looking to or are actively in the process of trying to contain the regime in Tehran and its proxies. As noted, the Saudi-led fight against the Houthis in Yemen is, at least for that coalition, almost inseparably linked with checking Iranian geopolitical expansion in the Middle East. It is hard to believe that they would be able to fully repress their long-standing goals, especially ejecting Iran from the country and unseating its client Assad, during a Syrian deployment and it is almost certain that they would actively try to target Iranian-backed elements, militarily or otherwise, in the name of “stabilization.” The eagerness of the Saudis to become involved in such a complex and potentially cost effort only seems to underscore the likelihood that they see these and other additional benefits from establishing a U.S.-endorsed foothold in the country. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir., Claudio Peri/ANSA via AP “We are in discussions with the U.S. and have been since the beginning of the Syrian crisis [in 2011] about sending forces into Syria,” Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, said at a press conference in Riyadh on April 17, 2018. “We made a proposal to the Obama administration that if the U.S. were to send forces… then Saudi Arabia would consider along with other countries sending forces as part of this contingent. It’s notable that the Obama administration apparently repeatedly declined this offer for years, quite possibly out of concern for how the deployment might further disrupt the situation in Syria. Trump, however, enjoys a much closer relationship with the Saudis and is far less likely to reject their pledge of support in this matter. But we’ve already seen the problems that conflicting agendas can pose in Syria when Turkey, as already noted, unilaterally invaded northwestern Syria in order to destroy elements of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, also known as the YPG , which it sees as a terrorist group and a direct threat to its interests. Turkish authorities launched that operation despite opposition from their own ally, the United States. Since then, Turkish officials have explicitly threatened American troops over their continued support for the predominantly Kurdish SDF, many of whom came from the ranks of the YPG. The situation also prompted many SDF fighters to turn west, which, in no small part, why ISIS both remains a threat and is now regaining some of its strength. And unless it remains under the umbrella of some sort of American protection, which would largely defeat the Trump Administration’s goal for such a force, the Arab coalition would be much more susceptible to large and open counter-attacks from Assad or his Iranian or Russian benefactors, as well. As it stands now, U.S. troops are the only obstacle in the way of Turkey expanding its campaign against the Kurds throughout northern Syria and preventing Assad from reasserting control straight to the Iraqi border. This is because no one in the country is eager to spark a larger conflict with the United States, a calculus that would not necessarily apply to Saudi, Egyptian, or Emirati forces. Members of the US-supported Raqqa Internal Security Force’s Quick Reaction Force conduct a training exercise., US Army With all this in mind, the United States is perhaps the main actor in Syria concerned about ISIS and is the one most capable of minimizing the group’s ability to conduct activities within the country and elsewhere. It also remains the military most able to provide the air, artillery, and persistent intelligence gathering capabilities, especially when it comes to unmanned aircraft, that have been essential in keeping the terrorists on the run. Until the Syrian geopolitical situation otherwise becomes more stable, a withdrawal of American forces and a decrease in U.S. attention can only realistically provide the terrorists with the room they need to rebuild as other parties distract themselves with their own separate agendas. One simply cannot reliably expect the proposed Arab force simply to fill the gap. Beyond that, there is a distinct risk that doing so would provoke additional tensions and skirmishes that could create a larger conflict that spills over into neighboring countries. Trump may be eager to extricate U.S. forces, and perhaps, more importantly, his administration, from Syria, but it’s no good to do so, though, if American troops have to go right back because the situation has completely collapsed and ISIS has revived itself to the point that it can once again to threaten countries through the region.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 23, 2018",The Next America Class Amphibious Assault Ship Will Almost Be In a Class of its Own,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. USS Bougainville (LHA-8) may share the America class amphibious assault ship designation but it’s really quite a different ship than its two predecessors USS America and USS Tripoli . The biggest change has been widely reported on—the return of a floodable well-deck to ‘gator navy’ flattop production. The decision to omit this feature in exchange for enhanced aviation capabilities was always a very controversial decision and the USMC and the Navy have decided to bring the feature back. But other major changes will also be realized on LHA-8, including a significant reconfiguration of its deck planform and island design. In order to make up some of the aviation related-space lost by adding the well-deck back in, and to better facilitate flight operations and aircraft deck handling, LHA-8’s island superstructure will shrink a bit into a new, more efficient form. Gone is the large structural extension that emanated forward from the island. This feature offered a garage-like space underneath and worked as a mounting platform for some of the ship’s Sea Sparrow , Rolling Airframe Missile, and Phalanx air defense systems . USS Kearsarge tests one of its Phalanx systems. You can see the Rolling Airframe and Sea Sparrow missile turrets and their various blast shields mounted in the background behind the Phalanx., USN This structure dates back to the Tarawa class in one form or another, but its deletion, along with an added sponson that extends out from the deck, will allow for expanded parking in front of the island. As for the part of the ship’s defensive weapons suite that once sat atop that structure, they are relocated atop the island itself. The reconfiguration allows for at least three additional parking spots for full-sized aircraft, features no ‘locked’ spots where one aircraft has to be moved to get to another, and it allows for an MV-22 to be serviced without it blocking flight operations. Youtube Screencap Other modifications to LHA-8 that aren’t externally apparent are changes to roughly 40% of the ship’s 2,400 compartments. This includes relocating, adding, or eliminating existing ones. For instance, the entire hospital area has been relocated and the hangar bay’s forward area has had its ceiling dropped. The ship will also be the first amphibious flattop to field the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR), which is being integrated on the Navy’s new supercarriers after USS Gerald R. Ford , giving the ship a massive leap in surveillance capability. The Tarawa and later the Wasp class, of which USS Kearsarge (LHD-3) is a part of (seen above), featured well decks that many types of craft could access including Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft. The America class deleted this feature in exchange for enhanced aviation capabilities. With USS Bougainville this is set to change., USN Navyrecognition.com has good comparison metrics that highlight the differences between the last ship in the Wasp class, the first two America class ships, and the revised America class in the form of USS Bougainville LHA-8, which is also being referred to as America class Flight I: Comparative specifications between LHD-8 | LHA-7 | LHA-8 Length overall (ft) – 844 | 844 | 844 Beam – 106 |106 | 106 Full load displacement – 41,772 | 43,745 | 43,329 Aviation Support (ft²) – 31,559 | 47,284 | 38,049 Cargo fuel, JP-5 (gal) – 585,000 | 1,330,000 | 585,000 Well Deck LCAC Capacity – 3 | 0 | 2 Hangar area (ft²) – 18,745 | 28,142 | 28,142 Vehicle stowage area (ft²) – 28,645 | 18,911 | 16,011 As you can see, the ship lost about 9,000 square feet of aviation support space due to adding the well-deck back in, but biggest of all is the change in available jet fuel, from 1,330,000 gallons back to 585,000 gallons found on the Wasp class. That’s a huge change, but LHA-8 can still fill up an F-35B nearly 300 times with its available jet fuel storage. Vehicle stowage area has taken a hit compared to the Wasp class and the original America class designs, going from 28,645 square feet on the Wasp class LHD-8 to 18,911 on the last two America class ships, down to just 16,011 on LHA-8. You can see just how much more space the reconfiguration of the America class’ deck and island superstructure offers., USN Here are some of the major changes to the LHA-8’s internal layout., USN Still, all around LHA-8 seems to be a good compromise between sea and air amphibious assault capabilities and sacrifices more in sustainment of air operations without consistent resupply than it does in moment-to-moment aircraft operations capacity. The America class is being looked on to be able to provide a “Lightning Carrier” capability in which the ship’s air wing is made up almost entirely of F-35Bs. LHA-8 and its follow-on ships should still be able to do that and benefit from a well-deck capable of embarking two LCACs at the same, although with more replenishment support than LHA-6 and LHA-7. This is a great video showing the model of LHA-8 and some of its major changes compared to the USS America and USS Tripoli. Fast forward to roughly 3:18: USS America has just made its first operational deployment and USS Tripoli was just christened last September. With this in mind, the class still has a lot to prove, especially considering it has been mired in the well-deck and F-35 controversies , the latter of which resulted in multiple reworks orders. But these vessels could factor into the ongoing debate over building cheaper, smaller carriers for Navy fighter aircraft, instead of solely building ultra-expensive nuclear supercarriers. USN The Navy has already signed a $3B contract with Huntington Ingalls Industries to design and build USS Bougainville, with the ship slated to begin construction in late 2018. The finished amphibious flattop is then scheduled to be delivered in early 2024.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 10, 2018",Conflicting Claims Swirl As Israel Continues Air War Against Iranian Interests In Syria,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Syrian government and its partners have issued a string of contradictory reports regarding yet another reported Israeli strike against Iranian interests in the country. Though the exact details of the event remain unclear, Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad and his Russian benefactors seem eager to dismiss the incident, in part or in full, while still declaring some sort of victory in the aftermath a massive U.S.-led missile barrage against various chemical weapons sites in the country. On the night of April 16-17, 2018, Syria’s state media outlet SANA and sources from the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reported that there had been missile strikes against Shayrat air base near the city of Homs and another military airfield, Al Dumair, outside the capital Damascus. SANA then declared that Syrian air defenders had shot down a number of missiles, before retracting that story and stating that the entire incident had actually been a false alarm . The latest claim is that this was all the result of a combined U.S.-Israeli electronic or cyber warfare attack. “We don’t comment on such reports,” a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told various Israeli media outlets. As a general rule, it is Israeli government policy not to acknowledge these operations, at least initially. For its part, the Pentagon said that it was in no way involved in any strikes near Damascus or Homs at that time. That being said, satellite imagery showing Iranian-occupied facilities in Syria subsequently emerged from Israeli media outlets . The message here seemed to be an unambiguous public statement that Israel knows where Iran’s forces in the country are and is more than willing to strike at them if need be. And though we don’t know whether or not the United States was actually involved, either an Israeli physical or non-kinetic attack would be very plausible. Israel has made it no secret that it sees Iran’s growing influence and physical infrastructure in Syria as an unacceptable threat and has launched a number of strikes against Iranian and Hezbollah-related targets in the country since the civil war began in 2011. This campaign has notably expanded since January 2017 and shows no signs of slowing down. On April 8, 2017, within 24 hours of the now infamous Syrian government chemical weapons attack in Douma , Israeli warplanes fired missiles at Tiyas Air Base near Homs, also known as T4. Iran said that this operation killed seven members of the quasi-military Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force, which is responsible for advising and assisting for military forces and non-state militant groups abroad. One of the hangars at the T4 air base in Syria after the Israeli strike on April 8, 2018., Far News Agency “Tel Aviv will be punished for its aggressive action,” Bahram Ghassemi, the spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters on April 16, 2017 in regards to the strike on T4. “The  occupying Zionist regime will, sooner or later, receive an appropriate  response to its actions.” Rather than a response to the Douma attack, that strike appeared to be focused on destroying Iran’s unmanned aircraft capabilities within Syria. Among the IRGC’s dead was reportedly head of their drone operations in the country. The mission followed directly from an incident in which Iran sent a drone into Israel from Syria in February 2018, which touched off a major series of events, including Syrian air defenders shooting down an Israeli F-16I Sufa multi-role combat aircraft. Earlier in April 2018, Israeli officials announced that the unmanned aircraft was armed and appeared to be on its way to conduct its own strike . Imagery Israeli officials released of T4 in February 2018, which appears to show an Iranian Shahed 129 drone. The United States shot down two of these over Syria in 2017., IDF Then, on April 14, 2018, within 24 hours of the American-led missile strikes, Israel reportedly launched another raid into Syria, this time against a Hezbollah garrison near the city of Aleppo. Again, it was not clear if there was any direct connection or coordination between the U.S. military effort and the subsequent Israeli one. “Early this morning, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom demonstrated that their commitment is not limited to proclamations of principle,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a written statement after the U.S.-led operation. But he also took the opportunity to tell Assad that “his provision of a forward base for Iran and its proxies endangers Syria.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu holds a piece of the Iranian drone that Israeli forces shot down during a press conference in February 2018., AP So, in that vein, Israel could have decided to simply launch an attack run to further demonstrate its abilities to penetrate into Syrian airspace and attack targets at will. This would have provided a very visible counterpoint to the February shoot down and in light of dubious Russian-supported claims from Syria’s military about having shot down the majority of the missiles in both Israel’s April 8 strike. “The Syrian response was remarkably ineffective in all domains,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, Director of the Joint Staff, said during a press conference on April 14, 2018 in regards to the American, British, and French missile strikes.. He declined to say whether or not the United States or its allies actually employed any electronic or cyber warfare capabilities themselves. Russia has since similarly said Syrian forces managed to largely brush aside those missiles with their air defense network. That Syria claimed to have shot down a number of missiles in this latest instance before changing its story to say that there were no incoming threats at all can only cast more doubt on these previous narratives. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov details outrageous claims about the success Syrian air defense forces had in defeating an American-led missile barrage during a press conference on April 16, 2018., Vadim Savitskii / Sputnik via AP But an electronic or cyber warfare attack, or some combination thereof, would hardly be out of the realm of reason. In 2007, the IDF reportedly launched a cyber warfare attack using a computer program called Suter to misdirect Syrian air defense radars and clear the way for a strike on the country’s covert nuclear reactor in Deir ez-Zor. Though Israel has finally declassified the existence of that operation, it still has not publicly confirmed whether or not it employed any electronic or cyber warfare capabilities. At the same time, it is difficult to imagine the Israelis going through all of that effort without it being in support of additional objectives. If it is true that they didn’t actually launch a strike, these electronic or cyber disruptions might have been in support of an intelligence or reconnaissance mission or a field test of a new countermeasures system . Whatever the case, there seems to be some debate among Assad and his Russian and Iranian benefactors about how best to respond to the last Israeli incursion, especially in light of the very public American-led strike. Though Israel’s focus is clearly still on Iran and Hezbollah, when it comes to the situation in Syria, it is inherently difficult for one party to engage another in isolation. At the same time, successful Israeli raids, whatever they target, only serve to potentially embarrass Russia, which has officially linked its own air defenses in the country with Assad’s and is the primary supplier of surface-to-air missile systems to the Syrian government. It is therefore increasingly difficult for the Kremlin to sit by idly ignoring these strikes, even though its forces and interests are not directly under threat. The official Syrian government video below shows the country’s advanced Russian-supplied Buk-M2E tracked and Pantsir-S1 wheeled air defense systems. https://youtube.com/watch?v=7Yq5oqzbAw0 This, in turn, raises the specter of increasing tensions between Israel and Russia and the possibility that Russian officials could become increasingly critical of both Israeli and American activities in Syria and craft a narrative of there being a firmer link between their individual campaigns. The Kremlin is staunchly opposed to the U.S. military’s presence in Syria, which it routinely decries as an illegal occupation . Iran and Hezbollah are already increasingly employing this narrative of a shared U.S.-Israeli campaign against Assad. “The conditions do not point to a total war … unless Trump and Netanyahu completely lose their minds,” deputy Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Qassem said in a print interview published on April 13, 2018, ahead of the American-led strikes in Syria, clearly linking American and Israeli actions together whether this is accurate or not. “By bombing the T-4 army base [on April 8], Israel wanted to create an equation that shows that it controls the rules of conflict, and this is not acceptable to us,” he said in a subsequent television interview on April 16, 2018. Israel itself may be increasingly dissatisfied with the U.S. government often contradictory Syria policy, which is, at present, officially to stay out of the country’s civil war and not actively attempt to unseat Assad. There are now reports that the United States is, once again , seeking to craft a coalition of foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and the United Arab Emirates , so it can completely withdraw its own forces. Unnamed Israeli officials have also cast doubts as to the utility of the recent U.S.-led strikes against Assad’s chemical weapons capabilities, according to a report by Israel’s Ynet News . “The statement of ‘Mission Accomplished’ and [the assertion] that Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons has been fatally hit has no basis,” the outlet quoted one anonymous intelligence official as saying. US President Donald Trump, at right, points to pictures of various weapons and other military equipment the United States has approved for sale to Saudi Arabia during a meeting with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, at left., Kevin Dietsch/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP The U.S.-led strike may have emboldened Israel to act, but it’s also true that they were already doing so shortly beforehand. It does seem that they were more than happy to take advantage of the immediate aftermath of the missile barrage to launch their own operation and have continued to exploit the apparent weakness of Syria’s air defense network. The danger in Syria is always that the myriad different parties and their agendas will become so entangled as to lead, at a certain point uncontrollably, to a larger conflagration inside the country or throughout the region more broadly. It seems clear that Israel has long felt it has had some political leeway to intervene in Syria without the danger of such significant repercussions. However, Israeli officials also clearly see countering Iran’s expanding posture in the country as an existential issue that they would pursue regardless. With Syria’s geopolitical landscape once again especially fluid, it’s difficult to necessarily see how things might play out, even in the near term. For the moment, by describing the latest Israeli strike as a non-kinetic affair, Syrian authorities have been able to claim that their military facilities suffered no damage while also criticizing the operation. Whether or not Israel is inclined to let that narrative stand, and if not whether it decides to further escalate its air campaign, remains to be seen.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 14, 2018",Four Outlandish Russian Ministry of Defense Claims About The Syrian Missile Raid,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that the Russian government has turned disinformation into an art form , to the point that they don’t even necessarily need to create believable narratives to raise doubts and effectively muddy the waters regarding major international events. True to form, the Kremlin has now made a host of outrageous claims about recent U.S., U.K., and French strikes on chemical weapons sites in Syria to try and bolster the Syrian regime’s own assertions that it was able to defeat the majority of the incoming missiles. Top Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov provided this latest dubious counter-narrative, without providing any supporting evidence, during a press conference at the ministry in Moscow on April 16, 2018. His remarks dispute almost every detail the United States and its allies have provide about the operation, right down to the total number of targets American, British, and French aircraft and ships struck and how many missiles they employed altogether. You can read his entire statement in English on the Russian Defense Ministry website, but here are four of the officer’s assertions that are hardest to believe. According to the U.S. military, American, British, and French forces fired 105 cruise missiles of various types against three groups of targets in Syria. In addition, the Syrian air defenses fired 40 surface-to-air missiles, mostly after the strike was over, and there was no immediate indication that they shot anything down in the process. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov gives his briefing on April 16, 2018., Vadim Savitskii / Sputnik  via AP The United States and its partners didn’t hit Barzah with 76 missiles Konashenkov’s first point was to question why the United States and its allies fired 76 missiles – 57 Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles (TLAM) and 19 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range ( JASSM-ER ) air-launched cruise missiles – at the Barzah Research Center near Syria’s capital Damascus. But the major general insists that this apparent overkill is actually an attempt to hide the true scope of the operation. “The fact is that all Syrian objects [at Barzah] declared as targets are not subsurface ones or well protected by the echeloned air defense system of bunkers,” he said. “Therefore, it was enough not more than 10 missiles for each of the three targets in order to destroy them by any calculation methods, taking into account the triple overlap for their guaranteed destruction.” It’s definitely worth asking why it was necessary to employ nearly 80 missiles, each costing many hundreds of thousands of dollars, against two above-ground research facilities and an associated parking structure. But there’s nothing to suggest the U.S. military’s report is necessarily impossible or implausible. We know that the mission planning took into account that there were likely chemical weapons or precursor chemical stockpiles at Barzah, which could have posed a danger to innocent bystanders in the surrounding area, as it has done when striking similar targets in the past. The research center is situated in a more densely populated area than the other two targets the U.S. military and its allies struck and it is possible that the number of missiles employed reflected a deliberate attempt to make sure any agents were completely vaporized in the process. The video below shows a U.S. air strike on an ISIS chemical weapons production facility in Mosul, Iraq in 2016. More likely, especially based on what we also know from the Pentagon’s subsequent briefing , this large number of missiles was, at least in part, dictated by a need for it to be larger overall operation than the one against Syria’s Shayrat Air Base in 2017 . The ostensible goal was to send a message that this operation was more significant than the last one, which involved 59 Tomahawks, one of which failed to reach its target. It was also important to ensure that the site was completely obliterated to avoid the same kind of criticisms that followed the strike on Shayrat, after which the Syrians quickly put the base back into operation calling into question the utility of the operation in the first place . “You can look at the map – you can particularly at the Barzeh site and make your own conclusions,” U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, the Director of the Joint Staff, said on April 14, 2018 . “I would say they had three buildings there and a parking deck, and now they don’t. “ It’s also worth noting that Konashenkov does not appear to use the Pentagon’s own stated figures about the strike, suggesting that the American, British, and French missiles were equally distributed among the three targets. The U.S. military’s statement that the French were solely responsible for the last target, the Him Shinshar bunker complex, and only employed seven SCALP air-launched cruise missiles , definitely doesn’t fit with his overarching narrative of overkill across the board. The video below shows French aircraft during the strikes on Syria on April 14, 2018. The operation attempted to destroy 10 targets, not three This basic assertion is essential to the Russian officer’s next major claim, which is that the United States and its allies actually attacked 10 different targets in Syria, not three. According to Konashenkov, in addition to the Barzah site and the two distinct target sets at Him Shinshar, missiles flew toward Damascus International Airport and Syrian air bases at Al Dumayr, Blai, Shayrat, Tiyas, Mazzeh, and Homs. It’s unclear what facility he was talking about with regards to Homs, since the governorate as a whole is home to the Shayrat, Tiyas, and Al Qusayr air bases. Conveniently, the Russian military officer said that Syrian air defenses were able to shoot down all but five targeting Mazzeh and three that hit Homs. Miraculously, none of those weapons were able to cause any significant damage, either. So there could be no evidence to prove or disprove these claims beyond the U.S. military’s own statements otherwise. But there is absolutely no indication that any of these sites were intended targets. Air defenders at Mazzeh, which is situated less than 10 miles from downtown Damascus, did reportedly fire surface-to-air missiles, but it’s not when those launches occurred and there’s no indication that the base – which Konashenkov also claimed was unoccupied at the time – was ever in any danger itself. On top of that, depending on what the actual target the major general was referring to in Homs, it is possible that any damage might have been from a previous strike. On April 8, 2016, Israel reportedly launched a separate strike on Tiyas, also known as T4, in the governorate. The Syrians shot down more than 70 missiles With so many targets apparently unscathed, Konashenkov reiterated the Syrian government’s claim that its forces had been able to shoot down 71 missiles. He also repeated the regime’s position that there were only 103 rather than 105 missiles to begin with. Again, if this is true, it means Syrian air defense forces had a better than 67 percent kill ratio against the incoming missiles – and a 100 percent kill ratio in defense of five specific targets – except when it came to the three locations the U.S. military and its allies say they actually struck. This is on par with Russia’s equally questionable insistence that only 23 of the 59 missiles the United States launched at Shayrat in 2017 made it through to hit that base. “It is to be stressed that [the] Syrian air defense system was organized on the principle of object defense,” Konashenkov said. “Almost all objects protected by air defense systems repelled the strike.” Though it is likely that the Syrians don’t have enough point air defense systems to adequately defend every one of their vital military installations against a large cruise missile attack, the massive discrepancy in the effectiveness of the response makes this claim questionable. It seems difficult to believe that Syria’s military could completely prevent attacks on five of 10 supposed targets, effectively neutralize the impact on two more, but let 80 percent of the missiles hit their mark at Barzah and Him Sinshar. “We also note that we’ve successfully destroyed three buildings in metropolitan Damascus” in the Barzah strike, Lieutenant General McKenzie, the Director of the Joint Staff, added. “[This is] one of the most heavily defended airspace areas in the world.” In addition, despite supposedly shooting down dozens of incoming cruise missiles, there has so far been no significant photographic evidence of the resulting debris one might associate with such a high volume of shoot downs. There is one unconfirmed photograph of what appears to be part of a U.K. Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missile somewhere near Homs, but it’s unclear if that was just the debris leftover from a successful impact. Other images making the rounds on social media actually show part of an SS-21 Tochka short-range ballistic missile, a pair of damaged R-40 air-to-air missiles , and tail sections from 2K12E Kvadrat surface-to-air missiles, also known as the SA-6 Gainful. Missiles and guided bombs often leave behind evidence during perfectly normal functioning and yet there is little evidence of even that so far. Nearly 65 percent of Syrian surface-to-air missiles hit something Shooting down missiles, especially low-flying cruise missiles, with other missiles isn’t easy to do under the best of circumstances. And while the Syrian air defense network has shown itself to be a semi-credible threat, including to advanced air forces such as that of Israel , it has been of minimal effectiveness against hostile, non-stealthy jets flying deep into the country to conduct strikes. Now, the Syrians, and by extension, the Russians, are claiming that these same air defenders managed to shoot down nearly two-thirds of all the incoming missiles using seven different short-to-medium range surface-to-air missile systems. According to Konashenkov, Syria’s military also fired 112 surface-to-air missiles, nearly three times more than the Pentagon reported. Among those, the command- and infrared guided Pantsir-S1 and 9K35 Strela-10 – also known as the SA-13 Gopher – were reportedly among the most effective with 96 and 60 percent hit rates respectively. The radar-guided Buk and the similar, but older 2K12E Kvadrat, were supposedly the other two top performers, taking down more than 80 and 50 percent of their intended targets respectively. The claims about the Pantsir-S1 and Buk systems and their effectiveness seem almost too impressive to be believed, again especially since there is so little visual evidence to back it up. In addition, the S-200 was 100 percent ineffective in this instance. Also known as the SA-5 Gammon, this is the only Syrian air defense system to have scored a confirmed kill of any kind in the past 18 months, shooting down an Israeli F-16I Sufa multi-role combat jet in February 2018. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system., Vitaly Kuzmin “It is to be added that no one should be misled by low results made by S-200 air defense missile systems,” Konashenkov said. “This system is primarily designed to hit aircraft. However, this system shot down a fighter of a neighboring country.” But the same goes for every other system he listed, not one of which is primarily an anti-missile defense weapon. The Russians do claim many of the systems Syria has in its arsenal have secondary uses against cruise missiles and other small targets, but there is virtually no confirmed, real-world data about their effectiveness in that role. And if the Kremlin and the Syrians are to be believed, the Buk, in particular, performed better than even the manufacturer Almaz-Antey’s expectations , which says it should be able to hit cruise missiles between 70 and 80 percent of the time. This marketing figure almost certainly reflects employing the system under the most optimal conditions, if it is entirely accurate at all. Responding to multi-directional, short-notice cruise missile barrage in the dead of night is hardly the best case scenario for any air defense network. This also seems to ignore the advanced capabilities of both JASSM-ER and Storm Shadow/SCALP, which have low-observable designs and other features to improve their survivability. The non-stealthy, but low-flying, terrain-following TLAM also has decades of proven capability against similar integrated air defense networks. All of this would have reduced the time air defenders would have had to detect and engage the incoming weapons at all. The stealth features on nearly 40 of the incoming missiles would have made it difficult even for point defense systems to track and target them in the short window available, as well. The transporter erector launcher and radar (TELAR) portion of the Buk-M2 air defense system., Vitaly Kuzmin The ‘real situation’ “Now, there is a real situation,” Konashenkov stressed in offering his counterpoint to the U.S. military’s own reports, as well as the corroborating statements from British and French allies. To believe him, though, one has to accept that the United States government is explicitly lying about almost every detail of the strikes. The major general’s claims rely entirely on the idea that not only did the U.S., U.K., and French forces attempt to destroy more than three times as many targets, they effectively did no damage to any of those other sites. Then Syrian air defenders managed to knock out dozens of incoming missiles, but so far have not been able to recover any trophies from firmly regime-controlled areas to display of this massive victory. Beyond that, every single one of their air defense systems performed extremely well with the sole exception of the one system it has conclusively demonstrated it is capable of employing effectively, the SA-5. Perhaps most important, those weapons were able to work with a high degree of success against some of the most advanced and proven cruise missiles in production today. The alternative is to believe the Pentagon’s official report, that it, along with its allies, launched strikes against three distinct targets and destroyed them all, which would remain true even if it does turn out that some of the missiles got shot down or otherwise failed to reach their destinations in the end. The U.S. military has not said conclusively that all of its weapons functioned properly. If nothing else, it is worth noting that neither the Syrians nor the Russians deny that American, British, and French missiles successfully leveled Barzah and the facilities at Him Shinshar, which is perhaps the only point the two sides agree on.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Here’s The Navy’s Vision For A New Cruiser To Replace The Aging Ticonderoga Class,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s Ticonderoga class cruisers are in the back half of their operational careers yet the seagoing service has struggled to produce an actionable strategy to replace their unique capabilities. The ‘Ticos’ lives may be able to be extended a number of years , but a replacement will be needed and it will take years to move such an initiative from thought to form. Now, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral John Richardson, has put forward his vision and strategy to field such a vessel and it’s bound to be a controversial one. In an interview with Defense News’ David Larter, the CNO explained that he wanted to model the next generation cruiser project on the FFG(X) frigate program that is currently underway. That program, which is as much a referendum on the stumbling Littoral Combat Ship as anything else, aims to procure an existing, mature hull design and modify it with the Navy’s preferred sensors, combat system, and weaponry. The down-select of five competitors occurred just two months ago and the contract will be awarded to the winner in 2019. The first frigates are slated to come online in 2025, making the program quite aggressive in terms traditional naval procurement. The Ticonderoga class has been plowing the seas since 1983, and its hull design was borrowed even back then. The Navy has put off a replacement for as long as it can., USN The difference between FFG(X) and the new cruiser initiative is that there are few existing large-hull surface combatant designs available to chose from. The Flight III Arleigh Burke has already maxed-out the class’s hull and power generation capacity , so that’s not an option. There really isn’t anything from an allied country that could work without massive modifications either. Arleigh Burke Flight III configuration., USN/GAO This leaves the DDG-1000 Zumwalt class’s exotic hull form and the LPD-17 San Antonio class design which has already been pitched for use as a missile defense picket ship, as well as a slew of other configurations. LPD-17 is also the basis for the upcoming LX(R) replacement for Harpers Ferry and Whidbey Island class amphibious landing dock ships. Huntington Ingalls The problem is that the San Antonio class ships are huge with broad hulls and displace roughly 25,000 tons. For comparison, the Ticonderoga class is shy of displacing 10,000 tons. Most notably, these ships cannot keep up with a carrier strike group, lacking a third of the speed to do so. In addition to being an existing hull design, the vessels also have to possess the ability to produce large amounts of power. Richardson told Larter: “Power plant and power generation, you need to really pay attention to that because its very hard to change after you buy it… And if you think about the kinds of combat systems and weapons systems we’re going to have on future ships, they have got to be able to generate pulsed power and those sorts of things… So, lots of power. Buy as much power as you can afford because it’s like RAM on your computer, you’re going to need more as soon as you buy it.” The CNO is clearly thinking of lasers, railguns, electronic warfare systems, and very powerful radars and other sensors here, and he is right to do so. The Zumwalt class, in particular, has the most capable power generation system of any U.S. Navy surface combatant, but the San Antonio class, with all of its room, could be modified to handle any of the Navy’s future power needs as well. Zumwalt arriving in San Diego., USN The third requirement Richardson puts on the future cruiser program will be its most controversial—modularity. His idea, which he has vaguely alluded to before , involves building the cruiser with a number of critical hardwired systems, like those pertaining to navigation, propulsion, and sustainment of the ship’s compliment. But others, including sensors and weapons launchers, could be swapped out with much greater ease than they are today. Richard proclaimed: “Everything else, though, is swappable, and that has to be designed into the DNA of the ship so you can come in on a short upkeep and swap out your radar system, or your combat system, or put this weapons system in… It has a lot to do with designing standards so that everybody can build to those standards so it’s a much more dynamic, swappable type of a thing… We’ll get this design done. And because some things will be permanent and some things will be swappable, let’s just get that thing out there. It will be 100 percent better than the current cruiser… And then [when] we get smarter, we’ll put the next iteration out there.”” That may sound great at first glance, but the truth is the Navy has an absolutely miserable track record when it comes to a much less ambitious but similar program in which modularity was supposedly a key selling point—the Littoral Combat Ship . That program originally saw various mission modules that could be swapped-out pier-side in a number of hours before the ship was sent back out to see. Fast forward a decade and the mission module concept has largely failed not just in terms of ease of swapability, but also in terms their effectiveness and deployability . Keep in mind that this concept wasn’t nearly as far-reaching as the one Richardson is proposing here, in which even the ship’s combat system and its primary sensor arrays would be exchanged cost-effectively in just a short maintenance period. These videos are really a hoot, talk about science fiction, it’s all going to be so easy!: Other Naval arms have approached modularity in a far simpler way, providing for the capacity to swap containerized weapons that include self-contained command and control systems into their hulls. But what Richardson is talking about here is rapidly swapping out key components that are traditionally deeply integrated into a surface combatant’s design and construction. It seems as if this cruiser, or ‘large surface combatant’ initiative would not only replace the Ticonderoga class, but it would also replace at least a portion of the Arleigh Burke class destroyers as well, the first of which were commissioned in 1991. DDG-1001 undergoing sea trials off Maine. , USN It really seems as if the DDG-1000 Zumwalt class design may have an opportunity to make a comeback of sorts here. It already has the power generation that Richardson is looking for and the open-architecture network technology that could work as a base for a more modular approach to future combat systems. Above all else, its unique command center, known as the Ship’s Mission Center , acts like a floating combined operations center of sorts and has all the room required for high-level command areas. This feature alone could prove to be invaluable for directing future anti-air warfare operations. Make sure to read all about the Zumwalt’s capabilities, and its massive deficiencies, in this past War Zone special feature . The Zumwalt class features a unique battle management center that is unlike the dark and cramped combat information centers of the past. This would be especially useful on a future cruiser as the Ticonderoga class has areas for flag officers and greater command and control capabilities than its destroyer stablemates. Still, no actual photos have been released of this area located deep within Zumwalt and her sister ships. , Public Domain With the removal of the ship’s twin Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), which currently have no purpose anyway due to a total lack of ammunition, maybe an area for a modular weapons bay could be fitted as well as additional vertical launch cells to at least meet the number found on the Ticonderoga class, which is 122 cells. Currently, the Zumwalt class vessels have 80 Mk57 vertical launch tubes arrayed around the ship’s periphery. Some modularity could be designed into a new version of the ship’s deckhouse as well, with extra apertures and cooling available for future systems to be installed. The hangar bay and flight deck is large on these vessels. So some of that room could also be turned over to an area for a weapons module or two. But Zumwalt’s tumblehome hull design could remain an issue. Cruisers have to accompany the aircraft carriers under their protection anywhere they travel, and sometimes that includes transits through very rough seas . Maybe it could be redesigned to include a traditional bow if the low-observable requirements placed on the DDG-1000 design were largely dropped or at least relaxed. The truth is that the Navy has already greatly watered down the ship’s stealthy signature anyways due to a long string of laughably short-sighted cost-cutting decisions. Considering cruisers often work as air warfare battle management nerve centers alongside the aircraft carriers they protect, low observability shouldn’t be a high priority. The Navy continues to degrade the Zumwalt’s low radar signature via bolting on systems in order to save money. With just three ships in inventory, and unusable deck guns among many other watered down capabilities, these vessels will be lucky to remain operational in the coming decade: pic.twitter.com/AFC3yzm0iK — 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) March 27, 2018 Still, that’s one big list of modifications, and the Navy will have to study just how feasible doing so would be. But the service could also go another direction and just field a Zumwalt class follow-on in the cruiser role with minimal modifications, making tweaks to the deckhouse, network, and combat system for future modularity and removing its guns in exchange for more VLS cells and room for future expansion. This would be similar to the long-canceled CG(X) that originally gave birth to the Zumwalt’s current configuration. From 2000-2007 there were multiple iterations of the next generation cruiser concept, of which the Zumwalt class was partially based. CGX seems like a relatively straightforward adaptation of the Zumwalt class., Globalsecurity.org Doing so would be more economical than an extensive redesign and it would help the existing but tiny fleet of three Zumwalt class destroyers survive what is going to be a very costly future sustainment initiative in order to keep them viable. By buying in bulk, with Zumwalt and her two sister ships having rung out the bugs in the design, would also drastically lower unit costs. As the Zumwalt program shrunk ever smaller, unit cost skyrocketed. It was the classic Pentagon death spiral, but by some estimates, if those ships were brought in numbers, their cost would have been slashed dramatically and would have been competitive with the Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyers that were controversially chosen over the production of more Zumwalt class ships. USN We will have to see if the CNO’s plans for a ship that is supposedly so easily transformable but also based on an existing design come to pass. But hopefully, the Navy can blend some of those ideas with the Zumwalt class that the service has already paid over $10B to develop. Otherwise, the Navy would have to start from scratch, which would be hugely expensive and considering the last decade or so when it comes to the service’s procurement track record of developing and fielding ships with modular capabilities, it could end up being a mess that never really delivers what was promised.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 5, 2018",The Navy Eyes Replacing Its Hospital Ships With A Fleet of Smaller Medical Vessels,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the U.S. Navy considers retiring one or both of its purpose-built hospital ships , it has established a formal team to examine whether a larger number of smaller ships could provide a viable alternative in at least some situations. A number of proposals already exist, including a conversion or purpose-built medical derivative of the San Antonio -class amphibious ship, a similar variant of Spearhead -class Expeditionary Fast Transport, and a modular hospital package for the service’s new giant Expeditionary Sea Bases . U.S. Navy Vice Admiral William Merz publicly disclosed the existence of the so-called Requirement Evaluation Team, or RET, at a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee on April 13, 2018. It first emerged the month before that at least one of the service’s two dedicated hospital ships – USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort – could end up in mothballs by the end of 2019, which quickly drew the ire of lawmakers who cited those ships’ value for both combat and humanitarian missions. “The problem with those [hospital] ships is, there’s only two of them, and they’re big, and we’re moving to a more distributed maritime operations construct,” Merz explained at the April 2018 hearing. “There’s no lack of commitment [to this medical capability]; matter of fact, we’re taking a broader look at the capabilities on whether or not they are aligned with the way we plan to fight our future battles. So you’re going to see that requirement surface probably this year, and then we’ll start the process on how we’re going to fill that requirement.” Although the Navy is still crafting these requirements for a future afloat medical force, the ship-building industry appears to have already gotten the message that there could be demand for new and novel hospital ship concepts. So far, the potential designs are all based on existing hullforms. USNS Mercy , one of the US Navy’s two dedicated hospital ships at present., MCs Clay M. Whaley Huntington Ingalls has suggested its future Flight II San Antonio -class landing platform docks, or derivatives using a single hull shape, could fill the hospital ship role. At present, the Navy is already planning to buy more than a dozen of these ships, which it had previously referred to as LX(R) , and could potentially decide to convert one or more to a hospital ship configuration. The Newport News-based shipbuilder had also proposed the amphibious ships as the potential basis for new command and control vessels , ballistic missile defense platforms with interceptors and additional radars, and a purpose-built humanitarian relief type – a multi-mission concept it calls Flight IIA. This would be possible thanks to the use of standardized mission spaces within the common hull, but the different types would not be rapidly reconfigurable after construction. With the added benefit of a well deck, a San Antonio -derived hospital ship might offer new capabilities over the Mercy and Comfort, able to get patients on board via helicopters or V-22 Osprey tilt-rotors, landing craft, or other small boats. This could both potentially speed up how fast personnel get to medical care, as well as offering more flexibility in how to get them to the ship at all in what could be a life-or-death situation. A Huntington Ingalls infographic describing the benefits of its San Antonio Flight IIA concept., Huntington Ingalls This commonality, combined with an in-production design, could make it a cost-effective proposition to buy additional San Antonio -based hospital variants on top of the existing buy, as well. Huntington Ingalls claims that based on its existing experience, plus the Navy’s established training and logistics pipelines, will make its updated version significantly cheaper to build and operate than the original examples. This cost factor could be an important consideration since a San Antonio -based ship may not be able to truly offer a one-for-one replacement for either Mercy or Comfort . The current versions of the landing platform dock are more than 200 feet shorter and a displacement of 25,300 tons – around a third of that of the dedicated hospital ships. In turn, it’s not clear whether it would be able to house a full Role 3 medical facility, as is the case with Mercy and Comfort . Based on the U.S. military’s definition , this level of capability includes multiple capable operating theaters, additional diagnostic facilities, and more specialized intensive care facilities, along with other on-board resources such as a blood bank and oxygen generation plant. There’s just a matter of overall volume, as well. Mercy and Comfort can accommodate up to 1,000 patients at a time, a floating medical capacity that simply does not exist in any other navy in the world. That being said, the existing San Antonios do already have space to accommodate an amphibious force of more than 700 individuals, along with garage and storage space for vehicles and other equipment, on top of their crew of more than 300 personnel. The Flight I San Antonio -class landing platform dock USS Arlington ., USN If it does have more limited capabilities, a San Antonio hospital ship might only be able to act as a more intermediary care center, with the Navy then having to develop operating concepts to rapidly move seriously injured patients on to more robust facilities. This could be a difficult proposition, especially during the kind of distributed operations Vice Admiral Merz mentioned as being increasingly important. These same issues apply to transforming the USS Lewis B. Puller , or either of her two future sister Expeditionary Sea Bases, into a floating hospital using modular medical packages. With the Navy only planning to acquire three of those highly specialized ships at present, it also difficult to imagine the service wanting to limit their capabilities by assigning them a single role. We at The War Zone previously examined this particular proposal in greater depth, which you can find here . The US Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base USS Lewis B. Puller. , USN Regardless, in any potential crisis in the Western Pacific, for example, the “tyranny of distance” could quickly place American forces hundreds, if not thousands of miles from more established medical care. It simply might not be practical to have hospital ships without a Role 3 capability, even if it might be possible to operate more of them for the same cost as Mercy or Comfort . And there is where a separate proposal from Austal USA might come into play. The Alabama-based subsidiary of Australian firm Austal has pitched an even smaller, more potentially distributed idea using the Spearhead -class Expeditionary Fast Transport , also known by the abbreviation EPF. Previously known as the Joint High Speed Vessel, or JHSV, the Navy eventually expects to have a fleet of 12 of these catamaran ships, which can reach a top speed of 50 miles per hour. The EPF would be even less able to carry a Role 3 medical facility, but might be able to act as a fast-moving link between a combat zone or other crisis area and larger afloat or land-based medical facilities. The Navy has already been using these ships as a means of quickly repositioning ground forces in the Pacific and is exploring other potential uses for the vessels, including as small, distributed platforms loaded with mine-hunting capabilities , unmanned aerial vehicles or tethered aerostats , or even stand-off weapons, such as electromagnetic railguns . The Expeditionary Fast Transport USNS Spearhead sails off Panama in 2016. A U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter in a medical evacuation configuration has just taken off and is flying in the foreground., USN Both Huntington Ingalls and Austal USA also note that their ships have flight decks that will be able to accommodate the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor , which could further extend their ability to rapidly accept, stabilize, and move patients onward for further treatment. As it stands now, the landing pads on Mercy and Comfort do not have the heat treating necessary to withstand the blast from that aircraft’s turboprop engines during a vertical take-off or landing. One of the Navy’s future missions could be an “a distributed hospital capability, and these are going to be fairly challenging requirements,” Vice Admiral Merz said at the April 2018 hearing. “It’s going to have to be able to support a V-22, for instance, so how do you manage the size of that and the speed and how it’s going to go.” Having some mix of less intensive medical ships that are cheaper to operate might also free up ships like Mercy and Comfort , or any future replacements, for more demanding missions, as well. A major criticism of the larger hospital ships is that it takes a significant amount of time and resources to activate them for any mission then the vessels often incur exorbitant costs just to perform limited humanitarian port visits where the crew might not even see 100 patients. While these sorts of “ soft power ,” non-combat missions are invaluable for advancing American interests abroad, it’s reasonable to ask whether this is an appropriate use of unique and specialized capabilities. At the same time, though, it’s not clear how using San Antonios or Spearheads would necessarily provide more operational flexibility or present a cost-effective alternative to a more purpose-built design akin to the existing Mercy or Comfort . The planned purchases of the landing platform docks and expeditionary fast transports are based on long-standing, established requirements. Putting them even semi-permanently into a dedicated medical role would prevent them from performing those other tasks. The USNS Mercy , right, and what was then the Joint High Speed Vessel USNS Millinocket , sail together in 2015. The Navy has since recategorized Millinocket as an Expeditionary Fast Transport., USN Purchasing additional ships of either class, no matter the potential cost savings, could be just as expensive a proposition as extending the life of the existing hospital ships or purchasing new ones. Even with a 30 percent reduction in unit price, the San Antonio FLight IIs would still be more than $1.4 billion apiece. The Spearheads are around $180 million each. The Navy only asked for $120 million in its most recent budget request for the 2019 fiscal year to sustain the Mercy and the Comfort , and has proposed putting Mercy in a reserve status with a skeleton crew for half the year that will trim $23 million from the typical annual operating costs. The service could increase that budget by a factor of 10 and it would still be cheaper than buying just one potentially less capable San Antonio -based hospital ship. However the Navy decides to proceed, it will have to do so relatively soon. Comfort is increasingly in desperate need of a major overhaul, which could sideline the ship for months and is among the factors that prompted the service to consider putting her into a reserve status or retiring her outright. Mercy is in better condition, but having just one of these ships would inherently limit the Navy’s ability to rapidly provide this capability or do so in multiple theaters at once. “[ Comfort ’s] replacement’s not ready, so we are evaluating what it would take to do a life extension on her,” Merz told legislators in April 2018. “Her sister ship is in good shape, she’ll be around for quite a while, and there may be other opportunities to fill in the sea-based medical support that we need to provide. So we’re casting a wide net on how to meet that specific capability.” All told, it seems increasingly clear that the Navy is interested in a more varied set of afloat medical capabilities. It remains to be seen whether a combination of smaller, less capable ships will truly be able to fill the gap leftover if the service does retire one or both of its specialized hospital ships.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 19, 2018",F-22 Raptor Came To A Rest On Its Belly During Major Mishap Friday At NAS Fallon (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An F-22A Raptor belonging to Elmendorf Air Force Base’s 3rd Wing was involved in a major mishap this weekend. Details remain sketchy and are likely to change, but a source told The War Zone that the jet may have retracted its gear too early during takeoff, with the aircraft slamming back down on the runway at relatively high speed and skidding its way to a stop. Thankfully the pilot was able to egress from the aircraft without major injuries. We contact the public affairs office at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson who jumped right on the story and quickly confirmed that the aircraft had been involved in a mishap at Fallon and although the damage is extensive, it is hoped that it can be repaired at this time. An investigation into the incident is currently underway. The F-22 was at NAS Fallon to support the Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program, better known as Topgun , providing a dissimilar adversary for students to fight against as part of a class graduation exercise. This is a widely known event in which Topgun students take part in a 1v1 fight against an unknown ‘surprise’ enemy aircraft. Aircraft of all types , from warbirds to foreign fighters, have been brought in to take part in the exercise over the decades. Related video-the F-22 seemingly doing the impossible: For a relatively small cadre of fighter aircraft—roughly just 125 out of 183 jets are combat coded at any given time—the F-22 community has experienced a number of gear-up and runway mishaps over the last half-decade or so. On May 31st, 2012 a student pilot on his second solo flight in the F-22 didn’t apply enough power before retracting the jet’s landing gear during departure. The F-22 sunk down and careened its way across the runway on its belly before coming to a stop. The cost to repair that jet was a whopping $35M and took six years to accomplish the task. The description of this mishap sounds similar to the one in Fallon on Friday, at least as it was described to us. But once again, this description could be inaccurate as we have not been able to verify it at this time. 2012 belly landing of an F-22 at Tyndall AFB., USAF In 2015 another Alaska-based Raptor had a brake issue on the runway at Honolulu International Airport causing damage to the aircraft. The jet was there for the 154th Fighter Wing’s annual Sentry Aloha exercise. Three years earlier another F-22, this one belonging to the local Hawaii Air National Guard 199th Fighter Squadron, experienced a tail-strike while landing. The repair bill for that mishap was $1.8M. Update: 1:20pm PST— The Air Force amn/nco/snco forum page on Facebook has posted new images of the stricken F-22 on NAS Fallon’s runway as well as a description of what they have been told caused the mishap. This should be treated as a rumor at this time, but in the images, the F-22’s thrust-vectoring nozzles are in asymmetric positions. The right engine looks as if it was shut down normally, while the left is still fully deflected downward. Here is the page’s entry: UPDATE from sources: “Info on the Raptor mishap at Fallon: The slide happened on takeoff. Appears to have been a left engine flameout when the pilot throttled up to take off. By the time he realized the engine was dead, he had already been airborne for a few seconds and raised the gear. The jet bounced for around 1500 feet, and then slide for about 5000 feet. They got it off the ground and on its landing gear last night, so the runway is clear. Chain is wanting it to be quiet still. It’s very fresh obviously. But it’s looking like the second engine failure on Elmo jets in a 7 day period.” Here is the entire post with the images: We will keep you updated on this mishap as more information comes available.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 14, 2018",Here Are All The Details The Pentagon Just Released Regarding Its Missile Attack On Syria (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been less than 12 hours since the United States, together with its French and British allies, launched a major series of standoff strikes against sites connected to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons arsenal. Our unique marathon coverage detailed these events moment-by-moment. The Pentagon has now provided additional information in a more comprehensive briefing. Here are the major details from the brief: – Pentagon chief spokesperson Dana White insisted that “this operation does not represent a change in US policy” and was not an attempt to unseat Assad or become involved in the Syrian Civil War. – It was a response to the Assad regime’s “illegal tactics” in continuing to use chemical weapons and reflected a moral imperative to intervene. – U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, the Director of the Joint Staff, said the Syrians had been unable to have any “material interference” in the operation and all the missiles reached their targets. – McKenzie said there had been no indication of a military response from “actors” within Syria, but that American troops in the country remained ready to defend themselves. – He described the mission, which was coordinated so that the 105 total standoff weapons all hit their targets around 4 AM local time in Syria, as “precise, overwhelming, effective.” – The operation “significantly crippled” Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and despite reports of evacuations of some production equipment and other materiel, some fixtures were likely too large to move to another, safe location. – 76 missiles struck the Barzah Research Center in Damascus, including 57 Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles (TLAM) and 19 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) air-launched cruise missiles. DoD – 22 missiles impacted the chemical weapon storage facility west of Homs, including nine TLAMs – all from U.S. ships – eight Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles from UK aircraft, three Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN) cruise missiles from French frigates, and two SCALP air-launched cruise missiles from French aircraft. DoD – Seven French SCALP missiles hit the associated bunker complex near the second target. DoD Naval assets included the U.S. Navy’s Virginia -class submarine USS John Warner , the Ticonderoga -class cruiser USS Monterey, and the Arleigh Burke -class destroyers USS Higgins and Laboon . – The Laboon and Monterey engaged targets from the Red Sea, Higgins fired missiles from the North Arabian Gulf, and John Warner was in the Mediterranean Sea. – In total, Monterey launched 30 TLAMs, Higgins launched 23, Laboon launched seven, and John Warner launched six. – The French Aquitaine -class frigate Languedoc also took part in the operation from the Mediterranean. – Air assets operated from bases throughout the region included US Air Force B-1B bombers, which fired all 19 JASSM-ER missiles, escorted by Air Force fighter jets. – UK Tornado GR4 jet combat aircraft and French Rafale and Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter jets also took part. The UK and France committed unspecified escorting fighter jets. – American defensive counter air packages were still flying sorties at the time of the briefing. – Lieutenant General McKenzie said the Syrians attempted to shoot down incoming missiles with 40 surface-to-air missiles using a “ballistic trajectory” and “without guidance.” – He added that those missiles “had to come down somewhere” and posed a danger to innocent bystanders. This image gives a basic idea of the vectors of attack and the parties involved in the strike but is not representative of the number or types of platforms used., DoD – McKenzie said the loss of the facilities would be significant for Assad, but declined to offer a more granular description about the residual status of the Syrian government’s chemical capabilities. – He did acknowledge that there still could be Syrian government chemical weapons attacks in the future and that there were additional chemical weapons related sites that the U.S. and its partners did not hit. – The general declined to elaborate on the other alternatives the U.S. military presented to the Trump administration, which ultimately decided to pursue this particular strike package. – Dana White stressed that the operation was different from the strike on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base and focused on neutering Assad’s chemical weapons production capability rather than delivery platforms. – Dana White declined repeatedly to elaborate on any evidence the United States had that the Syrian government had conducted the chemical weapon attack in Douma and what agents it used and said the U.S. government was still assessing the situation. – She did say the U.S. government remained “confident” that there had been a chemical weapon attack and the Syrian government was responsible. – McKenzie said that the U.S. military conducted a detailed targeting process, including “plume analysis” and other tasks, in order to mitigate the possible release of chemical agents from the strikes on any of the three sites. – He would not say if the U.S. military had conducted any post-attack air sampling, only that the post-strike assessments were coming through “a variety of means. – The deconfliction line with the Russians remains active, but McKenzie would not say if there had been any discussions via that communications line regarding the strikes specifically. – Dana White put the onus on Assad, as well as his Russian and Iranian benefactors, in whether or not the United States would feel compelled to act again in response to another chemical weapon attack. – She said the Russian-sponsored Sochi peace plan “has failed” and that the United States remained committed to the United Nations-backed Geneva peace process to end the country’s civil war. – The U.S. government also noted that there had been a noted uptick in Russian-enabled disinformation regarding the situation in Syria in the aftermath of the strikes. There were many additional things we posted about in our marathon coverage last night that either wasn’t discussed in this brief or will add a lot of color to what was said during it. I would highly suggest you run through it to get fully up to speed on the larger picture, one not manicured by the DoD. Beyond the facts presented, there were many questions as to the legitimacy of the targets and the qualifications for the strike considering so many have died from previous chlorine attacks. The back and forth with the press was quite interesting. The media does not seem as in love with this strike as it was with the last one. Watch the entire presser here: https://youtube.com/watch?v=N-9oaIrvujM We will update this post with more information as it comes available, but we are saving our analysis for another post, and there is a lot to talk discuss, to say the least. This operation has huge implications and takeaways on tactical, strategic, and broader geopolitical levels. Update: 11:40am EST— A Pentagon spokesperson had told Defense News that F-22 stealth fighters, a common sight over Syria, did not escort the B-1B bombers as they made their way toward the target area. Instead, a force package of fourth generation fighters and EA-6B Prowlers did provide physical and electronic warfare defenses for the bombers. The aging Prowlers have left service with the U.S. Navy and the only such aircraft in the region are those assigned to the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command (SPMAGTF-CR-CC), which has forces throughout the Middle East. The unit’s air component , which has included F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets, AV-8B Harrier jump jets, and MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotors in the past, was understood to be situated at Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait as of 2015. There are separate reports that more recent EA-6B deployments went to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. This could very well be the last large force employment combat use for the EA-6B, which the Marine Corps is set to retire completely in 2019. It’ll be sad to see those planes go, but what a great and historic send off this is and they may have been the single type of aircraft providing dedicated electronic warfare support during the mission. Update: 12:00pm EST— Independent satellite imagery of the target areas from before and after the strikes is becoming to emerge online and shows significant damage to the sites, especially the Barzah Research Center, which has effectively ceased to exist. Update: 12:15pm EST— At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on April 14, 2018, Ambassadors from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France sparred with their Russian counterpart over the legitimacy of the strikes. The four countries, as well as China, are the only permanent members of the international body. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the Trump Administration was “locked and loaded” to respond to any future Syrian government use of chemical weapons, while France’s François Delattre noted that his country had warned that the chemical weapon attack in Douma would not go unanswered. He added that the U.N. Charter was “not designed to protect criminals,” referring to Syria’s dictator Bashar Al Assad. Russia’s Vasily Nebenzya, not surprisingly, decried the entire operation as “international hooliganism.” Prior to the strikes, the Russian government and media outlets in that country advanced a number of unfounded conspiracy theories about the events in Douma, with the most recent being that the United Kingdom, in cooperation with Assad’s opponents in Syria, fabricated the entire incident . At the end of the meeting, Russia requested a vote on a resolution condemning the strikes. China and Bolivia were the only other Council members to vote in favor of the proposal. The United States, United Kingdom, France, and five other members voted against it, while the remaining four representatives abstained. Update: 2:10pm EST— Senior Trump Administration officials are now saying that they have a high degree of confidence that the Syrian government employed a mixture of both Chlorine and Sarin in the attack on Douma.  This appears to be based on both intelligence and open source information from individuals and non-governmental groups on the ground. In addition, the same reiterated that Assad’s regime does likely continue to possess some amount of chemical weapons and related infrastructure, which it could employ in future attacks. This is in line with Lieutenant General McKenzie’s caveats during the Pentagon press briefing earlier on April 14, 2018. Update: 4:55pm EST— The Pentagon has released additional footage relating to the strike, including an uncommon periscope view from the USS John Warner as the submarine launched one of its six TLAMs. Update: 5:30pm EST— It appears that Israel has taken the opportunity of the American-led strikes against Assad to launch another punitive attack against Iran and its proxies in the country. Details remain scarce, but there were reports of a number of large explosions at an Iranian-managed facility near the city of Aleppo that is also home to Hezbollah fighters and other Iranian-supported militias. This would be the second Israeli strike in Syria within a week. On April 8, 2018, Israel reportedly struck the T4 Air Base in Homs, which Iran had been operating from in cooperation with Syrian forces, in the immediate aftermath of the Douma chemical weapons attack. It’s not clear whether or not those two events were necessarily related. Israel has repeatedly made clear that it sees Iran strengthening its military posture in Syria as unacceptable and has conducted a number of strikes in the past 18 months against that countries forces, as well as Hezbollah. Earlier in April 2018, the Israeli government disclosed that an Iranian drone it had shot down in February 2018 was armed and appeared to be attempting to make an attack on Israeli soil. That incident touched off a major Israeli response into Syria, where the unmanned aircraft took off from, resulting in an equally significant response from Syrian air defense forces, resulting in the loss of one of Israel’s F-16I Sufa multi-role fighter jets. The United States did reportedly alert Israel of the impending strikes against Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a public statement afterward in support of the operation.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 19, 2017",Navy F/A-18 Legacy Hornets Have Taken Their Last Cruise Aboard A U.S. Aircraft Carrier,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s F/A-18 ‘Legacy’ Hornets have made their final cruise aboard an aircraft carrier. VFA-34 “Blue Blasters” had the honor of putting the F/A-18C through its final operational deployment aboard the USS Carl Vinson, which just returned from a three-month cruise. During that deployment, the Carl Vinson made history by being the first American aircraft carrier to make a port visit in Vietnam. The news that this cruise will be the last for the Navy’s Legacy Hornets came as a surprise to many. Our friends over at Scramble Magazine were the first to report it on their Facebook page , stating: “On 11 April 2018, Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 34 Blue Blasters (‘NE-4xx’) arrived back home at NAS Oceana (VA) after a three-month deployment with CVW-2 on board the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70). The F/A-18C squadron embarked on 5 January 2018 the Vinson. The deployment marked the sundown cruise of the US Navy F/A-18C Hornet. CVW-3’s VFA-131 Wildcats (‘AC-3xx’) and CVW-8’s VFA-37 Bulls (‘AJ-4xx’) still operate the legacy F/A-18C Hornet but these squadrons will not deploy anymore with these types. VFA-34 will transition to F/A-18E Super Hornet in the upcoming months, likewise followed by VFA-131 and VFA-37.” USN We quickly contacted the Navy’s Pacific Fleet headquarters to verify the report and initially, they seemed as surprised and interested as we were. They quickly put us in contact with Commander Ronald Flanders, spokesman for Commander Naval Air Forces, who confirmed that this was indeed the last cruise for the Navy’s Legacy Hornets. VFA-34, as part of the Carl Vinson’s Carrier Air Wing Two, is still scheduled to take part in the Navy’s Rim of the Pacific multi-national war games this summer, but that will only be a short training deployment aboard the carrier. The squadron will transition to the Super Hornet early next year. The Blue Blasters originally from A-6 Intruders to F/A-18 Hornets back in 1996. Legacy Hornets will still remain in the Navy’s inventory for a variety of roles going forward, including serving in reserve and aggressor squadrons , at the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center at NAS Fallon, and with a handful of other squadrons that will also be transitioning to the Super Hornet fairly soon. Commander Flanders also noted that the Legacy Hornet is ending its carrier deployment carrier while VFA-147 “Argonauts” are transitioning to the F-35C, the first front-line strike-fighter squadron to do so thus far. USN With its recently expanded budget, the Navy is ordering dozens of extra Super Hornets in the advanced Block III configuration over the coming years, as well as beginning to field the F-35C to operational units. The seagoing service is also starting to put its oldest Super Hornets through a service life extension upgrade. All combined, this new plan will allow many Navy F/A-18A+s and F/A-18Cs to be transferred to the USMC to help bolster their very tired Hornet fleet both in terms of providing fresher aircraft and a ton of dearly needed spare parts. So even though it’s always a bitter-sweet moment when any aircraft type ends a major portion of its operational run, Legacy Hornets will be around for at least another decade, and likely even after that with the help of some targeted upgrades . The sweetest part is that the Navy is getting a bunch of new aircraft to replace their fleet Legacy Hornets with and those jets have exciting new capabilities some of which the service has waited decades to acquire. In retrospect, the first operational cruise of the F/A-18 Hornet occurred when strike-fighter squadrons VFA-25 and VFA-113 deployed aboard USS Constellation in 1985—33 years ago. That’s one hell of a run.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 10, 2018","United States, France, And UK Begin Air Strikes On Syria (Updating Live)","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly a week after a horrific chemical weapons attack in the Syrian city of Douma, President Donald Trump, in cooperation with his French and British counterparts, has approved a set of strikes against targets associated with the regime of Bashar Al Assad. After days of speculation and public threats suggesting the operation could be imminent, the announcement of the strikes finally came in the evening April 14, 2018 with the President addressing the nation directly from the White House. Trump said in his speech that the strikes were targeting the Syrian government’s chemical weapons capabilities. More importantly, Trump said that the campaign against the Syrian regime of dictator Bashar Al Assad would continue until such time as it was no longer necessary in order to send a strong deterrent message. “The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic and diplomatic,” Trump said in his address. “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.” Trump also made a direct appeal to Russia to join the United States and its allies in pressuring Assad to abandon the use of chemical weapons. He made a less direct statement to Iran, the Syrian government’s other principle benefactor. Both countries have already criticized the United States over its threats to intervene again against Assad’s regime and have threatened to retaliate in kind. “Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace,” he said. “Hopefully someday we’ll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not.” Update: 6:21pm PST— Explosions are being heard around Damascus. We also have good information that fighter aircraft were involved, likely launching air-launched cruise missiles from over the Eastern Mediterranean with the help of tanker support. French SCALP-EG, the UK’s Storm Shadow, and the American JASSM are likely to have been used, as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles from U.S. and UK submarines, as well as from U.S. Navy destroyers. Those fighters may also be providing air cover for American and allied ships in the region. Here is the statement from Theresa May: Update: 6:35pm PST— Talk of B-1Bs out of al Udeid involved in these strikes, likely firing standoff weaponry from the east. Also, we must note, this sounds like a protracted air campaign. What we are seeing now is likely also a destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) campaign so that other aircraft, namely B-2s, can get in and do some heavy hitting against hardened targets. It sounds like at least four major population centers in Syria are under attack. Update: 6:41pm PST— Here’s the first footage of RAF fighters recovering at RAF Cyprus following a wave of strikes. Once again, we believe the strikes are all standoff in nature at this time but that can change as Assad’s air defense network is degraded. Storm Shadow missiles from RAF GR4s confirmed by CNN. CNN also reports Syria’s 4th Division and Republican Guard being struck heavily. As predicted, this is a far larger campaign with a far wider scope target-wise than a year ago. Also regime targets are being struck as well according to multiple reports. Syrian authorities say they have shot down 13 missiles. Obviously this is not worth much as they always shoot down something according to them. Details are just beginning to emerge and this post will be updated in real time with all the information we can find. Update: 6:52pm PST— Hezbollah targets seem to be on the table for this operation and the Syrian PR response is already underway: Update: 6:59pm PST— Lot’s of different local Syrian reports and others that Russia’s airbase has gone active: Amazingly, this commercial flight is crossing over northern Syria! Not where all the action is but surely a lot of US aircraft in that area. Just as we have predicted: It seems that some attacks or responses the attacks are occuring not too far from Russia’s master airbase south of Latakia: Some tracer fire seen in Damascus as well as smoke: Update: 7:09pm PST— Mattis and Dunford Pentagon brief: Only retaliatory action has been surface to air missile activity, no losses so far reported. The target set has been executed and follow-up strikes don’t sound like they are imminent at this time. Russia was NOT warned of the attack but the targets were chosen to avoid Russian deaths. Dunford says the airspace was deconflicted with Russians via their hotline before the attack, yet at the same time says they did not warn Russia, which is laughable. They did not tell them about specific targets likely. Mattis says again, that no additional attacks are planned, so that seems to conflict at least in abstract from Trump’s statement. Late yesterday Mattis said he received proof of the chemical attack. Dunford says that the deconfliction information given to the Russians may have gone unnoticed as unique by Russia’s military. This is once again laughable. The United States does not operate in western Syria aside from unmanned aircraft operations. As such, Russia was noticed of this attack albeit not as to the targets that would be hit. Mattis warns Russia will execute a massive disinformation campaign over the coming days. More key points from Mattis and Dunford: – Mattis says that the US has a “vital national security interest” in deterring chemical weapons use in Syria and anywhere else and President Trump conducted the strike under his Article 2 authority as Commander in Chief to defend American interests. – Mattis: “Clearly the Assad regime did not get the message last year” – Mattis described strike as separate from the campaign against ISIS and directed at the Syrian regime – He called on “responsible nations” to denounce Assad and join with the U.S. government in pressuring Assad. – Dunford: Strikes began at 9 PM and there are no reports of casualties among the strike force at this time. – The targeting process included specific efforts to mitigate collateral damage and the possibility of threat to nearby communities from the release of chemical agents. – One target was a scientific research facility in the Damascus area. – A second target was a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs, said to be the primary stockpile of Sarin and precursor chemicals. – A third target was another chemical weapons storage facility and associated command post. – Mattis: The US and its allies are prepared to respond to further CW use in the future, but said that this particular operation is a “one time shot.” – Mattis: “I am confident the Syrian regime conducted a chemical attack on innocent people” involving at least one chemical agent, but that there might have been two. If this gas is chlorine alone, that would be strange as the U.S. has not responded to dozens of chlorine attacks over the last year. Roughly double the number of munitions were supposedly used in this operation compared to last year according to Mattis and Dunford. Update: 7:35pm PST— NATO chimes in on these strikes: Russia is making its first comments on the strikes: And now Russia’s U.S. embassy chimes in: Some new strike footage: Some new footage of pre-strike departures, Rafales loaded with SCALP-EG cruise missiles: Update: 7:56pm PST— It seems like more targets may have been hit, possibly air defense targets to help incoming missiles get through: Could Iran activate Hezbollah for large-scale barrages on Israel as a response: Some basic reporting on assets used at this time. Keep in mind this could all change: Canada’s statement: Facilitating USAF air power back to their bases: U.S. ambassador to Germany is trolling Berlin for not participating in the strikes: Update: 8:22pm PST— We have this exclusive photo that is said to show the B-1B used in the strikes all loaded up with JASSMs as we suspected. This sortie will mark the first combat use of this weapon. Anonymous Update: 8:30pm PST— Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova just stated the following, quoted from RT : “First, the Syrian people was subjected to Arab Spring, then Islamic State [IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL], now to ‘smart’ American missiles. A strike was carried out on the capital of a sovereign state, which for many years has been trying to survive under the threat of terror,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. She blamed “all those who claim moral leadership in this world, who declare their exceptionalism” for the attack, noting that “you should be really exceptional” to attack Syria at a time “when it was given a chance for a peaceful future.” Syria claims victory!: The Russian Navy may have watched Tomahawk launches up close and personal. This matches recent reporting on Russian naval movements in the Mediterranean: As we mentioned earlier, it looks like U.S. F-16s and F-15s provided counter-air screening against launches of Russian fighters and possible anti-ship missile attacks while this was underway. Update: 8:55pm PST— Supposedly Syria is firing on American drones now. Gotta get that bomb damage assessment! But really, we have no idea what unmanned capabilities are being used for this. A Global Hawk did a run along the Syrian coast after the strikes and its sensors can peer quite deeply into Syria. Update: 9:15pm PST— The Syrian government is now claiming to have shot down an unmanned aircraft using 2K12 Kub/SA-6 Gainful medium-range surface to air missile. So far there has been no independent confirmation and there are no details as to the type of drone they’re claiming to have destroyed. In addition, a spokesperson for Trump’s National Security Council has reportedly told the Associated Press that the President’s Tweets earlier in the week did, in fact, signal a clear intent to strike Syria in the near future. Update: 9:30pm PST— Russia has now issued a statement that none of its facilities in Syria came under attack. This is not surprising as the United States said it focused entirely on Assad’s regime and because targeting Russian forces directly would have risked a much more serious escalation. More interestingly, an anonymous source, according to Reuters, is now claiming that Russia tipped off the Syrians to the incoming attack, which could have happened when they received the American deconfliction alerts. This supposedly gave them time to evacuate some of the target sites. Update: 9:50pm PST— Check out this video that the Syrian government says shows U.S. missiles being engaged by Syrian air defenses: https://youtube.com/watch?v=pvwtuKY8D54 Update: 10:15pm PST— More from the Syrian government: “The Ministry of Information calls on citizens not to trust any media reports, which are deliberately or undeliberately exaggerating the number of targets and consequences of the trilateral aggression… Several missiles of the three countries, which struck a research facility have only caused material damage to a building, which includes an educational center and scientific labs.” Russia’s MoD claims nothing entered the air defense zones around their missile systems, whatever that means. “None of cruise missiles launched by the US and its allies did not enter the zone of responsibility of the Russian air defenses, covering objects in Tartus and Hmeymim ,” the Russian Defense Ministry has announced. Update: 10:40pm PST— There is a bunch of tanker activity over the Mediterranean again: Update: 10:51pm PST— We are getting the first images of RAF Tornados launching with Storm Shadow missiles under their bellies: MoD/Crown Copyright MoD/Crown Copyright Update: 11:05pm PST— Another first during this operation, a French FREMM frigate launched at least three Naval Cruise Missiles . These weapons are a close relative of the SCALP air-launched cruise missiles fired by Rafales during the same operation mission. Hat tip to @AirDefenseNet for the heads up! Based on our sources, at least four F-16s and four F-15s spent a lot of time between Cyprus and the Syrian coast as part of a single flight. These are the jets that likely provided counter-air screening, basically shutting down Russia’s air base and being ready to engage cruise missiles fired in that direction at allied sea or land targets. The F-16s may have played a contingency SEAD role and/or may have delivered missiles for the initial strike as well. They seemed to have stayed on station for hours during and following the strike. Update: 12:10am PST— Multiple reports that France also warned Russia ahead of the strikes. Update: 12:30am PST— Iran is now rattling their saber at the U.S., Reuters writes : “With this attack…the situation will become more complex, and this will surely be at the expense of the United States, which will be responsible for the aftermath of upcoming regional events that will certainly not be in their interest,” Yadollah Javani, the Guards’ deputy head for political affairs, told Fars news agency. Update: 1:00am PST— Russian MoD now says that they are reconsidering outfitting Syria and other regional players with S-300 and S-400 air defense systems after last night’s strike. They also say that dozens of missiles were fired at multiple airfields and none of them were hit with all missiles being shot down. The facilities that were hit were abandoned long ago. It also says that there are fighter patrols up over Syria now. CNN also reports that there are Russian jets orbiting over Homs and Damascus now. Update: 1:10am PST— Prime Minster May: -Four Tornados used in the attack with Storm Shadow missiles being launched at a chemical weapons facility west of Homs. -Recounting evidence, including the fact that a helicopter delivered a barrel bomb thought to have been the chemical weapon. -Three targets were chosen to minimize escalation, limit the possibility of injuries to innocent bystanders, and to impact Assad’s chemical weapons capability. -Restore/reinforce prohibition on chemical weapons. Update: 1:47am PST— Global Hawk back off Lebanon sucking up intel products for some very anxious intelligence analysts. Supposedly pieces of a Storm Shadow missile: UPDATE: 2:30am PST— Turkey has chimed in , here is their view of the strikes: “Turkey considers the operation carried out early this morning by the United States, United Kingdom and France to be an appropriate response to the chemical attack which caused the deaths of many civilians in Douma on 7 April. We welcome this operation which has eased humanity’s conscience in the face of the attack in Douma, largely suspected to have been carried out by the regime. Attacks with weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, that indiscriminately target civilians constitute crimes against humanity. The Syrian regime, which has been tyrannizing its own people for more than seven years, be it with conventional or chemical weapons, has a proven track record of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The conscience of the international community carries no doubt to that effect. Turkey believes that it is of critical importance that such crimes do not go unpunished and that accountability is ensured in order to prevent the recurrence of similar crimes. In light of this experience, it is essential for the international community, in particular the members of the UN Security Council, to agree upon joint steps to ensure that the use of chemical weapons does not go unpunished.” We cannot confirm this photo, but if it is true, that building is toast: Update: 3:37am PST— An interesting historical fact—today is the 32nd anniversary of Operation El Dorado Canyon. Update: 4:17am PST— Syria’s near invincible missile shield! Anything goes with these jokers: Apparently, this is one of the targets now: But what else should we expect after pouring over 100 standoff weapons onto just three limited target sets! This operation has huge implications and takeaways on a tactical, strategic, and broader geopolitical level. I am not going to begin writing up my analysis until much more info becomes available. Hopefully, we will get that info today. Update: 5:33am PST— First TLAM images: Looks like Syria is down a few SAMs: Looks like we were right on the money as far as those F-15s and F-16s executing defensive counter-air screen between Cyprus and the Syrian coast. Here they are landing back at Aviano all loaded up: Interesting to see if there was a standby SEAD package off the coast of any kind. “Mission Accomplished:” Here’s the map of the targets from the Pentagon: DoD We have concluded updates on this post!

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Aug 30, 2018",Azerbaijan’s Border Guard Has This Awesomely Bad Music Video With Tanks and Suicide Drones,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The internet really has radically defined the ways military and security forces , as well as defense contractors , can promote themselves, while also giving journalists and researchers copious amounts of extra material to pore over when looking for new and interesting tidbits. Case in point, a recent and slickly produced music video from Azerbaijan’s State Border Service, featuring a former contestant on The Voice of Azerbaijan , along with a full band, performing around tanks, armed helicopters, and patrol boats. It even includes the launch of Israeli-made suicide drones . Azerbaijan’s border guard posted the music video, titled “Ways of the Queen” and staring Narmin Karimbayova and Nur Group, on its official YouTube channel, which is a thing that most definitely exists , on April 11, 2018. Joseph Dempsey , a defense researcher with the International Insitute for Strategic Studies, was among the first to notice that, in addition to a catchy song, the full production offered an unusually detailed look at some of the small Caucasus country’s most advanced weaponry. It also prominently features clips of dictatorial President Ilham Aliyev, who has run the country since 2003, when his father, Heydar Aliyev, died. It’s not clear whether or not all of the systems in the video belong to the State Border Service, which Heydar created by presidential decree in 2002. Previously part of the Ministry of Interior, the organization now includes ground, air, and naval forces that patrol the country’s boundaries on land and in the Caspian Sea. This gives the group a prominent role in Azerbaijan’s simmering conflict with neighboring Armenia over a disputed region known as Nagorno-Karabakh or simply Karabakh. The music video has a visibly patriotic and nationalistic tenor, but with a pop song beat. It’s worth watching in its entirety. Beyond the spectacle of the thing, there are a number of particular weapons worth pointing out. Most notably, briefly, beginning at the 1:54 mark in the runtime, there is a clip of a truck-mounted launcher firing an Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Harop loitering munition . Both Azerbaijan and the manufacturer have largely declined to confirm publicly that the Azerbaijanis security forces have and are employing the system in combat. In April 2016, a number of the weapons reportedly struck Armenian-backed rebels in Nagorno-Karabakh during an outburst of fighting. An Azerbaijani Harop loitering munition blasts off from its truck-mounted launcher., Azerbaijan State Border Service capture Here’s how The War Zone’s own Tyler Rogoway describes this system , which is an improved version of the earlier IAI Harpy suicide drone: In the late 1990s, Israel began working on a follow-on to the Harpy.  It would be a larger design that could be reconfigured for multiple uses, including attacking radars, providing both electronic and electro-optical intelligence, attacking targets of opportunity on the ground (say, vehicles). Plus, it could even be outfitted to come back home and be reused again. Harop, with its folding wings, can be launched from a truck- or ship-mounted canister, or configured for air-launch. Once in the air, it can be operated by man-in-the-loop control or it can go about its mission totally autonomously. Either way, it can put its warhead to use, using its camera system and operator to track and engage moving targets or its radiation-seeker to sniff out and attack radar sites on its own. It can even be equipped for both missions at the same time, so that if a radar site were to go offline after a Harpy detected it, it can fly to its location and use electro-optical targeting to locate and kill it. A huge difference between Harop and the Harpy is range and loitering time, with the modern iteration packing about double that of its simpler predecessor,  or about 600 miles or six hours. That, plus the fact that it can be equipped to return home autonomously and land once its fuel runs low. Basically, the Harop—which has the radar signature of a small bird and virtually no infrared signature whatsoever—offers an inexpensive solution for many unmanned missions in a small, transportable, and optionally reusable package. You can imagine that if you are the enemy, having dozens or even hundreds of these things roaming your countryside during a time of conflict would be pretty terrifying. Azerbaijan, which has a tense relationship with Iran to the South, has subsequently developed strong ties with Israel and Harop isn’t the only example of Israeli-made weapons in the video. Karimbayova and Nur Group at times perform on the deck of the one of the Azerbaijani Coast Guard’s Sa’ar 62 offshore patrol vessel. These ships have, among other things, a Typhoon MLS-NLOS missile launcher, a navalized version of the Spike NLOS missile system, which is also a prominent feature in the video. As with Harop, these weapons have a fire-and-forget mode, using dual-mode Imaging Infrared and CCD seekers, as well as a man-in-the-loop control capability. Coupled with direct and top-attack flight profiles, the weapons can hit targets on land and at sea. An Azerbaijani Sa’ar 62 fires a MLS-NLOS missile in “Ways of the Queen.”, Azerbaijan State Border Service capture Otherwise, the video primarily features more mundane equipment. The State Border Service’s BTR-70 or -80 8×8 wheeled armored personnel carriers, Otokar Cobra 4×4 light armored vehicles, and unarmed Land Rovers, as well as a small number of T-72 tanks , are all featured. On top of the Sa’ar 62s, there are clips showing more or less the Coast Guard’s entire fleet, including smaller Soviet-era Stenka – and Zhuk -class patrol boats. At other points in “Ways of the Queen,” the organization’s fleet of Mi-17 Hip armed transport helicopters fire rockets and drop troops off. Don’t blink, or you might miss border guards firing South African-designed Milkor MGL six-shot revolving 40mm grenade launchers and the obscure Soviet-era APS underwater assault rifle at 0:22 and 1:48 in the video’s runtime, respectively. All told, it’s definitely worth less than five minutes of your time to watch Karimbayova’s ode to Azerbaijan’s State Border Service.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 11, 2018",Russia Blames UK For Faking Gas Attack While US Says It Has Proof Assad Was Behind It,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The rhetoric between the U.S. and Russia hasn’t been more pointed since the end of the Cold War. Now, as it appears a coalition of France, the UK, and the U.S. could strike at any moment, Russia now claims that the United Kingdom was behind the deadly gas attack in Douma, Syria. Russia says conclusively that the attacks were staged and that the footage of people being treated in its aftermath was actually of people who suffered “smoke poisoning.” Supposedly two men have told Russia how the incident was staged. The spokesman for Russia’s Ministry of Defense, Major General Igor Konashenkov, stated the following today: “Please, notice. These people do not hide their names. These are not some faceless claims on the social media by anonymous activists. They took part in taking that footage… The Russian Defense Ministry also has evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation in Eastern Ghouta… We know for certain that between April 3 and April 6 the so-called White Helmets were seriously pressured from London to speed up the provocation that they were preparing.” Kremlin mouthpiece RT.com wrote the following to describe the narrative the Ministry of Defense was trying to peddle: According to Konashenkov, the group, which was a primary source of photos and footage of the purported chemical attack, was informed of a large-scale artillery attack on Damascus planned by the Islamist group Army of Islam, which controlled Douma at the time. The White Helmets were ordered to arrange the provocation after retaliatory strikes by the Syrian government forces, which the shelling was certain to lead to, he said… One of the interviews published by the ministry showed a man who said his name was Halil Ajij, and who said he was a medical student working at Douma’s only operational hospital. This is how he described the origin of the footage: “On April 8, a bomb hit a building. The upper floors were damaged and a fire broke at the lower floors. Victims of that bombing were brought to us. People from the upper floors had smoke poisoning. We treated them, based on their suffocation.” Ajij said that a man unknown to him came and said there was a chemical attack and panic ensued. “Relatives of the victims started dousing each other with water. Other people, who didn’t seem to have medical training, started administering anti-asthma medicine to children. We didn’t see any patient with symptoms of a chemical weapons poisoning,” he said. RT also mentions the UK’s response to these allegations: The UK rejected the accusations, with British UN Ambassador Karen Pierce calling them “grotesque,” “a blatant lie” and “the worst piece of fake news we’ve yet seen from the Russian propaganda machine.” Russia’s repeatedly pushed conspiracy theories similar to this narrative in the weeks leading up to the gas attack, saying that something similar would happen and that it would be a hoax that will serve as a pretext for an attack by the U.S. and its allies. Accusing the UK somehow of being involved with all this as revenge for the UK’s claim that Moscow ordered the nerve agent attack on one of its former spies seems perfectly convenient. And beyond two guys who supposedly said the attack didn’t happen, the Russian MoD has put forward no credible evidence to support its claims. Russia went on to make the case that the international community should fall behind it because “Russia provides real help for real civilians in Syria, rather than hollow promises made by some western countries. Russia urges world community to join Russia and provide Syrians with necessary humanitarian aid.” Meanwhile, the Trump administration seems to have acquired enough proof regarding the source of the chemical weapons attack to satisfy its own threshold for launching an attack on Syrian government targets. Yesterday Secretary of Defense James Mattis seemed confident he knew who was behind the operation, but also cautioned that his main concern with executing punitive strike is that it could “escalate out of control.” Shortly after Mattis made those comments, it was reported that the U.S. had proof that chlorine and a nerve agent were found in the bloodstreams of victims of the gas attack in Douma. France has also said it had conclusive proof that Assad’s forces were behind that attack. Today, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated that the administration was confident Assad ordered the attack and that Russia is also to blame. Shortly after the White House press briefing, State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said that the administration has proof to back up their assertions. As for the UK, which had been timid about entering into a coalition with the U.S. and France without knowing more about the attack, Prime Minister Theresa May’s concerns have been satisfied as a phone call between her and President Trump concluded that action has to be taken in order to “deter further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.” While all this diplomatic posturing was occurring, there have been endless claims of military movements around the region, some of which are far better sourced than others. The American destroyer USS Winston Churchill has entered the 6th Fleet area of operations. The warship is likely to take up station in the eastern Medeterainian eventually alongside USS Donald Cook which is already there. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group and Carrier Air Wing One have also deployed from Norfolk on their way towards the area. But it will be days before they will arrive off Syrian waters, and that’s if it ends up even being the strike group’s final destination. There has been a constant presence of P-8s, RC-135s, and RQ-4s off Syria’s coast. As we have mentioned before, these aircraft are building up an up-to-date electronic order of battle for Syria. This information, which includes the location, type, and activity of air defense nodes and sensors, is critical for mission planning for missiles and aircraft and drastically increases their chances of survival. Other intelligence products can also be obtained via these flights, including critical communications intelligence that can give unique insights into how the Syrian military and Russian military are reacting to events and preparing for a possible strike. There have been many other reports of U.S. and allied capabilities moving into striking distance, but in reality, there is plenty of capability already there for such an operation and the ability to execute global strike missions with B-2 bombers from thousands of miles away should also be kept in mind. And no, American strikes do not only have to emanate from the Mediterranean. They can avoid the heart of Russia’s high-end air defenses by attacking from the east. Cruise missiles can even fly over Lebanon deep into southern Syria and then hook northwestwardly to attack their targets. Even B-2s can sortie from Guam or from the U.S., possibly stopping in Diego Garcia, before prosecuting their targets from the east. And of course, there is plenty of U.S. air power based in Europe, Jordan, and the Persian Gulf as well. Russian military movements have also made steady news in recent days, from Russian Navy ships supposedly vacating their berths in Tartus, Syria to Russia supposedly being allowed to use Iranian airspace and airfields for their heavy bombers. What exactly Russia would do with those aircraft is unknown as they would have a very hard time surviving America’s persistent air patrols over eastern Syria. We have already talked in-depth about Russia’s possible response to an American-led strike on Assad’s forces and capabilities, which could include launching their own cruise missile attacks on forwarding operating bases used by U.S. backed fighters in the country. As for the possible attack itself, it seems that Trump, May, and Macron have decided to do something, but when that something will occur remains a mystery. Currently, it is 1AM in Damascus and the weather is calm with sporadic clouds. The moon is only eight percent illuminated, and it will only be three percent tomorrow, which is the right conditions for use of B-2s and other low-observable platforms, and for special operations and combat search and rescue personnel to be able to do their jobs if called upon. With all this in mind, the strikes could come as soon as tonight and we are standing by to cover it in unique ‘marathon’ fashion.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 19, 2018",The Air Force May Have Managed A Way To Quietly Ground Roughly A Third Of The A-10 Fleet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Air Force has so far been able to avoid grounding dozens of its A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft that are still waiting for vital replacement wings . Unfortunately, serious questions remain about how long the service will be able to keep the entire fleet active, and whether it even really plans to, despite what had appeared to be increasing support from senior officials . During a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee on April 12, 2018, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, the service’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans, Programs, and Requirements, offered new information about the state of the A-10s. We at The War Zone had separately reached out for additional updates regarding groundings across the fleet, which includes aircraft assigned to active and reserve component units in the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard. As of April 2018, “zero active or reserve component A-10s are grounded for a lack of serviceable wings,” the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Fighter Bomber Directorate, which oversees the A-10 program, told The War Zone in a statement by Email. “The Air Force has used a collaborative approach between AFMC [Air Force Materiel Command] and the Using Commands and their units to alleviate groundings in [fiscal year 2018].” The A-10 re-winging program is a saga we at The War Zone have delved into many times in the past, but it’s safe to say that it was an unforced error on the part of the Air Force. Despite initial plans in 2007 to upgrade all of its approximately 280 aircraft with new “thick” wings, the service stopped after a little more than 170 had received the modifications. An Air Force Reserve A-10 Warthog on display., USAF Now, nearly 110 Warthogs continue to lack the new wings, which could keep them airworthy into the 2030s. In September 2017, U.S. Air Force General Ellen Pawlikowski, head of Air Force Materiel Command, said some of those aircraft could end up stuck on the ground for safety reasons by the beginning of the 2018 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2017. At the time of writing, the Air Force has not yet responded to our request for clarification as to what the collaborative approach it is using to avoid those groundings entails. However, at the hearing, Harris said that A-10s that were getting close to becoming unsafe to fly would rotate into the service’s backup inventory. We also do not know an approximate number of A-10s that are classified as “not mission capable” because they are undergoing depot maintenance, receiving upgrades or modifications, are broken down at a deployed location overseas. We do know that beyond the wing issue, no Warthogs were grounded for any reason as of April 2018. An A-10 undergoing heavy maintenance., USAF But needless to say, this is, at the very best, a short-term solution. Those backup aircraft, if they had to go back into service for any reason, would be facing the exact same life cycle issues and would likely have relatively few flight hours left before they would stop being safe to fly. This accounting trick also almost certainly has to rely on poaching suitable planes from one unit in order to give them to another in order to meet operational demands in places such as Iraq and Syria , Afghanistan , and South Korea . This sort of arrangement could only reduce the number of airworthy Warthogs left over for flight training and other activities help pilots remain proficient with the type. It’s also worth noting that in 2015, the Air Force attempted to circumvent legislation barring the service from retiring any A-10s by putting more than a dozen aircraft into backup status. This prompted an outcry from lawmakers, which forced it to reverse its plans. The video below offers a great look at the A-10’s combat contributions in Afghanistan. You can read here about why the Air Force tried to suppress its release. Overall, it’s a process that could quickly have diminishing returns and still lead to groundings before any new wings arrive . In March 2018, Congress passed a massive omnibus spending package that included $103 million to pay to restart production of the necessary components and buy four complete wing sets. The Air Force’s budget request for the 2019 fiscal year includes nearly $80 million for another eight to 12 sets. But the service doesn’t expect to issue a formal contract for the work until sometime in 2019 and it’s unclear when the actual upgrades would start, let alone be complete. “We are not confident we are flying all of the airplanes we currently possess through 2025,” Harris Lieutenant General had to concede in the April 2018 hearing. “We will have to get back to you on the groundings per year, per airplanes,” he added in a response to pointed questions from Martha McSally, a Republican Representative from Arizona and former A-10 pilot herself, who has been an outspoken critic of the service’s decisions regarding the aircraft. According to Harris, the Air Force does not want to commit to maintaining the full A-10 fleet until a fly-off between the Warthog and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter occurs. The service has long said it wants replace the ground attack aircraft entirely with the stealthy fighter multi-role jets, but Congress has demanded a comparative demonstration as part of the up-coming initial operational test and evaluation process. As noted, there seemed to be increasing support for the Warthog at the highest levels of the service, but how sincere that was and to what extent is now increasingly questionable. US Air Force personnel prepare to load a practice bomb onto an F-35A Joint Strike Fighter during a test. The service wants to replace the A-10s with these jets., USAF Harris did say that the Air Force was committed to avoiding any groundings after 2025 with the rebooted re-winging program, but then said that his service was uncertain about maintaining any more than six A-10s squadrons in total through 2030. This reflects plans to increase the total size the three active duty squadrons from 18 to 24 airframes and add an additional aircraft to three more reserve component squadrons. Of course, what Harris did not explicitly say is that this would mean the permanent retirement of the remaining more 80 “thin wing” A-10s the service has not yet budgeted to upgrade, as well as the shuttering of three of the present nine Warthog squadrons. We at The War Zone had already noted that this reality appeared to be increasingly inevitable . During the hearing, McSally was understandably incredulous of the Air Force’s plans. She questioned the service’s rationale and whether or not it would hamper its ability to meet demands for the ground attack aircraft in the immediate future. “How would we provide that capability to the combatant commanders if we went down to six?” she remarked. “I just don’t see it.” An A-10 from the 188th Fighter Wing with its trademark Warthog nose art., USAF The problem is, deliberately or not, the Air Force has backed itself into a corner where there are few functional alternatives. Grounding dozens of aircraft has a cascading impact on the readiness of the squadrons involved and raises legitimate questions about the utility of keeping personnel assigned to units with few flyable aircraft, especially amidst a historic shortage of pilots and other personnel . As we here at The War Zone have repeatedly stressed for years , the battle over the future of the A-10 is still very much active . But it increasingly appears that dozens of Warthogs are headed for the boneyard and there might not be much anyone can do about it. Editor’s note: Title was tweaked to reflect the fluid nature of the A-10 fleet’s flyable status. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Oct 26, 2018",Little Crappy Ship: None Of The Navy’s Littoral Combat Ships May Deploy In 2018,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Even though the U.S. Navy has already commissioned a nearly a dozen Littoral Combat Ships into service, it may turn out that not a single one of those vessels gets deployed operationally in the entirety of 2018. The LCS program just can’t get a win even after a broad and controversial restructuring program that saw the first four LCS hulls get turned into undeployable training ships. In addition, two squadrons of four Littoral Combat Ships were established to supposedly help readiness and to enhance the quality of the two crews assigned to each vessel. This stunning report comes to us from USNI News’ Megan Eckstein who broke down the absurd situation in granular detail. The article is a must read in full and is linked here , but suffice it to say the fact that the program can’t come near to meeting its already downgraded goals is another glaring example of just how flawed the LCS initiative was and remains to this very day. Eckstein writes in her report: “Three of the Navy’s four original LCSs are in maintenance now, and four of the eight block-buy ships that have commissioned already are undergoing their initial Post Shakedown Availabilities (PSA), Cmdr. John Perkins, spokesman for Naval Surface Force Pacific, told USNI News. In addition to the deploying ships themselves being in maintenance, so too are the training ships that will be required to help train and certify the crews. The Navy upended its LCS training and manning plans in 2016 when then-SURFOR commander Vice Adm. Tom Rowden announced a change to a blue-gold crewing model and a ship reorganization: hulls 1 through 4 serve in San Diego as a test division, to help test mission module components and get them fielded; the remaining ships are divided into divisions of four ships each, responsible for either surface warfare, mine countermeasures or anti-submarine warfare. Within each division, the first ship has a more experienced crew that is responsible for training and certifying the rest of the crews, and the other three ships are deployable assets. Due to this model, not only does the deployable ship have to be in the water and ready for operations, but so does the training ship.” Due to a number of delays, retrofitting requirements, extended maintenance periods, mishaps, testing demands and so on, the plan to send two Independence class LCSs to Singapore and one Freedom class LCS to Bahrain this year are very unlikely to come to fruition. It’s worth noting that till this very day, the ships that were built for littoral combat operations have yet to deploy to the U.S. Navy’s preeminent littoral combat theater, the Persian Gulf. Additionally, two LCSs have yet to be forward deployed to the same place at the same time. USS Freedom , now a training ship, getting work done in drydock., USN USNI News also notes the fact that the trimaran-hull Independence class requires a drydock for virtually any maintenance availability. Considering that all the ships in the class are homeported on the west coast, and drydocks for Navy vessels are already in short supply , this will only exacerbate the vessels’ availability issues. Testing needs for delayed mission modules and weapons systems also impact the LCS fleet’s ability to actually do its job in the real world. But it seems like a very hard pill to swallow that out of a cadre of 11 operational ships, more than half of them are being used as training vessels. And overall, this just underscores how downright stupid the Littoral Combat Ship concept was from its very beginning. These were the ships that were supposed to be cheap, highly flexible, extremely efficient and very deployable. They ended up being none of those things. Eventually, the LCS program will reach some form of stability, but what exactly that will look like remains unclear. Above all else, it is getting ever more doubtful that their effectiveness and capabilities will ever come close to outweighing the opportunity cost the program has sucked down over the years. USN The Navy seems to have already made up its mind when it comes to the LCS program, having truncated its original buy from 55 down to 32 hulls. Now the seagoing service is focusing on what many of us have pleaded for years, a modern frigate with area air defense capabilities. That program, dubbed the FFG(X) is running full steam ahead, and its largely ‘off-the-shelf’ nature means that it is a relatively low risk, rapid acquisition affair, with the first ships entering service around 2025. Even a decade after the first Littoral Combat Ship was commissioned, the program is still a mess. It hasn’t even fielded a close-range missile system yet beyond the testing stage and the quickly deployable mission module concept that was supposedly so innovative and promising has been all but abandoned. Maybe America’s Navy would be better off without LCSs at all. Shipbuilding politics and the need to protect a diversified industrial shipbuilding base are some of the main arguments as to why the program still exists, along with the Navy’s somewhat arbitrary goal of upping its hull numbers. USS Detroit during its commissioning ceremony., USN Some have proposed canceling any further LCS purchases regardless of penalties—many ships are under construction in one form or another—or politics and transferring the fleet to the Coast Guard or selling them off to our allies. Funds would be better spent buying new frigates and smaller and far cheaper vessels for more mundane tasks. The rapid procurement of advanced, forward-deployable diesel-electric submarines may be the best use of the LCS budget of all. Sadly, none of this will happen so the Navy will have to figure out how to make the most logical use of these ships as possible. And having two crews per a vessel, and all the training demands that go with it, may not be the best idea, especially for ships that so far have proven to be less than reliable. USN Whatever the future holds for the LCS, 2018 looks to be a year of hard knocks for the troubled program, and it should serve as a reminder of what the U.S. military is left to deal with after a bad idea is systemically hammered through the procurement process to the point that it is truly too big to fail.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 13, 2018","The F-35 Hits A Key Developmental Milestone, But With Watered-Down Requirements","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than a decade, the F-35 program has reached a major milestone and finished flight tests related to the System Development and Demonstration phase, or SDD. But as with anything relating to the Joint Strike Fighter , this announcement comes with significant caveats and amid new controversies, including that the Joint Program Office deleted a number of test points in order to meet its goals and still couldn’t meet a much revised schedule. One of the U.S. Navy’s operational test F-35C, known as CF-2, completed the last SDD flight test on April 11, 2018. The objective of that particular experiment was to gather load carrying data regarding the simultaneous external underwing carriage of two 2,000-pound class GBU-31/B Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) GPS-guided bombs and two AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In total, since 2006, the Joint Strike Fighter program’s Integrated Test Force completed more than 17,000 flight hours across 9,200 test flights, which hit more than 65,000 test points relating to the aircraft’s various mission systems and weapons employment. “Completing F-35 SDD flight test is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication from the joint government and industry team,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, head of the F-35 Joint Program Office, said in a statement on April 12, 2018. “The F-35 flight test program represents the most comprehensive, rigorous, and the safest developmental flight test program in aviation history,” Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin’s Vice President and General Manager for the F-35 program, declared. The nearly 12 year long effort, which cost approximately $60 billion dollars, included more than 180 weapon separation tests, nearly 50 weapon delivery accuracy tests, and more than 30 mission effectiveness tests. The latter events included multi-ship missions with as many as eight F-35s flying together. CF-02, one of the US Navy’s operational test F-35Cs, lands at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland on April 11, 2018, after completing its historic test flight., Lockheed Martin There were six deployments of Navy and Marine Corps F-35s from the Integrated Test Team aboard Navy ships, as well. Marine F-35Bs conducted more than 1,500 vertical landing-related tests both at sea and on land. The completion of these flight tests paves the way for the aircraft to finally start independent initial operational test and evaluation, or IOT&E, to fully assess the readiness of the three F-35 variants for actual combat. Only after that process finishes up will the program officially complete its SDD phase. After that, the Pentagon will be able to officially approve full-rate production of the aircraft if the jets have successfully met the test parameters. Keep in mind that the services are already buying 77 F-35s this year, so “full-rate production” isn’t really a relative term. One would imagine that all of this would be cause for celebration from both the F-35’s supporters and critics. This is an important development for a program with such a troubled developmental history and would appear to be a demonstration of actual and significant progress after years of delays and other issues. But as always seems to be the case with regards to the F-35, the announcement is already mired in controversy. Most immediately, this announcement was originally supposed to have come in January 2018. In an annual review of the program it released in January 2018, the Pentagon’s Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which oversees all such activities across the U.S. military, had said that timetable was optimistic. This office, commonly referred to simply as DOT&E, expected the last SDD flight tests to likely come later in the second quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. That quarter ended on March 30, 2018. And this is to say nothing of previous delays, as well as the Pentagon’s decision to “ re-baseline ” the program entirely, effectively shifting the goal posts dramatically, in 2011. The full-rate production decision is already five years behind schedule, at least according to the schedule as it existed in 2009 . An operational test F-35C during an earlier test flight., Lockheed Martin Perhaps more worrying is the fact that, despite gathering data on more than 65,000 test points, the F-35 program only met this much delayed SDD flight test schedule by deleting additional test points and accepting potentially flawed data. According to DOT&E, significant numbers of test flights involved aircraft with earlier editions of the critical, but troublesome onboard mission software, among other things, which may not reflect the actual capabilities of the stealth fighters as they exist now. Even with the latest iteration of the Block 3F software package, which Lockheed Martin and the Air Force both touted as providing “ full combat capability ,” there were dozens of known deficiencies remaining as of September 2017, which was when the reporting period for DOT&E’s most recent review ended. Some of those affect weapon accuracy, such as a persistent error that causes the F-35A’s internal 25mm cannon to reportedly still shoot to the right of the pilot’s point of aim. The Joint Program Office has been watering down the software requirements for years already, too, securing an interim, limited capability Block 3i software suite to meet some early test objectives and avoid even more embarrassing delays . Before that, the baseline Block 3 was supposed to represent a fully functional package, a requirement the initial iterations of the supposedly “final” Block 3F code failed to meet , as well. It could also otherwise impede the ability of the aircraft’s various complex systems to properly share and display information to the pilot, other F-35s and different aircraft , or throughout ground-based networks . There are other ongoing occupational hazards , as well, including worrying reports of incidents of hypoxia-like symptoms among pilots flying Air Force F-35As. Marine and Navy F-35 pilots have reported a “ green glow ” in their helmet’s display that can dangerously obscure their vision at night, especially during attempts to land on aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, as well. Lockheed Martin has only recently begun to implement fixes for that problem across the B and C model fleets. The video below includes footage showing problems F-35 pilots have experienced with the displays on their helmets. Lockheed Martin does not even expect to have finished installing production-representative software and other modifications on the entire fleet of 23 operational test F-35s until August 2018, according to DOT&E. In addition, thanks to a process known as concurrency , the U.S. military already owns hundreds of F-35s that could also need costly modifications or end up relegated to secondary, non-combat roles. Even then, problems with earlier systems mean that those older aircraft have some of the lowest availability rates. In March 2018, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Steven Rudder, the service’s Deputy Commandant for Aviation, told members of Congress that, on average, less than 40 percent of his F-35Bs with the older Block 2B were mission capable at any one time. And yet, the Joint Program Office has continued to argue that it will be able to mitigate these issues through another concurrent process, known as Continuous Capability Development and Delivery, or C2D2. This multi-billion dollar effort, the requirements of which remains largely undefined by Vice Admiral Winter’s own admission at the March 2018 hearing, will add in many of the still missing features as fixes to the software and physical components become available. All of this can only call into question whether the F-35s that perform the up-coming IOT&E tests will reflect the true capabilities of the existing fleet or future aircraft, whether they pass or fail in those events. It also does nothing to address what growing issues Lockheed Martin is having as it works to scale up its production capacity and concerns about the operating and long-term sustainment costs for such an advanced platform. During the March 2018 hearing, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jerry Harris, Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans, Programs, and Requirements, said that it was still costing his service approximately $50,000 per flight hour to fly its F-35As, roughly twice the cost per flight hour to fly an F-16C/D Viper , which the Joint Strike Fighters are slated to replace . On April 11, 2018, a report from Reuters revealed that the F-35 Joint Program Office had stopped accepting new aircraft over a contract dispute regarding the bill for a so-called “ quality escape ” related to a corrosion issue that emerged in 2017. Though Lockheed Martin has solved the defect, which would have impacted the aircraft’s low-observable capabilities, it is now locked in a dispute with U.S. government over who will pay what costs associated with those repairs and any other related corrective actions. F-35s under construction., Lockheed Martin “Per the direction of the program executive officer, F-35 deliveries have been temporarily paused while the government and Lockheed Martin reach an agreement on a contractual issue regarding repair work to remediate the known aircraft fastener hole primer quality escape,” the F-35 joint program office said in a statement to Defense News . “This is not a safety of flight issue but rather a contractual resourcing issue that needs to be resolved. The government has implemented this pause to ensure the warfighter receives a quality product from industry.” The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor is also in the midst of tense negotiations with the U.S. military over the sale of another block of low-production aircraft. In February 2018, Vice Admiral Winter went so far as to complain to the press that Lockheed Martin was being almost painfully uncooperative over the deal and that the F-35’s unit costs remained too high across all three variants. Earlier that month, Ellen Lord, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, effectively the Pentagon’s top purchasing officer, said that the Department of Defense as a whole would be unable to pay for the planned fleets of Joint Strike Fighters in the long term unless the sustainment costs came down . So, while the F-35 program has apparently successfully met the demands of its extended SDD flight test schedule, it remains unclear how representative that data is of the aircraft or its capabilities, at present or in the future. Even if it is, which may become more apparent during the ITO&E process, there remain other serious questions about the long-term viability of the service’s existing plans for the aircraft. A US Air Force maintainer inspects an F-35A., USAF And while this latest milestone does show the F-35 project is making real progress, the manner in which it has occurred is yet another example of official pronouncements employing obtuse and “technically correct” verbiage that can obscure the obvious and still significant issues that project faces. This only diminishes the impact of positive news that emerges since it is immediately bogged down in caveats and asterisks . In this case, continuing to press ahead with an aircraft that might not be ready or based on information gathered using aircraft that may not reflect the state of the fleet as a whole, including aircraft the Air Force and Marine Corps have already committed to combat operations without the benefit of independent IOT&E tests, could also lead to both embarrassment and more dangerous miscalculations in the future. It is important for both aviators and combatant commanders to have a good understanding of the capabilities available to them and confidence that those systems will be able to perform in potentially life-and-death situations. The Navy continues to decline to declare an initial operational capability with the F-35C until the SDD phase is complete. There are also plans in the works to eventually shutter the Joint Program Office and let the individual services decide the fate of their F-35s independently. In the meantime, it offers no benefit to the security of the United States to field weapon systems that lack significant capabilities for any reason without being honest about those issues. The multi-national nature of the F-35 program means that these decisions impact the capabilities and credibility of nearly a dozen allies, and potentially more , as well. The Pentagon’s refusal to accept the most recent batch of jets over the contract dispute will delay the delivery of one to Australia and another Norway, underscoring the interdependence inherent in the program for many smaller participants. All told, it is definitely a good thing that the F-35 program is moving forward in its testing process, but lessons must be learned from its troubled history and it does no good to rush ahead only to create an illusion of real progress.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 14, 2018",Mattis’s Top Worry On Syrian Strike Is “Keeping It From Escalating Out Of Control”,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Secretary of Defense James Mattis sat before the House Armed Services Committee today. During the hearing, Representative Nikki Tsongas of Massachusetts asked a number of questions regarding Syria, including how strikes against the Assad regime could impact the mission overall. Although he was only willing to say so much due to operational concerns, Mattis was quite frank with his reply as to what worries him the most about such an operation. The retired general turned Trump administration cabinet official noted two major concerns. First is a tactical concern that the strikes could harm civilians which would be totally counter-productive to what they are intended to do, let alone to the U.S. mission’s overall goals in the county. Second is an ominous strategic concern we at The War Zone have also voiced repeatedly , that the strikes could be the catalyst that ignites a much broader conflict with Russia. Mattis told Tsongas: “On a strategic level, it’s how do we keep this from escalating out of control, uh, if you get my drift on that.” You can watch the entire hearing here , the part mentioned above occurs beginning at around the 41 minute mark. Mattis also called the attack inexcusable and said he hopes inspectors will be allowed at the site in the coming week, but notes that those inspectors won’t be able to tell who launched the attack, just what type of gas was used. Waiting for more conclusive information surrounding the use of chemical weapons in Douma is something that UK Prime Minister Theresa May also seems to be waiting for before she makes the decision to participate in a military operation against the Assad regime or not. But just after Mattis ended his testimony, news broke that blood and urine samples taken in Douma at the site of the attack did indeed contain both chlorine and some type of nerve agent. France has also claimed that it has proof that the Assad regime executed the attack. It’s unclear how these developments will impact any timetable for what will likely be a series of strikes. After boasting that American missiles will soon be heading towards Syria yesterday morning, President Trump has taken a much more muted tone as to where he stands on even deciding whether to strike or not. Mattis also repeatedly implied that the decision to strike Syria still hasn’t been made, although all of this could very well be an effort to regain some element of surprise after the President’s outbursts yesterday. There are also reports that the White House is looking at eight targets , including two airfields, a chemical weapons facility, and a research station for its attack plan. Currently, it is 10:30pm in Damascus, the skies are relatively clear, and the moon is 14% illuminated. Tomorrow it drops to 8%, then to just 3% on Saturday and weather looks clear in the coming days. Having no moon is ideal for putting certain assets to work, namely the B-2 bomber. Tomahawk cruise missiles are generally unaffected by weather conditions and fly low enough that the moon’s illumination state is not much of a factor.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jul 20, 2018",Army Shows Off Awesome Automatic Mortar System That’s Still Too Expensive To Field,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking to invest heavily in upgrading its long-range artillery capabilities , including new howitzers , rockets , tactical missiles , and even railguns . At the same time, the service is working on a smaller, rapid-fire 81mm mortar with advanced computer-controlled features that reduce recoil, extend range, and improve accuracy that could offer extra firepower to smaller units. On April 6, 2018, soldiers from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, with help from the Army’s Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Command, experimented with the weapon, called the Automated Direct Indirect-fire Mortar (ADIM), during a multi-national training exercise in Germany. That event, known as the Robotic Complex Breach Concept, included a number of other advanced and prototype systems, including small drones, loitering munitions , and remote-controlled engineering vehicles. The main objective was to demonstrate how these various capabilities might enable a large mechanized force to break through various obstacles during a high-end conflict. “The breach is one of the most difficult tasks that soldiers can be faced with on the battlefield,” Keith Briggs, the assistant engineering lead for the exercise, told Army reporters . “The ADIM was a great asset to our breach today and definitely increased our survivability,” U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Cody Rothschild, a fire support officer from the 2nd Brigade’s 1st Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment, added. ADIM’s main components are the 81mm mortar mounted and a powered base that can rotate 360 degrees and elevate and depress the weapon’s barrel. As the name implies, troops can fire it indirectly like an artillery piece or straight at the enemy like a small infantry gun. The whole system sits on the back of a modified M1152A1 up-armored Humvee . But any similarities to a typical vehicle-mounted mortar end there. Most infantry mortars have no built-in recoil reduction mechanism, which is a feature generally more commonly found on larger howitzers and other guns. When Army soldiers fire their standard M252 81mm mortar, the force goes straight into the firing platform, whether it’s a vehicle or the ground. ADIM has a so-called soft-recoil system that sends the barrel sliding forward before it actually sends a projectile flying down range. The momentum helps counteract the recoil. The ADIM prototype moves into position during the Robotic Complex Breach Concept exercise., US Army This arrangement means that the weapon can withstand more recoil, but remain relatively compact. In turn, it can shoot rounds with larger propellant charges and therefore increased range, but without making the entire system significantly larger to handle the additional strain of firing that ammunition. On top of that, the mortar has a computer-controlled active recoil braking system that uses sensors to monitor the exact amount of force throughout the firing cycle. This further helps the system only accelerate and decelerate as necessary. An official briefing slide highlighting ADIM’s active-recoil components and offering additional performance details., US Army A typical hard- or soft-recoil system has to be built to withstand the highest expected recoil by default, even if troops rarely employ the weapon in that way. ADIM’s active-recoil components mean it can better account for fluctuating variables, such as different amounts of propellant, temperature variations, and small differences in manufacturing tolerances without the need to make the system larger and more robust. Army engineers say that, in general, a typical 81mm mortar would generate up to 10,000 pounds of recoil force, while the active-recoil enabled ADIM only produces a maximum of 2,000 pounds. This inherently makes the weapon more accurate, too, since there are fewer conflicting forces acting on the round as it leaves the barrel. Another briefing slide with a cut-away diagram of the braking mechanism itself., US Army In addition, there is a computerized fire control system that makes the weapon even more precise. This networked Automated Fire Control System-Mortar (AFCS-M) also means a centralized fire direction center can operate the weapon remotely, reducing the time it takes to go from a request for fire support to actually hitting the target. ADIM is also semi-automatic, able to feed from a 20-round magazine and fire around 30 rounds per minute. In theory, this means, a small crew could position the weapon, have other troops operate it remotely, and then rapidly move to another location, either to better engage a new target or avoid counterattacks. The heavily computerized nature of the system could make it readily adaptable to precision-guided mortar rounds in the future. The Army , along with the U.S. Marine Corps , is in the process of developing GPS- and laser-guided mortar bombs. General Dynamics Roll-Controlled Guided Mortar (RCGM) GPS-guided 81mm mortar round., General Dynamics These advantages don’t come cheap, unfortunately, and could explain why the ADIM remains largely a technology demonstration effort after nearly a decade. The Army first initiated the project in 2011 and has just the one prototype example. It had spent years before that experimenting with a weapon system known as Scorpion, consisting of a simpler Humvee-mounted Soviet-designed 2B9 Vasilek soft-recoil, semi-automatic mortar. That weapon feeds from four-round magazines and has a practical rate of fire of up to 180 rounds per minute. The last time the service appears to have requested money directly for ADIM, in its 2015 fiscal year budget proposal it asked more than $1.8 million for continued development and testing. To put this in context, in its latest request for the 2019 fiscal cycle, the Army wanted just less than $12.5 million in the base budget to pay for the continued procurement of dozens more 60mm, 81mm, and 120mm infantry mortar systems combined . The Army’s Scorpion system, a Humvee armed with the Soviet-designed 2B9 Vasilek., US Army via HMMWV In Scale In 2015, the Army acknowledged that the active-recoil system, in particular, had proven to be too costly in the past to make it practical for weapons, such as mortars, which are present in a large number of units. Though the service said the price point was coming down, there would still undoubtedly be increased sustainment costs associated with issuing ADIM and its computer-controlled firing mechanism on a wide-scale. The added complexity of mechanical soft-recoil systems has proven difficult enough to make worthwhile in the past. The Army worked to develop a combination 105mm and 155mm soft-recoil howitzers in the 1970s before canceling the project and made a second abortive attempt at a similar system in the 1990s. The video below describes the Army’s Cold War-era XM204 howitzer effort. https://youtube.com/watch?v=NWB8FrL-WCo There is the possibility that the research and development into soft- and active-recoil could apply to larger weapons, which might help spread the burden of certain costs. The Army is very interested in finding ways to squeeze additional range out of its existing 155mm howitzers and replace its 105mm types with an overall more capable system that is still lightweight . Another option might be to pitch ADIM, or a derivative of the system, as a more effective, mobile fire support system for defending remote operating bases, which was one of the project’s original goals. Special operations forces are already employing a more traditional computer-assisted, fixed emplacement 120mm mortar system in combat with support from the Army logistics chain. The business end of the ADIM weapon system., US Army The Army could look to bring in other services, as well. The Marine Corps recently retired its towed 120mm mortars and is looking for new lightweight fire support systems that are still mobile enough to keep up with its expeditionary operational concepts. There’s no doubt the new mortar offers impressive performance, but after almost 10 years of research and development, it’s not clear whether it will be able to succeed where similar past efforts have failed.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Sep 20, 2018",Lockheed Is Already Pushing A Stealthy Version Of Its MQ-25 Stingray Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Well that didn’t take long! Just weeks after unveiling their entrant into the MQ-25 carrier-based tanker competition, Lockheed is already dangling the possibility of weapons carrying upgrades and a low observable variant of the flying-wing drone. A very glitzy video produced by the company was released for the Sea Air Space exhibition that just concluded in Maryland. The animation shows the aircraft in action, and towards the end, an MQ-25 is seen loaded with Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOWs) instead of a refueling pod and an external fuel tank. The title above reads: “Future Mission Flexibility-Strike.” Then, at the culmination of the video, the MQ-25 morphs in color from light-gray to dark gray, and all the aerials and antennas that are scattered around the drone disappear. Clearly, the Skunk Works is hinting at a future low-observable out-growth variant of its MQ-25 design. And the title above points to that possibility as well, reading: “Future Mission Flexibility-Survivability.” Lockheed Martin The video also shows off a couple new features found on Lockheed’s MQ-25, like how it has a retractable electro-optical sensor turret under its left wing. Video Screencap It also has some pretty cool air brakes that conform to its conical center section. Video Screencap Maybe most interesting of all, we get a better idea of how the MQ-25 will move around the deck. It appears that its path will be monitored from the aircraft’s desktop-style ground control station via a set of wide-angle video cameras. The aircraft itself will communicate its intent to those on the deck via a set of LED lights on its nose and nosegear doors that display different colored symbols based on what it’s doing, or possibly, what it wants to do. Pretty cool really! The MQ-25 is supposed to be semi-autonomous, so there is no man-in-the-loop flying the aircraft in a traditional sense. It’s not clear if hand motion recognition software will be used to direct the bat-winged drone into position on the carrier or if its controller will direct it using a point-and-click interface or some other command concept. Video Screencap Video Screencap You can watch the video in full here: The possibility of a low-observable derivative of Lockheed’s Stingray isn’t surprising based on the aircraft’s basic design, the company’s past flying-wing endeavors , and the Skunk Works’ long history with stealth , but it runs counter to Lockheed’s recent claims. Aviation Week’s James Drew was given the opportunity to unveil the exotic drone tanker’s design to the world in a large feature that we wrote an extensive blog about . In it, Drew interviews Lockheed’s MQ-25 program manager John Vinson, in which he states: “There’s no credit given for stealth. We’ve gone with the flying-wing design for efficient operation,” Vinson explains. “Most tankers carry fuel in the wing to distribute the weight of the fuel with the lift of the wing, and since that is what the majority of the payload is, we’re doing an all-wing design.” If the jet can become a low observable asset by adding coatings, concealing antennas, and making other small tweaks, then it seems the Skunk Works team did, in fact, have stealth in mind when designing their MQ-25. Boeing’s MQ-25 prototype came straight from the now-defunct Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program that had low-observability requirements and could also be returned to its harder to detect configuration in the future with similar modifications. Keep in mind we are not talking about very low observable, deep penetrating stealth aircraft here, but ones with enhanced survivability that can operate along the fringes of contested airspace and even directly inside threat environments that don’t feature advanced and dense integrated air defense systems. General Atomics design, on the other hand, is unlikely to be able to be reconfigured into a low-observable platform. But at the same time, it may be able to carry more fuel than any other competitor—at least if the powerful engine it uses is any indication of its intended payload. This brings us back once again to the reality that all three competitors directly emanate from or are at least based in part on their now defunct UCLASS progenitors. Even Lockheed’s ‘clean-sheet design’ that supposedly gives no quarter to low-observability clearly has a strong relation in planform and configuration with their very stealthy Sea Ghost UCLASS design. And Sea Ghost was based directly on the very low observable RQ-170 Sentinel. Sea Ghost concept based on the RQ-170 Sentinel., Lockheed Martin The MQ-25 requirements have no mention of stealth, and that is at least partially the reason why Northrop Grumman, and its highly promising and proven X-47B demonstrators , dropped out of the competition. In retrospect, the Navy should have just prioritized the tanking requirement higher in the UCLASS competition. Then it would have ended up with a more competitive bidding process and a penetrating low-observable combat air vehicle that could also lug some gas around when needed. If it couldn’t meet the 14,000lbs of transferable fuel after flying 500 miles from the carrier requirement, just sortie an extra one to accomplish the task. In other words, by continuing with UCLASS but beefing up its tanking requirements a bit—tanker capability was part of that program as well—the Navy would have had a little less tanking capability per airframe, but they would also have ended up with an aircraft that could do so many other missions, some of which are very in demand and go completely unfulfilled within the Navy as a whole. Also, considering the Navy is now buying large lots of Super Hornets again—and with conformal fuel tanks—the need to offset the tanking mission from the Super Hornet community has decreased massively. Then again, if the Navy just bought the best navalized unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) available from any of the four manufacturers that were bidding on UCLASS, the service would have carrier-based tactical aircraft that could shatter the range of any manned asset by a multiple of two or three, and without any tanker support at all. So an MQ-25 tanker really wouldn’t even be necessary. But if the Navy still wanted an unmanned tanker, it could convert some of the 108 S-3 Vikings it already owns that are just sitting out in the desert into one. Then again, if a stealthy carrier-based UCAV wasn’t ‘strangled in its crib’ by the fighter-pilot dominated decision-making cadre in the Navy and the idiots in Congress, it would lead a lot of people to ask why an F-35C is needed if a drone that cost half to a quarter the price can do many of the same things but three times to four times farther away and without risking a pilot in the process. But instead of just embracing the future and fielding the best UCAV it could, the Navy is blowing its money on a tanker drone that it no longer needs that badly and that can maybe adapt to do some limited work in the semi-contested airspace. That is if the Navy will shell out to develop and field those upgraded variants. In the end, the decision deep six UCLASS and neuter the Navy’s unmanned carrier-based aircraft potential into the form of a flying gas can was laughably near-sighted and arguably disingenuous. Above all else, the decision to give the drone a job no fighter pilot wanted, one that was only needed in part because of the cancellation of UCLASS itself, protected the service’s manned fighter programs with ruthless abandon. And sadly, none of this is surprising.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A brief clip of an official video from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has appeared online, showing what looks to be a C-130 Hercules-type aircraft deploying or recovering a prototype unmanned system as part of the Gremlins drone swarm program. This is the first actual footage to emerge regarding the project, which is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of having groups of low-cost, air-launched, reusable drones perform a variety of roles. The clip is presently available through the public hosting service Giphy , but it is unclear how long it has been online. We first noticed it earlier in April 2018 after Twitter user @MIL_STD posted it along with a quote from Eric DeMarco, who is President and CEO of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions. Kratos, along with Dynetics, General Atomics, and Lockheed Martin, took part in the first phase of the Gremlins program , which ended in March 2017. DARPA subsequently awarded additional contracts to Dynetics and General Atomics, but Kratos continued to be involved in the project as a subcontractor to the former firm. “We have consistently demonstrated our success in rapidly designing and delivering low-cost, high-performance unmanned jet aircraft, and we see this as critical with respect to the Gremlins requirement,” DeMarco said in a press release in March 2017. “Our strategic focus is consistent with the Department of Defense’s Third Offset Strategy, which emphasizes the need to rapidly prototype innovative technologies to counter emerging threats and provide the United States with an asymmetric advantage over our adversaries.” Gremlins, which first began in August 2015 , envisions a cheap, short-life drone swarm that one or more aircraft can release in flight and another set of planes can then retrieve in mid-air after a mission. The basic concept of operations envisions a C-130-type aircraft – as seen in the video – as well as combat aircraft, such as fighter jets and bombers, releasing the swarm of Gremlins at a stand-off distance from enemy defenses. The drones would then conduct this missions and another C-130 would retrieve them and return to base with them, where ground crews would be able to have them ready for another sortie within 24 hours. The minimum threshold requirement is for the low-cost unmanned systems to remain functional for just 20 missions. An artist’s conception of Gremlins in heading out to a target area, while others return to a separate mothership., DARPA DARPA says the primary tasks it envisions for Gremlins, at least at present, are intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and as a platform for other “non-kinetic” payloads, which could include electronic warfare systems. This would make sense since swarms offer significant potential as distributed sensor nodes and as a means of overwhelming enemy integrated air defenses ahead of a strike. But this is just a small portion of the potential mission sets for swarms of small drones able to act autonomously or semi-autonomously, based on a fixed set of parameters and potentially in concert with other, larger unmanned or manned systems. As I wrote in a piece detailing Chinese swarm developments in January 2018: Future swarms of small drones might also be able to carry electronic warfare jammers , emitters that mimic the signals of larger aircraft , equipment capable of conducting cyber attacks , or other systems to confuse or overwhelm an opponent’s defenses ahead of or during a more complex operation. A swarm of drones with small electro-optical or infrared cameras might be able to rapidly search a broad area for targets of interest discreetly and, with miniaturized data links, feed this information to other aircraft or other assets where it can be fused and exploited, giving their friendly force a more complete view of the battlefield and any potential hazards or targets of opportunity. Even a swarm of small drones each with different modular capabilities installed could potentially conduct a broad array of tasks at once and in a resilient manner. Navigation system carrying types could help guide armed versions over long distances. Some armed variants could be capable of homing in on certain types of radiation—like radar emitters, air defense nodes, or even individual communications devices, while others can be capable of attacking prescribed targets that visually match images in their memory database. In this way, developments may be able to reduce the overall size and complexity of the basic underlying aircraft. This is an especially important consideration since the cost of launching dozens, or even hundreds of drones, could otherwise become prohibitive quite quickly, especially if the user doesn’t expect some or even all of them to necessarily survive. Systems that are ostensibly for scientific research purposes, but that have sensors designed to monitor visual or other changes across a wide area could easily have military applications, too, acting as early warning nets or helping guard borders. Drones swarms might even be able to eventually attack targets directly with small munitions or launch suicidal strikes against ground vehicles or ground-based elements of an integrated air defense system, such as radar arrays. When it comes to Gremlins in particular, a modular strike package of some sort, with a combination of sensors and a kinetic payload, could squeeze extra capability out of the aircraft on their last operational flights. The clip does not appear to show Kratos’ Gremlins prototype, though. A public affairs representative for DARPA confirmed that the clip was from an official video, but said that it had been released yet and declined to comment further. We do know that it is not General Atomics’ design. The company is, so far, the only one to publicly display its offering, which it simply calls the Small Unmanned Aerial System , or SUAS. The unmanned system in the DARPA video has a distinctly different and more bulbous planform with four fins at the rear. General Atomics’ SUAS only has two rear fins in a completely different arrangement. The rear fins on the vehicle in the animated picture have what appears to be of a grid or lattice design . This point towards Dynetics, which produces the GBU-69/B Small Glide Bomb , a precision-guided munition that has three fins of a similar shape. Kratos’ existing target and multi-purpose drone designs feature traditionally shaped control surfaces. The GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition., Dynetics In addition, the C-130 visible in the video appears to be one that belongs to International Air Response . This firm offers a variety of specialized air services, including making their aircraft available for flight tests, and is a member of Dynetics Gremlins team. Of course, grid fins are a well-established technology at this point and, among other benefits, offer a relatively easy way to fold control surfaces near flush against the cylindrical body of a missile, rocket, or other types of projectiles. This can help make the weapon or air vehicle more compact for storage and carriage before launch, which would almost certainly be an important consideration for the Gremlins project. The video itself is almost certainly from the first phase of the project, which was supposed to include tests to examine methods for both launching and recovering prototypes from the rear of a C-130-type aircraft. The clip appears to show a winch system with a physical tether to the drone, but it is not clear whether this is part of the launch or recovery process, or if that system performs both functions. Reeling the vehicle in either direction would be good test points. But while a tether could offer a low-cost means of releasing the unmanned systems, it might present greater difficulties in attempting to recover them and do so rapidly. It is possible that there is a secondary arm or another mechanism to quickly snag a returning aircraft that is not visible in the clip. General Atomics’ Gremlins’ concept art has depicted underwing pylons releasing drones via a fixed line, but with a more complex robotic arm for retrieving them afterward. Concept art showing a full-configured C-130 mothership for the Gremlins drones., General Atomics The complicated nature of this proposition is not entirely new. During the Cold War, the U.S. Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency employed the Fulton Recovery System , also known as the Skyhook, to catch the parachutes on falling film canisters from spy satellites and early reconnaissance drones in mid-air, as well as snatch up downed aviators, special operators, and secret agents right off the ground. This arrangement consisted of an aircraft with a large V-shaped frame at the front to snag the parachute or a line attached to a balloon. The object would then trail behind the aircraft, where personnel at the rear would use a separate line and winch to haul it aboard. The C-130 was the primary Fulton platform until the Air Force retired the system completely in 1996. Physical hooks that allow one aircraft to retrieve another are an even older concept, dating back to the 1930s with the U.S. Navy airship USS Akron . This massive dirigible could launch and release Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters from a large internal hangar. During the 1950s, the Air Force experimented with a number of air-launched and recovered aircraft schemes, both to provide fighter escort for long-range bombers and to extend the range of small reconnaissance aircraft. Modified B-29 Superfortress and B-36 Peacemaker actually flew experimentally carrying modified F-84 jet fighters and RF-84 reconnaissance aircraft, as well as the purpose-built XF-85 Goblin “parasite fighter.” In the 1970s, Boeing revived the concept, suggesting that it could convert 747 airliners into flying Airborne Aircraft Carriers (AAC). In addition to being able to launch and recover 10 “microfighters,” the modified airliner would’ve be able to refuel them in flight, at least in theory. So there is definitely a significant amount of existing history out there with launching and recovering aircraft in mid-air that Dynetics and General Atomics could tap into as they proceed with the Gremlins project. It will be fascinating to see what concepts they ultimately propose as the program moves forward. Boeing’s 747 AAC concept., Boeing via Boeing-747.com DARPA’s first phase also included studies to examine ways to keep the individual drones cheap and easy to modify in order to accept new systems as necessary. There was also work on developing digital flight control systems to enable the aircraft to work together as a swarm. The second phase, which began in 2017, is working toward maturing the experimental components into more functional prototypes for full-scale tests of a complete system. DARPA hopes that demonstration, phase three of the Gremlins program, will begin in 2019 . And though the agency said it couldn’t tell us anything more about the video, they did say there’s a new announcement about Gremlins coming soon. So it might not be long before we get more details about the project’s actual progress. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Drones"
Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 11, 2018","Trump To Putin: Get Ready, U.S. Missiles Are Coming. Also, Can We Make a Deal?","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. In response to the growing possibility of U.S. military action against Syria’s Bashar Al Assad, Russia’s Ambassador to Lebanon reiterated his country’s support for the dictator and said Russian forces would shoot down any incoming American missiles and potentially take retaliatory action . In response, U.S. President Donald Trump, in his trademark freewheeling and sometimes incoherent style, has now offered both a direct threat and an olive branch via his outlet of choice, Twitter. The two Tweets came within an hour of each other on April 11, 2018. Trump has never shied away from making bold threats of military or other action against foreign countries on social media, but his initial post may be the first in which he effectively promised imminent and tangible military action. Alexander Zasypkin, the Russian Ambassador to Lebanon, had made his own comments in an interview with Al Manar TV, an outlet the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah controls, late on April 10, 2018. “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,” the president wrote. “Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” It is unclear what types of missiles, if any, Trump might have been referring to specifically. There have been no public reports from any branch of the U.S. military about the induction into service of a “new” stand-off, land-attack missile since he took office in 2017. In addition, all such existing American weapons in this category can be broadly described as “smart,” which generally means they feature some sort of guidance system. And though it is likely that Syrian air defenders and their Russian partners would attempt to shoot down any incoming missiles, it’s unclear how successful they would necessarily be, especially against a barrage with dozens of weapons. On April 7, 2017, the U.S. Navy conducted a punitive strike against Assad, firing nearly 60 low-flying Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles at the Syrian Air Force’s Shayrat Air Base. The U.S. military could hope to overwhelm any defenses within Syria with a similar strike or combine it with low-observable aircraft, such as the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber or F-22 Raptor stealth fighter , or stealthy stand-off weapons, such as the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range, or JASSM-ER . The Kremlin does have S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems and their associated radars in the country, which reportedly have some capability against low-flying cruise missiles. In addition, Russia has deployed A-50U Mainstay radar planes to the country that reportedly has the ability to track those types of targets, which could help alert air defense personnel to incoming threats. However, Assad’s own forces have so far been unable to fully neutralize incoming Israeli attacks or successfully intercept all of their stand-off weapons. The Russians have not intervened in any of those instances , which might have revealed the extent of their added capabilities. But whatever the actual capacity of the integrated Syrian-Russian air defense network to brush off an American missile attack is, it is bizarre that Trump would decide to not only telegraph his intention to strike, but also clearly announce his intention to do so in the near future. As a private citizen, presidential candidate, and now President of the United States, he has repeatedly stated that the U.S. military should not publicly describe even the broadest timetables for action in order to maintain a “surprise” advantage. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and his team at the Pentagon have echoed this sentiment for more than a year now. “The department does not comment on potential future military actions. I refer you to the White House to characterize the President’s tweet,” Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement to Reuters on April 11, 2018. “As the President noted on April 8, the chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime against innocent civilians in Duma, Syria on April 7 was horrifying, and demands an immediate response from the international community.” Later that day, Secretary Mattis said that the United States was “still assessing the intelligence” regarding the Douma incident, appearing to walk back the President’s comments, in comments to the press around a scheduled meeting with Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld. “We stand ready to provide military options if they’re appropriate as the President determined,” SecDef Mattis added, further clouding the issue. Beyond the brazenness of using social media to inform the Russians of an apparently impending missile strike in Syria, Trump further confused the matter by almost immediately suggesting that there could also be a negotiated solution. A second Tweet seemed to offer a rollback of American sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses in exchange for unspecified concessions. On April 6, 2018, the Treasury Department unveiled a massive new package of economic restrictions that hit more than half dozen Russian oligarchs, a dozen companies they own, nearly 20 Russian government officials, the Kremlin’s state arms broker Rosoboroneksport, and a bank in Russia. “Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this,” Trump declared. “Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?” The Russian government has already responded to the president’s latest comments, with Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that the United States should save its “smart missiles” for “terrorists, not the legitimate [Syria] government.” She went on to suggest that an American strike on Assad could destroy evidence of the horrific Syrian government chemical weapon attack on Douma – which Russia denies occurred – before offering up yet another completely unfounded conspiracy theory that the U.S. military’s plans were part of a deliberate effort to conceal the truth of that incident. Iranian authorities, Assad’s other principle benefactor, have also announced their intention to stand by the Syrian government against “ foreign aggression .” The Syrian dictator himself remains defiant and Russian state-run media outlet Sputnik has insisted that he remains in the country with his family. But if the United States already seemed to be stumbling closer to some sort of military action against the Syrian regime in order to make good on previous threats, Trump has now created even more of a rhetorical trap that will make it difficult not to act without embarrassing him or his Administration as a whole. If there is any truth to the Tweet, we could be seeing how all this plays out in real time within days, or even hours. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor"
Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Apr 11, 2018",If The U.S. Attacks Syria Here’s How Russia Could Retaliate Militarily,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just days after the gas attack on Douma , and as the U.S.-Russia relationship careens into the most tumultuous diplomatic period since the end of the Cold War, the internet is buzzing with all sorts of military-related claims. These include rumors of assets being discreetly moved towards Syria, aircraft carrying out specialized patrols over and near the country, and other more outlandish claims many of which have laughably bad sourcing if any at all. Still, it seems very likely that we are on the precipice of a U.S.-led military action against the Assad regime in Syria, and Russia has sworn time and again that they would respond in kind to such an act. But what would that look like? How could Russia act tough while still not near-instantly inciting World War III? What we think is the answer to that question is probably not what you have been hearing. This article is not about gaming out Russia’s decision cycle after a substantial U.S. attack occurs. There is a good chance Russia could do nothing at all militarily. Instead, it could choose to do something totally asymmetric like a cyber attack or some large-scale show of force. It could even do nothing at all. But for the purpose of this exercise, we are assuming Russia will act swiftly in a military manner, so let’s put the debate as to why aside. Currently, talk of a Russian reprisal has almost totally stayed within the naval realm. It seems to be all but assumed that the U.S. will launch another Tomahawk cruise missile barrage from the Eastern Mediterranean at targets in Syria. This is likely accurate, but this time around a more diverse set of assets are likely to be used in addition to Tomahawks, such as B-2 bombers, F-22 Raptors and other standoff munitions. Regardless of what is used, the train of thought is that Russia will return fire on the launching vessel or vessels by executing an anti-ship missile attack. There have even postings of Flanker derivatives supposedly prowling over Tartus, Syria carrying Kh-35 anti-ship missiles to support this idea. Of course, there is no way to corroborate the authenticity of these images. But would Russia really try and sink an American warship with hundreds of sailors on board in response to an attack on a relatively weak allied foreign power that is being accused of launching a gas attack on its own people? Very unlikely. Doing so would also instantly open up the naval domain as a battleground, which is not an attractive reality for the Russian Navy. The overall repercussions of such a move would be far too severe, and in the end Russia just cares that Assad stays in power. As long as he survives it is simply a matter of showing that Moscow’s threats are tangible, not avenging the gallant spirit of the Assad regime. Instead, Russia is more likely to contain the conflict within Syrian borders by launching a series of highly targeted standoff attacks on American interests and installations in Eastern Syria. Namely, those that support non-Kurdish militias that are also vehemently anti-Assad, such as the Syrian Arab Coalition. The staging and training base near the town of At Tanf, located near the nexus of the Jordanian, Iraqi, and Syrian borders, would be an especially attractive target. Approximate location of at Tanf. , Google The base has already been attacked by Russia in the past in a mysterious multi-wave aerial assault that occurred in June of 2016. Iranian-backed Assad loyalist fighters attempted attacks on the base on no less than two occasions a year later. Two advanced Iranian drones were also shot down near the base by F-15E fighters during those offensives. So the base has already been openly contested by forces loyal to Assad. Similar operating locations are also scattered as far north as al Raqqa and as far east as Deir ez-Zor. Once again, going after these targets would allow the Russians to target American interests in the country without killing U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, which Russia also has an ongoing relationship with. Yet even that relationship has made a major turn for the worse in recent months. As for the possibility that Americans could die in those strikes, Russia can say the same for American strikes on Assad’s military capabilities and installations. Giving the U.S. a warning may be possible on very short notice but it could decrease the chances of their cruise missiles actually making it to their targets intact. But even if U.S. special operations personnel vacate those locales in advance of a Russian attack, destroying the infrastructure at the forward outposts, albeit already quite austere, can be claimed as a win by Moscow. Russia already has a significant number of options for which it could execute a stand-off attack already positioned in the region. Sending aircraft to do the job would result in major losses of Russian tactical aircraft at the hands of American fighters, including F-22 Raptors, which persistently prowl the airspace. Within Syria proper, it has Bastion-P coastal defense systems, each of which includes a number of wheeled transport-erector-launchers with two P-800 Oniks missiles. Officially a supersonic, sea-skimming anti-ship missile, in November 2016, Russian forces in Syria demonstrated that the weapon had a secondary land-attack capability. It remains unclear how accurate these weapons are in this role given that they traditionally use radar to home in on their target in the final stages of flight and that system is geared toward searching for and locking onto ships in a maritime environment. At the same time, the missiles could rely on their inertial navigation systems with the help of GLONASS to strike a set of coordinates on a map. https://youtube.com/watch?v=qsXIALWlb5M More likely, the Kremlin would turn to sea- and air-launched cruise missiles. Right now, the Russian Navy’s Admiral Grigorovich -class frigate Admiral Essen , which can carry up to eight Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles, is in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea within striking distance of Syria. Another Admiral Grigorovich -class ship is nearby in the Red Sea and could readily move into position. Russia has a number of submarines that can fire Kalibr missiles, as well, and may be operating in the Mediterranean. In late 2017, two Improved Kilo -class boats entered the area, both of which carry those cruise missiles , and the Black Sea Feet’s Kilo -class boats are now a fixture in the area. By striking from the Mediterranean, the Russians would be able to avoid having to secure permission to send those missiles flying over third-party countries. Otherwise, they would have to do so without that authorization and risk the consequences of possibly provoking diplomatic protests, or worse if one of the weapons fails and crashes inside one of those countries. In 2015, ships from the Russian Navy’s Caspian Sea Flotilla fired Kalibrs into Syria , but some of them came down inside Iran . Warships firing those weapons from inside the Black Sea would have to shoot the weapons over Turkey, while launches from the Red Sea would have to cross Saudi Arabia, and possibly Jordan, the latter being an especially staunch American ally, to get to Syria. Another option would be to send long-range bombers, potentially including Tu-22M3 Backfires, Tu-160M White Swans, and Tu-95M Bears, carrying Kh-55 and Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles over the Mediterranean to launch those weapons. The Kremlin has already used these aircraft, flying from bases within Russia, in the past for stand-off attacks on targets in Syria. But in this case, countries may balk at providing overflight rights to those bombers considering they may be on their way to strike American targets. Also, using bombers would give the U.S. a big heads up as to what is likely to come—but then again that could be Moscow’s intent. There is even the possibility that the Russians could take the opportunity to demonstrate an all-new capability. Russia’s Air Force claims that it has fielded the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, which appears to be an air-launched version of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, with MiG-31 interceptor units in the country’s Southern Military District. These aircraft, which are intended for long-range operations, would almost certainly be able to strike targets in Syria from those bases with the Kinzhal. It’s not clear, however, whether the Kremlin would be willing to commit a weapon to combat for the first time in this instance and we don’t know if the system has a conventional warhead option. The Russians have been using the Syrian battlefield as a proving ground for their newest weapons for years, but they have employed them only against anti-regime rebels and ISIS where the stakes are lower. They would likely favor more proven systems in any attack that could lead to the deaths of American troops, whether the goal is to avoid those casualties or cause them. The Kremlin could also decide to avoid directly striking back itself, offering tacit support to the Syrian government or Iran and its proxies to go ahead with their own stand-off attacks. Iran has already demonstrated its ability to fire ballistic missiles from its own territory at targets within Syria and has been actively helping Assad with his own ballistic missile program. The Syrian military has used its own short-range Scud-type ballistic missiles in the Civil War, but it’s unclear how many it has left after nearly a decade of fighting or what condition the remaining examples might be in at this point. Those missiles are also vulnerable to preemptive strike as they fuel in an erect position, and Assad mobilizing those missiles would be just the type of operation the U.S. would undoubtedly be looking for through its intelligence channels following a punitive set of strikes. For Iran, though, the calculus could be more complicated as it is seeking to gain a greater foothold in Syria while at the same time weathering increasing Israeli strikes, including a recent attack on Syria’s T4 air base earlier just two days ago. The threshold for American and Israeli escalation against Iranian targets inside and out of the country would be far lower than it would be in response to a Russian attack and would put Iran at greater risk as a result. The same is even truer when it comes to the Syrian government, which exists in no small part at the whim of Russian support and still comes under regular Israeli attack. All of this together means that the Russians remain the best positioned and capable of retaliating against any American-led action with strikes in kind within Syria. Keep in mind that this is just our best guess as to how such a reactionary operation would take place. Once again, Russia could do nothing at all or something within a completely different domain of warfare. But considering Moscow’s persistent statements that a U.S. attack on Assad or his forces would result in a similar counterattack by Russian forces, the scenario we laid out above seems the most likely. Of course, the fact that we are even writing this post is downright terrifying, and the biggest question is what comes after such a tit-for-tat exchange occurs? Simply put, the two Cold War-era foes have not come this close to exchanging blows in decades, and somehow it all seems so nonchalant. And that is the most troubling part of all.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Russians Are Jamming US Drones in Syria Because They Have Every Reason To Be,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. military has reportedly seen a spike in Russian forces in Syria jamming the GPS receivers and other data links on its small unmanned aircraft flying over the country. But it’s unclear whether this reflects any significant change in Russia’s overall strategy amid evidence that the Kremlin has been harassing American aircraft over the country in this way to some degree for years, which The War Zone was among the first to reveal . On April 10, 2018, NBC News , citing anonymous U.S. government sources, reported that Russia had been launching electronic warfare attacks against unspecified American unmanned planes for weeks. This increased activity came after a series of indiscriminate Syrian government poison gas attacks on rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital Damascus. Those atrocities culminated in a strike on April 7, 2018 that left dozens dead and hundreds injured, which has prompted the United States and its allies to threaten some form of retaliation . The unnamed officials told NBC that the jamming was having an “operational impact” and that the Russian equipment was sophisticated enough to break through a number of existing countermeasures, including some jamming-resistant components . “The U.S. military maintains sufficient countermeasures and protections to ensure the safety of our manned and unmanned aircraft, our forces and the missions they support,” Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said in response to the outlet’s request for additional information, refusing to confirm or deny the reports. Though we don’t know what type of U.S. military drones the Russians have been targeting, from the available description these sound like catapult- and hand-launched unmanned aircraft that American special operators , and supporting conventional forces , are almost certainly using in Syria for short-range surveillance missions. These typically carry electro-optical video cameras, but some, such as the AeroVironment RQ-20A Puma and the Boeing Insitu MQ-27A ScanEagle can carry infrared optics and miniaturized signals intelligence equipment. A Boeing Insitu ScanEagle sits on its catapult., US Navy But Russia’s capabilities to jam and intercept video feeds from this category of drones are well established at this point. The country has a wide array of man-portable and vehicle-mounted electronic warfare systems that are reportedly capable of jamming transmissions and also feeding false information into networks, including “ spoofing ” GPS signals and potentially sending parties and vehicles off their intended course. There have been reports of such activity in Ukraine, where the Kremlin is actively supporting an insurgency against the government in Kiev, since 2014. In December 2016, it emerged that Ukraine’s forces were especially disappointed in hand-launched RQ-11B Raven drones they had received from the United States. Russian troops, and the separatists they supported, knocked down those drones with electronic warfare assets and downloaded video footage, which showed the layout and location of Ukrainian positions. The video below shows Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine showing off a captured RQ-11B Raven drone that they claimed to have brought down using an electronic warfare attack. In Syria specifically, there have been increasing indications that the U.S. military is concerned broadly about the potential for GPS jamming or other disruptions with the navigational network. The War Zone was first to report that at least one weekly U.S. Air Force intelligence summary in 2016, which we obtained in a heavily redacted form via the Freedom of Information Act, included an entire section devoted to the issue. More recently, we were first to report that the U.S. Army was adding anti-jam equipment to a fleet of discreet special operations spy planes in response to operational requirements. Three of these planes had been flying over Iraq as of 2016 – one crashed outside Erbil , the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region that year, due to engine failure – and may now be conducting operations over Eastern Syria. A portion of the table of contents from a US Air Force Combined Intelligence Fusion Center’s (CIFC) weekly intelligence summary for air operations over Iraq and Syria covering the period from Dec. 1 to 7, 2016., USAF via FOIA The Russians themselves have made no secret that they have deployed these assets to the country, either. After an unprecedented mass rebel drone attack on its Khmeimim air base and naval outpost in Tartus, both in western Syria, in January 2018, the Kremlin said that it had been able to neutralize some of the unmanned attackers using electronic warfare systems . It’s worth noting that both nation state military forces and non-state actors are steadily expanding their use of small drones, including in small groups and semi-autonomous swarms . As such, Russia is hardly alone in developing countermeasures against those types of unmanned aircraft. And it’s hard to imagine that Russia would not take advantage of this capability in its larger effort to impede American activities in Eastern Syria, which is staunchly opposes. Jamming the short-range drones limits the ability American troops to gain a better understanding of the situation around them, which can in turn only hamper their mission planning process and increase risks for them during more extended operations. Jamming would also be a way to help keep U.S. unmanned aircraft out of Western Syria, where Assad’s regime is more firmly in control and where his forces continue to commit crimes against humanity with impunity. Still, manned aircraft from the American-led coalition fighting ISIS long ago stopped flying in that part of the country and the dubious de-confliction line Russia and the United States have agreed to in order to separate their operations should preclude any drones from missions there, as well. A Russian Leer-2 electronic warfare system, based on the Tigr 4×4 light armored vehicle, which is one of the smaller known systems in service at present., Sputnik/Vladimir Astapkovich In addition, the Russian government has already shown it is willing to commit nebulous proxy forces to direct combat against U.S. personnel and their local Syrian partners. Those mercenary groups proved to be disastrously ineffective against American firepower in an incident in February 2018, which may have forced the Kremlin to reassess the utility of attempting to rely on these groups for any high-end fighting. Jamming the linkages between a drone and its controllers on the ground is also a relatively low-risk proposition for Russia. If it succeeds in destroying the aircraft it is unlikely that an American service member will die in the process, reducing the likelihood of any immediate escalation. The largely opaque relationship actual Russian troops in the country have with private military contractors, militias aligned with Assad, Iranian personnel , and Syrian government forces give the Kremlin significant avenues to deny any responsibility whatsoever. Russia’s Krasukha electronic warfare systems are some of the country’s most powerful. Supposedly they can jam all sorts of systems at long-range, from AWACS to drones, and even possibly satellites. , Vitaly V. Kuzmin But while Russia’s GPS jamming and spoofing in Syria is definitely a cause for concern , especially given the steadily worsening ties between the Kremlin and the U.S. government, the full extent of Russian capabilities in this regard in the country and whether there has been any actual shift in policy remain unclear. The sources told NBC News that larger unmanned aircraft, such as MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators , remained unaffected, which might be an indication that the electronic warfare attacks had been relatively localized and not complex enough to jam those drones’ microwave satellite communications data links. This would make sense given the increasingly close proximity of American and Russian-backed forces in Syria. U.S. forces throughout the country have been taking up more robust postures with added defenses in recent months in response to threats from various groups . US personnel offload cargo from a US Air Force C-130J-30 at an undisclosed location in Syria in February 2018., USAF It also potentially points to the use of more discreet and shorter-range systems that are easier to conceal. This would also help Russia deflect accusations that it is actively targeting U.S. troops in any way. Beyond that, there’s nothing to automatically indicate that the electronic warfare systems the Russians are using in Syria could ward off any larger air and missile strikes the U.S. military or its allies might launch against Assad in response to his chemical weapons attacks, at least not by themselves. Those assets could be worrisome within the context of the larger integrated Russian-Syrian air defense network , but it’s hardly a risk the U.S. government could be unaware of at this point. The U.S. military is aware of the potential difficulties of operating in a GPS degraded or outright denied environment, too, and is increasingly training to mitigate those dangers. A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth fighter pulls away from an aerial refueling tanker over Syria in March 2018. These jets have been a near constant feature in the region for years now and low-observable aircraft would almost certainly spearhead any future attack against Assad due to possible concerns about his air defenses, which are linked with Russian assets in the country., USAF The truth is, as we at The War Zone have been noting for months , that there is something of a low-level fight between Russia and the United States in Syria already, as well as elsewhere in the world . It’s a hybrid conflict that involves the heavy use of proxy forces and information warfare to create conflicting narratives about what’s actually happening on the ground. Jamming and otherwise harassing small U.S. drones remotely, as well as potentially reducing confidence in GPS-enabled systems, is entirely in line with this over-arching concept of operations. From everything we know, it’s been happening and will likely to continue happening, at least sporadically, for the foreseeable future as the Kremlin continues to agitate for a complete withdrawal of American forces from Syria.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 14, 2018",There Is A Crisis In US Military Aviation Whether Mattis And The Pentagon Admit It Or Not,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A string of U.S. military aircraft accidents have already left nearly 20 service members dead in 2018, but it appears Pentagon- and service-wide policies are preventing officials from openly discussing the possibility of larger, systemic problems. Ostensibly aimed at preventing potential enemies from believing the United States is not ready for a fight, these over-arching guidelines do little for operational security, make it difficult for the public to hold anyone accountable, and directly contradict years of U.S. government officials warning that funding cuts and a lack of a formal budget would likely produce exactly this situation. According to Task & Purpose , U.S. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, then chief of the Pentagon public affairs office, sent out an Email ordering subordinates to limit how much information they disclosed regarding U.S. military readiness. The underlying assumption seems to be that too much talk about how ready the U.S. military is or isn’t for contingencies and crises can only embolden America’s enemies. There is no indication that this guidance, which came straight from Secretary of Defense James Mattis, has changed since then. “While it can be tempting during budget season to publicly highlight readiness problems, we have to remember that our adversaries watch the news too,” Davis wrote, Task & Purpose reported after obtaining a copy of the missive. “Communicating that we are broken or not ready to fight invites miscalculation.” To be sure potential adversaries regularly comb open sources for any useful information, just as the U.S. military does in return, and operational security exists for a reason. At the same time, the U.S. has used classifications and other appeals to security excessively to keep various types of information concealed for a host of reasons and often applies those labels with an especially broad brush even when it’s unnecessary or counterproductive . F-16s assigned to the United States Air Force Flight Demonstration Team, also known as the Thunderbirds. On April 4, 2018, one of the organization’s jets crashed, killing the pilot. The unit has now canceled two future performances ., USAF But unless the U.S. military intends to stop disclosing aviation accidents entirely, as well as entire units or certain types of aircraft ending up grounded for safety reasons, then opponents already have a wealth of information to work within deducing the readiness and availability rates of certain types for themselves. Class A mishaps , defined as when someone dies or ends up permanently disabled or an accident causes more than $2 million in damages, almost always get reported right when they occur and are difficult to conceal even in the most highly classified situations regardless. Anyone with an internet connection can go to the websites of the Air Force Safety Center , the Army Combat Readiness Center , and the Naval Safety Center and get various accident statistics and other details at their leisure. It doesn’t take much effort to see possible negative trends. On April 6, 2018, a U.S. Army AH-64E Apache helicopter gunship belonging to the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade crashed near Fort Campbell, Kentucky, killing both crew members on board. These individuals were the six and seventh to die in U.S. military aviation accidents in a space of approximately 96 hours. AH-64D Apaches assigned to the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade during a training exercise in 2014. A similar AH-64E from the brigade crashed on April 6, 2018, killing the pilot and co-pilot., US Army Members of the press had already begun to question the Pentagon about whether there was some sort systemic issue emerging, as it turned out to be the case with a recent and equally deadly spate of Navy ship accidents . Any potential opponent is almost certainly wondering the same thing, and checking it against other intelligence they might have, but American officials insist on being coy about this possibility. A day before the Apache went down, U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff within the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered this almost laughably absurd exchange with a reporter during a regular press conference at the Pentagon: Reporter:  “Can you explain this wave of crashes this very week? Does the U.S. military have a crisis when it comes to U.S. military aviation?” McKenzie:  “So I would reject ‘wave’ and ‘crisis.’ Those are mishaps that occurred. We’re going to look at each one in turn. Each one is tragic. We regret each one. We’ll look at them carefully. I’m certainly not prepared to say that it’s a wave of mishaps or some form of crisis. No, I’m not prepared to say that.” Reporter:  “Can you explain it then? If it’s not a wave and it’s not a crisis, how do you explain it, General?” McKenzie:  ‘I’d say mishaps happen in military aviation any time you’re flying complicated machines in – in situations where you’ve got less than total visibility and doing things that are difficult to do. Mishaps are inevitably going to occur. We don’t want any mishaps to occur.  One mishap is too many. But I’m not prepared to say right now that this is some kind of crisis.” Of course to err is human and aviation accidents happen, but these are truisms that ignore what otherwise appears to be a decidedly abnormal series of events. The U.S. military aircraft mishaps that have already occurred in 2018 would also seem to continue a worrisome trend from the previous year, in which more than 30 aviators died and more were injured across nearly a dozen separate incidents. “It’s never normal when servicemen and women lose their lives. And I think that’s a tremendous tragedy. So, certainly, that’s not normal,” Lieutenant General McKenzie finally said near the end of the press briefing in something of a concession. Of course, this also explicitly contradicted his earlier assertion that deadly accidents are entirely normal and it is bizarre to suggest that service members dying on duty for any reason is somehow inherently unusual. U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, right, and chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana White, give a press briefing on April 5, 2018., DOD capture With little actual security benefit, these rhetorical gymnastics mainly serve to make it more difficult for the public, and their elected representatives, to hold anyone accountable and get things fixed. It also further deflects from the need to have serious discussions about whether continuing to conduct a global fight against terrorists and other militants is at all sustainable in its current form. “Readiness issues such as deferred maintenance, overuse of our troops and equipment, and insufficient investment end up costing us more in the long term,” Ruben Gallego, a Democrat Representative from Arizona and a Marine veteran, told Task & Purpose in an interview. “Such problems can also cost the lives of our service members, as we have seen recently with multiple ship crashes in the Pacific. These problems need to be addressed urgently by the Defense Department and Congress.” All of this might be slightly less galling if the Pentagon itself, and Mattis particularly since taking over as Secretary of Defense, hadn’t spent the better part of the last decade ringing alarm bells at every possible occasion that there was a danger of this occurring as result of the 2011 Budget Control Act . That law imposed automatic spending caps, which in turn prompted cuts, as part of a process commonly known as sequestration. The continuing inability of Congress to pass a formal annual budget has only made the situation worse, making it difficult for the U.S. military to conduct serious long-term planning and properly arrange its spending priorities. U.S. government officials and lawmakers repeatedly pointed out the devastating impact this would and was having on readiness, including the safety and availability of military aircraft fleets. A US Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier. The pilot of one of these survived a crash of one of these in the East African country of Djibouti on April 3, 2018, but that incident, plus another accident involving a CH-53E Super Stallion, forced the cancellation of a major US-led multi-national training exercise. , USMC To be certain, poor decision making on the part of many of the services further exacerbated these issues. New weapon systems repeatedly took precedence over readiness issues, including routine training, preventive maintenance, and supporting the logistics chain for existing equipment. By 2016, for example, this deliberate neglect prevented the Marines from flying more than 30 percent of their CH-53 heavy lift helicopters – one of which crashed earlier in April 2018, killing four Marines – at any one time. All of these factors have contributed to produce obviously troubling results. MilitaryTimes recently conducted an in-depth review of thousands of publicly reported U.S. military aviation mishaps, which showed a 40 percent increase in annual accidents across the services between the 2013 fiscal year, when sequestration kicked in, and the 2017 fiscal cycle, which ended on Sept. 30, 2017. We at The War Zone reviewed the outlet’s new database and found that a number of publicly known incidents, including the crash of an Army-owned Beechcraft King Air spy plane in Iraq in 2016 and an EO-5C surveillance aircraft that ran off a taxiway at Biggs Army Airfield in Texas in 2017, are still missing, suggesting that this figure could actually be higher. We also know from public statements that the overall availability of certain types of aircraft has slipped to atrocious levels. In November 2017, the Marine Corps disclosed to Congress that the availability rate for their CH-53s was still under 40 percent . Earlier in 2017, it became public that more than 60 percent of all Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets were unusable on any given day. Those are just some of the more egregious examples of the often worrisome general state of American military aviation. That doesn’t begin to touch on growing reports of hypoxia-like symptoms among fliers of various aircraft types across the services and other apparent freak accidents that can only shake military aviators’ confidence in the actual status of officially mission-capable aircraft. A US Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion. One of these helicopters went down on April 4 and the four Marines on board perished in the accident., USMC And despite Mattis’ own apparent desire to avoid telegraphing weakness to potential enemies, he has not shied away from making his own foreboding declarations about U.S. military readiness. In fact, America’s top military official has done quite the opposite, continuing to use the language of crisis to push for additional defense spending. “As hard as the last 16 years have been, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act, defense spending cuts and operating in nine of the last 10 years under continuing resolutions,” Mattis said in January 2018 during a talk at The Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced and International Studies. “Today, as our competitive edge over our foes erodes due to budgetary confusion, even with storm clouds gathering, America’s military, as I speak, is operating under yet another continuing resolution.” The contradictions are readily apparent and difficult to see how the conflicting statements don’t potentially embolden hostile actors just as much as admitting there are significant problems in need of fixing. And yet the Pentagon seems to believe that by not acknowledging the reality, they’ll create something of a Schrödinger’s readiness level, whereby the U.S. military inside the figurative box is both perfectly able to “ fight tonight ” and at the same time is always one budget cut away from collapse. The truth is almost certainly somewhere in the middle. In the meantime, when it comes to military aviation, it’s hard to judge whether the U.S. military as a whole is on a path to solving its issues, let alone the best one. The Air Force has announced a service-wide inquiry into aviation safety, but only into rising Class C mishaps , which result in damages between $50,000 and $499,000, a non-fatal injury that leads to a loss of work time, or both. In an interview with USNI News in April 2018, U.S. Marine Corps General Glenn Walters, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, acknowledged that the situation did strongly seem to point to a loss of readiness after years of near constant operations, but offered few details about what his service planned to do beyond trying to slow the pace of deployments and get new aircraft. Mattis, who many laud for his no-nonsense attitude, could do well with instituting policies that give the American people, their elected representatives, experts, and the free press, a frank picture of what’s going on and what needs to happen from here on out. At least then it would have a chance of actually getting fixed. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Air Air Forces U.S. Air Force"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 8, 2018",US-Russian Relations Entering Into Hyper-Volatile Period As Trump Mulls Syria Strike,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the gas attack on Douma , Syria, and overnight airstrikes launched by the Israeli Air Force, the diplomatic rhetoric between the United States and Russia has devolved into its most combative state since the end of the Cold War. In terms of volatility, it far exceeds that which followed Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014. With both sides having promises to keep, the two powers now appear to be on an incredibly dangerous course that could collide over the next hours or days. During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, Russia and the U.S. had at it in spectacular fashion. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley did not mince words when it came to Russia’ culpability in the gas attack on Douma over the weekend, stating in part : “The monster who was responsible for these attacks has no conscience… The Russian regime, whose hands are all covered in the blood of Syrian children, cannot be shamed by pictures of its victims. We’ve tried that before… Russia’s obstructionism will not continue to hold us hostage when we are confronted with an attack like this one… Russia and Iran have military advisers at the Assad regime’s airfields and operations centers. Russian officials are on the ground helping direct the regime’s ‘starve and surrender’ campaigns, and Iranian allied forces do much of the dirty work. When the Syrian military pummels civilians, they rely on the military hardware given by Russia. Russia could stop this senseless slaughter if it wanted. But it stands with the Assad regime and supports it without hesitation. The United States is determined to see the monster who dropped chemical weapons on the Syrian people held to account… We must not overlook Russia and Iran’s roles in enabling the Assad regime’s murderous destruction… We are beyond showing pictures of dead babies. History will record this as the moment when the Security Council either discharged its duty or demonstrated its utter and complete failure to protect the people of Syria… Either way, the United States will respond.” Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia fired back at the U.S. with dour rhetoric : “We are not particularly keen to be friends with you. We are not begging to be friends with you. What we want from you is really nothing, it’s something that is normal: civilized relations, which you arrogantly refuse, disregarding elementary, basic courtesy… And you are misguided if you think that you have friends… So-called friends of yours are only those who cannot say no to you, and, this is the sole criterion for friendship in your understanding. Russia has friends and unlike yourselves, we do not have adversaries. We do not view the world through that prism.” While a war of words was raging at the U.N., President Trump made the following remarks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, in which he made it clear he thinks he knows who is responsible and that there will be a high price to pay: After making his remarks, in a rare occurrence, the President took on Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that he too will pay a price for Russia’s involvement in the attack if that indeed is the case: It’s also worth noting that this is new White House National Security Advisor John Bolton’s first day on the job. Secretary of Defense James Mattis also noted to reporters that nothing has been ruled out as far as a response and that he is working with America’s allies on that front. He also called Russia out as well, saying: “The first thing we have to look at is why are chemical weapons still being used at all when Russia was the framework guarantor of removing all the chemical weapons.” Meanwhile, Russia has denied its involvement and that of the Syrian government in the gas attack and has repeated that it is being used as a pretext for military aggression against Assad’s regime and Russian interests in Syria. Russia also warned of major consequences if the U.S. executes a punitive set of strikes in Syria. Russia has repeatedly made statements at the highest levels of government that any U.S. attack on regime and Syrian military targets in the western part of the country would be met with counterattacks on U.S. interests in the region, as well as other ‘unintended consequences.’ Now, after meeting with his military and national security advisors, Trump seems to have decided on some sort of response to the gas attack. At the same time his demand to pull out of Syria in the near-term still stands, with one caveat: So what we are left with are the two foes with the world’s largest nuclear weapons stockpiles that have backed themselves into a corner via past statements and promises. And above all else, U.S. intelligence is certainly trying to handicap Moscow’s response based on a series of choices laid out to the President. For lack of a better term, a military operation aimed at Assad it tantamount to an extremely volatile game of geopolitical chicken. If the U.S. has indeed decided to act militarily in the short term, involving France and the United Kingdom, and possibly other countries, including Arab states to some degree, will help with keeping Russia’s response to any actions in check. But still, Russia’s Ministry of Defense has made it clear that they would retaliate militarily if Assad’s military capabilities were targeted and such a response could immediately strike up a skirmish that could escalate quickly far beyond Syrian borders. It’s worth noting under the current circumstances that today is the 15th anniversary of the statue of Saddam Hussein being torn down in Firdos Square during the regime-change military operation in that country widely known as Operation Iraqi Freedom. Saddam, like Assad, was also a horrific dictator who brutalized and even gassed his own people. But simply getting rid of a bad guy doesn’t necessarily mean you are saving lives or a country from devastation—quite the opposite really. Trump’s top national security aid still believes strongly that the Iraq war was a good thing and the right call to have made. Quite frankly, there isn’t really an opposing regime to the United States that John Bolton hasn’t wanted to change, at whatever the cost, over the last 15 years. This doesn’t mean that Trump would attempt a decapitation strike on Assad or try to topple him militarily in any way, but it is a stark reminder of the massive and unintended long-term consequences of America’s military actions overseas. And in Iraq the U.S. didn’t have Russia operating militarily and even basing its troops and hardware within that country and vowing to protect Saddam whatever the cost. In this case, Trump has to do something substantial militarily or nothing militarily at all. A pinprick missile attack like the one a year ago will be a laughable measure this time around and will mean next to nothing to a now far more powerful Assad. We have discussed this in depth multiple times before, but now that the President has basically painted himself into a corner when it comes to acting or not, he has to take away something dear to Assad if he decides to act militarily at all. Assad’s integrated air defense system is a particularly attractive target set because it will leave him vulnerable to wider follow-up strikes. The destruction of entire airfields and the aircraft based at them is another good option. Basically neutering his ability to wage air warfare would be a significant loss. The gas that was dropped on Douma was supposedly delivered via a barrel bomb out the back of a helicopter so this would be a relevant target set under the circumstances. Non-military regime targets are also attractive as well and could be paired with military targets to send a strong message. Another non-military avenue does exist, and it could be far more effective when it comes to realizing change in Syria than firing Tomahawks and dropping JDAMs. The sanctions just placed by the U.S. on Russian oligarchs with direct ties to the Kremlin have sent Russian markets into a free-fall. Russia’s RDX index dropped a whopping 11.5% and the MOEX index dropped 8.5% today as a result. The Ruble was also sent tumbling. The impact of such economic retreat hits Russia on all levels, including at the very top of the food chain, and can send its economy into a nosedive. This means Russia will have even fewer Rubles to pay for its over ambitious weapons development programs that it can’t already afford as well as its foreign policy excursions abroad. It will also put pressure on Putin at home to dial-back his foreign policy brinksmanship and to curtail his increasingly painful Syrian adventure . Assad has only kept himself in power because of Russia’s intervention into the Syrian civil war. Assad does what he is told by his Moscow masters. If Russia paid dearly economically for Assad’s maleficent acts, they are likely to stop. Going after the Kremlin’s pocketbook really shouldn’t be an option, it should happen regardless of if a military operation is paired with it or not. Now that the Trump administration is finally taking something akin to a harder line against Moscow, maybe such an action is possible. Regardless of what option or options the President chooses going forward in response to the gas attack in Douma, it seems as if tensions between Washington and Moscow are finally near the boiling point. Neither side is feigning friendship on any level anymore and the once bitter Cold War rivals seemed to have finally crossed the horizon into a much murkier standoff, one that has the real potential of going hot in some fashion or another within the next 48 hours.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 14, 2018",Air Strikes Targeting Syrian Military Sites Appear To Have Begun (Live Updating),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A day after The War Zone reported on a horrendous gas attack on Syrians in the rebel-held town of Douma, located on the eastern outskirts of the Syrian capital of Damascus, reports are flooding in of an air battle now occurring over the western part of the country. It appears that an attack on military targets associated with the Assad regime has begun, although what party is executing those strikes remains unclear. These reports come just hours after President Trump posted this tweet: Large explosions, sonic booms, and surface-to-air missile launches have been reported in western Syria, with even more reports pointing to a series of strikes concentrated on T4 (Tiyas) airbase in the Homs. This is the same base that Israel struck in retaliation to an Iranian-built drone violating Israeli airspace in February. The base is a primary operating site for the Syrian Air Force and Iran’s Quds Force and their proxies. Once again, we still can’t be certain that the U.S. is initiating these strikes at this time. Israel is another likely party and could be acting so that key hardware is not removed from Syrian sites before a U.S. strike occurs, or for other reasons unknown at this time. Even destroying Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities on their own accord makes sense for Israel. We are live updating this post minute-by-minute as more information comes available. Update: 7:17pm PST— Syrian state news reporting that there was indeed an attack on Tiyas Air Base. In addition, it says that Syrian air defense units engaged eight cruise missiles during the onslaught. U.S. officials are denying that this attack was by American forces. But sure would help if that runway was put out of action so the U.S. could wipe the base clean of its Su-24s and other combat aircraft. Update: 7:33pm PST— It’s also worth remembering that France has stated that it would also strike at regime-controlled targets if another gas attack occurred. We discussed this in a recent piece about the fighting in East Ghouta, stating: France has threatened to strike Assad’s forces if they do not de-escalate, and Russian claims the U.S. is gearing up to do the same, especially among accusations of continued use of chemical weapons by Assad on his own people. Russia says it will respond in kind against U.S. interests if Washington launches an attack. France has also warned its journalists to leave the country immediately and to not plan future trips. French President Emmanuel Macron stated the following on Friday: “The day we, particularly in tandem with our American partners, have irrefutable proof that the red line has been crossed—namely, through the use of chemical weapons to lethal—we will do what the Americans did more than a few months ago now; we would put ourselves in a position to proceed with targeted strikes.” Update: 7:38pm PST— ‘Matthew’ in our amazing comments section just pointed out this highly relevant tweet posted earlier today: U.S. continues to deny involvement in this set of strikes, which could be totally true. But we also have to remember that if indeed these strikes were launched by the U.S., especially by an American submarine in the Mediterranean, claiming them immediately could risk the security of that submarine until it can move away from the area. Other operational security issues also apply to certain aircraft and ship operations as well, especially considering Russian threats. Also, Israel could be happily doing the Pentagon’s work here to see some degree as the Israeli Defense Forces have basically identified T4 as a major Iranian forward operating location in Syria. Update: 7:52pm PST— Danny Makki has an interesting twitter thread going about the attack. We can’t confirm it at this time but it’s worth looking at . In it he states 20 missiles were fired at the base, eight of which were shot down. Drone facilities and maintenance facilities were targeted. Raid sirens sounded five minutes before the attack as the base was on high alert. It’s worth noting that advanced and even hard to detect drones would pose an additional threat to Israel if chemical weapons are available in the country. Update: 11:21pm PST— It’s somewhat amazing how little there is in terms of ‘big’ information to report over three hours since our last update. Multiple sources state 14 people died in the attack, including Iranian personnel operating out of the base. Israel still has not responded to inquiries about the strikes. Russia hasn’t commented on them yet either. I think it’s worth putting this up as it is interesting and does have to do with the web of geopolitical volatility currently surrounding chemical weapons, Syria, and Russia: I have been asked about American military movements in the vicinity of Syria in recent hours. Some of our good aircraft tracking friends have noticed a few things. Unsurprisingly, an RC-135 Rivet Joint is moving into the area likely to collect electronic intelligence on Syria. The Rivet Joint can gather communications intelligence as well as work to build-up a real-time electronic order of battle now that Syria’s air defense network, along with Russia’s air defense systems in the country, are on high alert. This information will be critical when it comes to building a mission plan to strike at targets in the country and is especially important for route planning for aircraft and/or cruise missiles. There are also multiple tankers working over the Mediterranean. KC-135s are somewhat common in the area, but KC-10s are less so: An emergency U.N. Security Council meeting is planned for tomorrow. At this point, a U.S. strike is unlikely to occur until after that meeting. Considering France is now likely to be involved in any operation, at least in some form ( SCALP EG and APACHE cruise missile attacks perhaps), and possibly other countries as well following the UNSC meeting, additional planning could take many hours or even a number of days. Update: 1:26am PST— Multiple outlets report that the Russian MoD has stated Israel executed the attack last evening on Syria’s Tiyas Air Base near Homs. According to Haaretz : “The Russian military said on Monday that two Israeli F-15 war planes had carried out strikes on a Syrian air base near Homs on Sunday, the Interfax news agency reported. Interfax cited the Russian Defense Ministry as saying the Israeli war planes had carried out the strikes from Lebanese air space. The Russian ministry said that Syrian air defense systems had shot down five of eight missiles fired, while the other three landed in the western part of the base.” Israel has weapons that are especially capable of highly precise standoff attacks, most notably Delilah air-launched cruise missiles . Update: 7:52am PST— Lebanon has officially confirmed multiple airspace breaches by Israeli aircraft overnight: Iran, which just lost multiple people at T-4 airfield, has declared the gas attack in Douma a conspiracy: Iran has formally named four of its personnel who died in the attack. Russia is also making the case that the gas attack was fabricated: As for the UK’s position on a potential response to the gas attack, apparently all options are on the table, at least after an investigation: “The Foreign Secretary underlined the urgent need to investigate what had happened in Douma and to ensure a strong and robust international response,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “They agreed that today’s meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York would be an important next step in determining the international response and that a full range of options should be on the table.” Although it is not a surprise, especially considering the confliction issues that could occur if the U.S. had struck at the same time, Israel appears to have given the U.S. notice of their intent to strike Syria prior to last night’s missile strike. Russia, on the other hand, claims it wasn’t alerted in advance, which would make sense considering the use of standoff weaponry. At the same time, some independent sources say that the Russians did know about the impending attack and left the base quietly without alerting the Iranians. A principals meeting of the White House National Security Council was held this morning which likely worked to further refine and update formal recommendations to President Trump as to how to respond to the gas attack. Update: 8:55pm PST— There is a lot of confusion on social media and other places online about the weapons Israel possibly used in the attack. The base may have been outside the range of Popeye missiles which pack a large warhead, but Delilahs , like their Popeye cousins, can fly into a hardened aircraft shelter before detonating via man-in-the-loop control. This pinpoint accuracy can give their much smaller warhead an advantage over missiles with much larger ones that don’t offer this sort of terminal guidance. Also, this was not a strike to decimate an airfield. It was a highly targeted attack likely focusing on Iran’s ability to generate drone sorties and to support its local activities in relation to Hezbollah. We don’t know what weapons were used for sure in this operation, but the biggest warhead is not always the best option, and in this case, range was an issue. An image prior to an IAF attack on Tiyas Air Base (T-4) in February. Note there is plenty of infrastructure that is not hardened to go after, most notably Iranian drone operations. But still, the Delilah cruise missile can literally fly inside hardened aircraft shelters or hit fortified structures at their most vulnerable points. , IDF As for what assets the U.S. could use already in the region for a series of near-term strikes—at least beyond forward-based tactical air power— USS Donald Cook , an Arleigh Burke class destroyer, has left Cyprus and is right there if the orders come. We don’t know exactly what is lurking under the water as well. As we have discussed at great length in the past, if another U.S. strike is launched against Assad’s military, it should be substantial enough that Assad loses something near and dear in the process. This can be a major military capability like large portions of his upgraded air defense network—which would leave him vulnerable to follow-on strikes—or entire airfields and the aircraft based there or even some of the regime’s ‘royal’ infrastructure. Tomahawk cruise missiles cannot accomplish some of these tasks and have especially limited abilities to destroy hardened infrastructure and runways. Update: 10am PST— Here are President Trump’s comments to the press on Syria: Secretary of Defense James Mattis has said he won’t rule anything out when it comes to action against Syria and added: “The first thing we have to look at is why are chemical weapons still being used at all when Russia was the framework guarantor of removing all the chemical weapons.” Here is SAMS’ updated tally of deaths it says were caused by the gas attack: Our coverage of this ongoing crisis can be found here going forward.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 26, 2018",Here’s Our First Good Look At The Crazy Air Inlet Design On Boeing’s MQ-25 Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Boeing has released a new highlight reel of its MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based tanker-drone. In it, the boat-tailed unmanned jet is seen undergoing ground handling tests , including connecting to a mock catapult. We also get some new concept footage of the aircraft in flight and refueling a Block III Super Hornet —another Boeing product. But what’s most interesting is that we get our first real glimpse of the aircraft’s exotic ‘flush’ air inlet design which has been the aircraft’s most puzzling feature since its unveiling in late December of 2017. As we have discussed before, like many of the features on Boeing’s MQ-25, its inlet design appears to be a carry-over from its stealthy Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) roots. Boeing’s prototype was originally finished in 2014 , before the UCLASS program was remodeled into a less complex tanker requirement under the Carrier Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) initiative. CBARS is now known as the MQ-25 Stingray program. It remains unclear exactly what modifications were made to the prototype’s airframe to adapt it to meet these new requirements. Boeing Video Screencap The intake design on Boeing’s MQ-25 seems to invite a number of potential airflow issues. Flush inlet designs like this are notoriously problematic, especially during flight at elevated angles of attack—such as when landing aboard an aircraft carrier. Boundary layer airflow can also be a major issue, and separating it from the fuselage to provide stable, high volume air to the engine throughout the aircraft’s flight envelope would seem to be highly problematic with such a design. You can read all about how critical and challenging jet aircraft air inlet designs can be, especially for low-observable combat aircraft, in this previous War Zone article . Just last week, Boeing announced that the engine used for their MQ-25 competitor is the Rolls Royce AE3007N—the same proven powerplant that is used on the RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-4C Triton. Yet those high-flying unmanned aircraft provide a much more generous air intake to provide airflow to their AE3007s than what Boeing has devised for their MQ-25. The intake design on the Triton and Global Hawk is a far more straight-forward and voluminous affair. It doesn’t even feature an S-shaped duct, instead the airflow travels directly to the engine along a continuous axis. , Northrop Grumman A variant of the 9,000lb thrust class engine is also used on the Citation X and the Embraer 145. It’s worth noting that General Atomics’ entrant into the MQ-25 contest will be powered by the Pratt and Whitney PW815 turbofan that will be configured to generate 16,000lbs of thrust. How exactly Boeing intends on getting away with 43% less thrust while accomplishing the same mission is puzzling, but General Atomics does say they built extra margin into their design. Still, that’s a big and peculiar thrust differential. Lockheed hasn’t disclosed their engine choice for their flying-wing MQ-25 yet . Boeing’s UCLASS concept art didn’t feature such an exotic and stealthy intake design. Quite the opposite actually, it showed their design with a relative large extruded dorsal intake and s-shaped duct. , Boeing Boeing clearly has some solutions for these potential issues in mind, and they may be revolutionary if they actually work in such a demanding flight environment as what’s experienced by carrier-based aircraft. It will be very interesting to hear them justify their inlet design choice in particular, and how they will sell it considering the MQ-25 tender requires absolutely no low-observability or radar signature reduction (stealth). The video also features our first concept animation of Boeing’s Stingray in action. It’s worth noting that the aircraft depicted looks nearly identical—spare a couple new antennas—to their MQ-25 prototype. This is somewhat surprising as there has been a lot of talk that Boeing’s final MQ-25 design will deviate somewhat from the recycled prototype’s configuration. Some have questioned if it can carry enough fuel to actually meet the MQ-25’s fairly aggressive offload requirements, which include being able to fly 500 miles from the carrier and transferring 14,000lbs of gas before returning back to the carrier. It has even been reported that that Boeing may be working on a second prototype to showcase a final configuration. These reports could end up being false considering the concept imagery the company is now releasing. MQ-25 about to refuel a Block III Super Hornet. Note the sensor ball under its nose and the locations of its refueling store and external fuel tank. , Boeing video screencap We also finally get to see where the aircraft’s Cobham refueling pod will be mounted along with an external fuel tank. An impressive head-on view of Boeing’s MQ-25. Note the UHF satcom antenna behind the aircraft’s flush inlet. , Boeing Screencap It’s still not clear where a Ku band/microwave satcom installation will be housed on Boeing’s MQ-25. Both General Atomics’ and Lockheed Martin’s designs clearly have an area for it, but it’s less evident on Boeing’s entrant. Putting a big lump on its upper forward fuselage may further complicate airflow issues with its inlet design. Some have mentioned that the ‘humps’ on the aircraft’s wings could be satcom antenna enclosures. That’s unlikely as it seems those bulges are there to accommodate the MQ-25’s wing-folding mechanism. Maybe Boeing will install one behind the jet’s air inlet if it wins the MQ-25 tender. A glimpse of the future? MQ-25 refueling a Block III F/A-18F., Boeing video screencap Regardless of the questions still orbiting around Boeing’s Stingray design, the company hopes that the fact that they are the only competitor with an actual prototype will help lead them to victory. Don Gaddis, Boeing Phantom Works MQ-25 program director told our friends at Flightglobal the following last week during a visit to the company’s St. Louis plant: “I think what makes it unique is it is built. We’ve already demonstrated a lot of the functionality… The deck handling, the software, the mission computer, the vehicle management system, the Rolls-Royce engine, we’ve already demonstrated a lot of this stuff. We’ve done almost everything short of flying.” That may all be true, but considering the questions that remain about the company’s design, not flying the supposedly ready to fly prototype seems like a suspect decision. Hopefully, Boeing will change their minds and prove that their design is indeed ready to fly by doing exactly that—flying. We should expect even more details from all three companies vying for the MQ-25 contract now that all of their designs have been officially unveiled. But the biggest question that looms over the MQ-25 program is exactly how much support does it really have within the Navy, and it’s not as if other potentially far less costly alternatives don’t exist.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Feb 21, 2023",U.S. Special Operators in Syria Have Set Up Futuristic Computer-Assisted Mortar Turrets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As the conflict in Syria continues to evolve , the U.S. government is re-examining what its future presence in the country might look like and for how long. In the meantime, American troops there are settling into increasingly more established forward outposts with improved defenses, including the futuristic-looking Advanced Mortar Protection System, or AMPS. Earlier in April 2018, Kurdish media reported that U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a group also known as the SDF that predominantly consists of Kurds, had established two new operating sites near the strategic city of Manbij in northern Syria. Subsequent images and video showed that American special operations forces were also present and had brought mine-resistant trucks , Humvees , and other vehicles with them , as well as heavy weapons, including .50 caliber machine guns, automatic 40mm grenade launchers, and the AMPS . American special operators have been working closely with those fighters in that particular part of Syria since at least March 2017 when they first appeared in order to effectively block Turkish-supported factions from moving into the area. The United States and Turkey, as well as their respective partners, are increasingly in an armed stand-off in the country over America’s support for the SDF, which Turkish authorities say is a terrorist group in its own right. You can read more about that complicated dispute here . In addition, U.S. military personnel throughout Syria have increasingly had to contend with other factions, including Kremlin-linked mercenaries , militias aligned with the country’s dictator Bashar Al Assad, and Iranian-backed groups . American troops have actually come to blows with all of these groups, as well as Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army fighters . “We’re going to continue to improve our defenses, that’s what’s going on around us to this day and rehearse our plan and hope it doesn’t happen again,” U.S. Army Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, director of operations for the main U.S. military task force in charge of operations in Iraq and Syria, told NBC’s Richard Engel in March 2018. The officer was referring specifically to the situation in the country’s Deir ez-Zor governorate , further southeast of Manbij, but the attitude seems to apply to American operations elsewhere. And that’s where the AMPS would seem to come in. At its core, the system, also known as the XM905, is a relatively portable 120mm mortar on a rotating base plate so troops can fire it in any direction. Defense contractor Mistral, Inc. , in cooperation with Israeli firm Elbit, produce the weapon. The XM905 Advanced Mortar Protection System, also known as the Improved Enhanced Mortar Targeting System (EMTAS)., Mistral, Inc. Unlike many traditional infantry mortars, the weapon itself, called the XM908, has a recoil mechanism, giving it the appearance of a small howitzer, which helps reduce the shock of firing and improves accuracy. Three feet attached to the weapon’s base plate further stabilize the firing platform. The mortar, a derivative of Elbit’s Cardom Recoil Mortar System 6-Light, or RMS6-L, is the same one the U.S. Army employs on some of its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles . The weapon’s base has its own battery-powered traverse system that can slew the weapon 180 degrees in 12 seconds to fire automatically at coordinates troops input into a computerized fire control system . The motorized arrangement can still aim the weapon accurately even if the platform isn’t on level ground. Troops in an M1129 Stryker Mortar Carrier Vehicle fire their 120mm mortar, which is the same as the one found on the XM905 AMPS., US Army The mortar has a maximum range of between four and five miles, depending on the ammunition type, which can include high explosive rounds, shells that create concealing smoke, and ones that release illuminating flares for night-time operations. Combined with the computerized fire control system, the earliest versions of the system could reportedly hit targets within an area approximately half a percent as wide as the firing distance. This means that at a mile, the crew can expect the shell to fall within a circle less than 30 feet wide. Closer in, it can deliver more impressive results and rapidly. But more importantly, it offers immediate extended range fire support for troops at remote bases, who may not have the time to wait for other artillery or air support to become available. And that has been the goal of the system since it first entered service in an almost emergency capacity in 2011. The year before, the Pentagon’s Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office, or CTTSO, rushed 10 of an earlier version of the system, then known as the Enhanced Mortar Targeting System, or EMTAS, to special operators and conventional Army and Marine units in Afghanistan. That entire effort cost nearly $9 million. “Existing Forward Operating Base (FOB) defense systems currently provide only the capability to detect, provide warning, and assess potential threats,” a subsequent Pentagon budget document explained in requesting additional funds to sustain the project. “At smaller, more remote locations, the kinetic response capability is limited only to existing organic weapon systems, which can become overwhelmed; or, to supporting arms which may be unavailable due to weather, competing requirements or Rules of Engagement (ROE).” An overview of the CTTSO’s original EMTAS project., CTTSO In 2013, another urgent request from special operators in Afghanistan called for more and better versions of the system to guard their operating sites, resulting in the Improved EMTAS. The Pentagon’s Rapid Reaction Technology Office, or RRTO, coordinated that program, which the Army subsequently managed. The service then rebranded the weapon as the AMPS and continues to support the system on behalf of the special operations community. Elbit also offers a further improved version of the system, known as the Spear Mk 2, for a wide variety of vehicle and dismounted applications. In Syria, where battle lines and the allegiances of certain groups can change rapidly, having the mortars in place gives American troops and their partners significant firepower in the event that they come under attack. It’s no surprise that the forces in Manbij, who are now concerned about a new Turkish-backed intervention , have decided to move the weapons into place to help guard their positions. Elbit’s Spear Mk 2 on a Plasan Sandcat 4×4 light vehicle., Joseph Trevithick “I want to get out – I want to bring our troops back home,” U.S. President Donald Trump said at a press conference on March 3, 2018. “It’s time. We were very successful against ISIS.” But the presence of these heavily fortified sites, defended in part by emplaced weapons such as the computer-assisted mortars, seems to suggest that American troops are expecting to remain in Syria for the foreseeable future. Correction: The original version of this article said that the initial versions of the EMTAS had the ability to hit within an area with a diameter equivalent to five percent of the range. The stated accuracy was in fact half a percent. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com Joseph Trevithick Deputy Editor Around The Globe Middle East News & Features Syria"
Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 10, 2018",If Reports Of Deadly Gas Attack In Syria Are True Will U.S. Strike As Promised?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports of a possible gas attack in Douma , Syria are spiking on social media. Stated casualty counts surrounding the incident vary, but some claim 45 people were killed and nearly 1,000 injured as the result of the attack, with victims showing symptoms related to the use of chemical weapons. These reports come on the one year anniversary of the U.S. attack on Shayrat Air Base in response to a gas attack on the Syrian town of Khan Shaykhun that happened just a few days prior. Douma, a town in Eastern Ghouta , one of the last bastions of resistance in the area, has come under heavy bombardment in recent days as Assad’s forces attempt to win back the eastern suburb of Damascus once and for all. The pictures and video that are said to be the result of the strike are incredibly graphic, you can check them out here , here , and here for yourself. They depict civilian women, men, and children dead with no apparent trauma to their bodies, but foaming at the mouth and appear to be asphyxiated. Other images show civilians being treated for the effects of chemical weapons exposure. The Assad regime denies that it launched a gas attack on the embattled town. At the highest levels, the United States has said it would not tolerate another chemical weapons attack by Assad on his own people. Just last February, Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned Syria of dire consequences if Assad were to execute chemical weapons strikes. He also made it clear that he doesn’t think Assad destroyed his chemical weapons stockpiles as promised under the Russian-brokered disarmament deal established during the Obama administration. Other threats from the Trump administration against Assad pertaining to the potential use of chemical weapons have repeatedly occurred since the Tomahawk missile strikes a year ago. Last June, then White House Spokesman Sean Spicer put out a statement reading: “As we have previously stated, the United States is in Syria to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. If, however, Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.” Just days ago, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley stated the following regarding Syria’s chemical weapons: “The Assad regime continued using chemical weapons against the Syrian people… One member [Russia] of this council shielded the Assad regime from any consequences and then blocked us from renewing the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM). Our consensus broke down… Our lack of action has consequences. When we let one regime off the hook, others take notice… The use of nerve agents in Salisbury and Kuala Lumpur proves this point and reveals a dangerous trend.” Meanwhile, Russia’s media machine has been running in high gear in recent weeks saying that the U.S. was planning to strike at Assad under false pretenses and that Moscow would defend its man in Damascus if such an operation were executed by Washington. Additionally, Russian news outlets continue to posit that al Nusra and the Free Syrian Army are the ones plotting chemical weapons attacks . The already failing relationship between the U.S. and Russia has hit new lows in recent weeks following the nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the United Kingdom. This has resulted in the temperature being dropped diplomatically between Russia and the West, with a rash of diplomatic expulsions occurring in response. The brutal situation in East Ghouta has also led to more friction between Washington and Moscow, which you can read all about in this recent War Zone article . Kinetic engagements between Russian elements in Syria have also become a brutal reality . Yet this attack, if indeed it occurred as it is being reported, comes at an especially pivotal time. Last week was marked with headlines stating that President Trump now wants out of Syria in the short term. This goes against a slew of statements made over the last year by the Trump administration and the Department of Defense, which have repeatedly said U.S. forces will stay in Syria until ISIS is fully defeated—and even potentially longer . The White House has since stepped back from Trump’s comments, with some sources saying that the President has given the DoD six months to get the job done when it comes to defeating ISIS before a widespread withdrawal of U.S. forces is initiated. Many critics think that any vacuum left by the U.S. will be immediately exploited by Syria, Russia, Turkey, and other players in the convoluted Syrian conflict and it could result in the rise of an ‘ISIS 2.0’ of sorts that would be reminiscent of how the terror group rapidly grew to strength and reach after the U.S. pulled out of Iraq in 2011. So the big question now is will the Trump administration punish Assad militarily if he did indeed launch a gas attack on his own people again? Doing so would not be as easy as it was in 2017. Russia has not only said it would actively defend Assad in a similar attack, and they would retaliate against U.S. interests in the region in kind, but they have also upgraded Assad’s air defense system and integrated it with their own far more advanced air defense components. The Trump administration’s 2017 cruise missile strikes on Syria were also laughably ineffective militarily. Shayrat Air Base was up in running again just hours after dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles attempted to pummel it into submission. Assad actually gained materiel and political support from Russia as a result of the strike and has continued his brutal onslaughts on rebel-held territories in Syria. Today Assad holds far more territory in western Syria than he did a year ago and his regime is much more secure. With this in mind, a response to another chemical attack would likely come in the form of a far more robust set of strikes aimed at taking away something tangible and meaningful from Assad, like regime installations or his air integrated air defense network. Such an operation would require far more risk and capability and would put manned aircraft at risk, even if in the form of a handful of B-2 Spirits and F-22 Raptors. We’ll have to wait and see how this story develops, but if indeed these deaths and injuries were the results of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime it seems that Trump and his National Security Team—which is now led by a far more hawkish cadre than it was a year ago—will be forced to act. Otherwise, they will lose all credibility on the chemical weapons use policy that they were so willing to enforce a year ago. Not following through with their myriad threats would also impact the leverage they have going into the negotiations with North Korea—a topic that is very much on the top of Trump’s mind. Either way, the continued use of chlorine gas and the possible use of much more deadly chemical weapons is a reminder of just how ineffective America’s punitive missile strikes on Syria were a year ago. They may have played wonderfully for domestic consumption, but their actual impact on Assad’s war machine and decision-making process seems to have been trivial at best .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 11, 2020",Exclusive Images Unmask Name Of Scaled Composites’ Mysterious Model 401 ‘Son Of Ares’ Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Since Scaled Composites first unveiled their exotic Model 401 experimental aircraft last October the jet has been spending substantial time in the sky. Yet still, few photos of it publically exist. Now, with exclusive new images obtained by The War Zone, we not only get a unique view of this mysterious flying machine, but we also discover some of its special features. But what’s most exciting is the images unmask the program’s cryptic nickname and hint at what its mission might be. The photos were taken at Mojave Air And Space Port by one of the family here at The War Zone, Matt Hartman, an avid Southern California aerospace photographer , and proprietor of Shorealonefilms.com . Matt Hartman After closely examining the photos it seems we were lucky enough to have stumbled on what appears to be an insightful set of clues as to what this flying machine is meant to do and its in-house nickname and lore. Matt Hartman One of the people that were in close proximity to the jet as it received service on the apron had a shirt on with a huge crest stating ‘Son of Ares’ on top and ‘Phobos Deimos’ on the bottom. At its center is a Spartan warrior’s helmet with what appears to be the letters phi and delta from the Greek alphabet on either side of that helmet. Matt Hartman Son Of Ares is a clear callback to the company’s small close air support combat aircraft concept that was designed in the 1980s and first took to the skies in 1990. Named ARES for Agile Responsive Effective Support, this aircraft emerged out of a study by two Army aviators dubbed the Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft (LCBAA). Legendary aircraft designer and founder of Scaled Composites Burt Rutan joined the study to come up with an airframe design that could plug what was perceived as a gap in the Pentagon’s close air support portfolio. The DoD said they would evaluate the aircraft if Rutan built it, so he did. The result was a bizarre but amazingly innovative little flying machine. In essence, it was a little flying gun, packing a GAU-12 25mm cannon on one side and a semi-recessed air inlet on the other in an ingenious arrangement. It was also envisioned that the ARES could carry other armaments, like rockets and small guided munitions. The ARES platform was classic Rutan, with twin tail booms, canard foreplanes, and elegantly sculpted lines. A JT15D-5 turbofan—a derivative of which also powers the Model 401—provided enough thrust to spirit the small carbon-fiber jet up to a speed of 400 knots. The aircraft was never considered for production but it supposedly performed very well in testing and evaluations. In 1992, it even starring in the cheesy air combat flick Iron Eagle III as the ‘Messerschmitt Me 263.’ By around the end of the millennium, the plane was put into storage. It remained there until it was resurrected in 2008 to work as a flying testbed. Since then the pint-sized jet has been quite active and it has been spotted with extreme modifications that point to possible surrogate work for systems destined for stealthy unmanned aircraft. ARES, now approaching 30 years old, was most recently seen at the LA County Air Show in Lancaster, California late last month. The tiny but highly upgraded cockpit of Scaled Composites’ ARES demonstrator. (Photo credit Corporate Flight Management) pic.twitter.com/OV6Yg8DJ96 — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) December 2, 2017 Here’s a great photo walk around of the jet as it is configured now. So clearly this program has legendary status within Scaled Composites rich history and lore. The Model 401, with its stealthy design traits and small tactical jet overall concept, likely evolved from a similar spirit as ARES, and its intended applications are clearly battlefield related. But instead of packing a big cannon, it could very well aim to test directed energy weapons or advanced sensors that could enjoy synergistic effects by being mounted on a medium altitude, medium endurance low observable platform. The names Phobos and Deimos are extremely important too. Theos.com’s description of their place in Greek mythology reads as such: DEIMOS and PHOBOS were the gods or personified spirits ( daimones ) of fear. Deimos represented terror and dread, while his brother Phobos was panic, flight and rout. They were sons of the war-god Ares who accompanied their father into battle, driving his chariot and spreading fear in his wake. As sons of Aphrodite, goddess of love, the twins also represented fear of loss. This all makes more sense considering there are actually two Model 401s in existence. Their registrations : N401XD (Deimos) and N401XP (Phobos). The warlike and downright scary nature of their names also alludes to the probability that they are designed for intensive military applications. You have to hand it to Scaled Composites for coming up with such a rich and well-tailored mythological metaphor for the Model 401 program—a program of which we still don’t know if there is an external benefactor or customer. Making things even more interesting, as we have posited before, one of these aircraft, X4014D, may be an unmanned variant, hence the P for piloted and D for drone in the registrations and in reference to their newly discovered nicknames. We previously wrote about this possibility , stating: “The theory is highly speculative but maybe there is something to it. Having one aircraft be manned and a near identical copy be unmanned, with a fairing replacing the canopy and covering the cockpit, and avionics and a satellite communications systems taking the cockpit’s place, would allow for manned and unmanned tests of equipment on a common platform. Once again, such a concept would also allow for these tests to occur over areas that currently do not allow unpiloted aircraft operations. This would not only be advantageous for getting new systems fielded faster but it would also provide a control variable for testing manned versus unmanned capabilities against each other.” It’s also possible that an unmanned and manned pair could work to develop cooperative ‘manned-unmanned teaming’ and ‘loyal-wingman’ operational concepts and the hardware and software that goes along with it. Scaled Composites has only said the two aircraft are similar in mold-line, and won’t comment any further than that which has added to the mystery. Moving on from the newly discovered ‘Son of Ares’ moniker, the photos also offer the first views of large bays located below the aircraft that are easily accessed by ground personnel. These will likely carry advanced sensors and other systems in the aircraft’s future. As mentioned earlier, they may even be fitted with a directed energy weapon system considering the aircraft’s supposed lineage and name. Matt Hartman The aircraft looks so much like a mix between Boeing’s Quiet Bird —and somewhat like its Bird of Prey demonstrator that was flown three and a half decades later—and General Atomics Avenger . In fact, the Model 401’s wings appear to be nearly a dead ringer to those found on the Avenger. Scaled Composites These likenesses have led us to wonder if either General Atomics or Boeing has something to do with the program. Also made more evident in these images are the Model 401’s wing’s extreme dihedral. It remains unclear what benefit this offers the design. Even with this new information, and beyond basic performance estimates and specifications, we still don’t know all that much about this aircraft or its supposed twin. But at least we now have a good probability of understanding its lineage and lore within the company. We're still flying high from yesterday's #firstflight !

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Compelling Case For Turning S-3 Vikings Into The Navy’s New MQ-25 Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) initiative, now commonly referred to as the MQ-25 Stingray program, has heated up, and all three competitors have unveiled their proposed unmanned tanker designs . But considering the dwindling ambitions and ever-lengthening timelines that have plagued the Navy’s initiative to field a drone of any kind for its carriers, one has to question why the service needs a purpose-built tanker drone at all, especially considering that a potentially far more economical and faster solution may have been quietly baking in the Arizona sun for nearly a decade. The idea of retooling the mothballed S-3 Viking fleet into unmanned drones popped up in a twitter conversation recently on our friend Stephen Trimble’s page . At first, I had the feeling of deja-vu, but then I remembered I proposed doing just that six years ago and brought it up again two years later. VX-30 was the last Navy unit to operate the S-3. They used jets for range clearing and monitoring duties as well as for test various subsystems. , Tyler Rogoway/Author The fact of the matter is the Pentagon still has 108 S-3 Vikings serving as rattlesnake shades down at its boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. 83 of those are S-3Bs, 10 are S-3As, and 15 are ES-3As. The Viking was controversially retired from service in 2009, with a handful of jets continuing to serve in support roles till 2016 . NASA is now the last S-3 operator, having a lone S-3B that works as a test platform out of the Glenn Research Center. The last Vikings: The final four S-3s still flying at the time sat together on the NAS Point Mugu ramp back in September of 2014. Now just NASA’s jet remains in the air. VX-30 lost their beloved S-3s not because the jets had issues, but because the Navy didn’t want to pay to put them through scheduled depot maintenance. , US Navy The thing is that the average S-3 in storage has half its life still left in it. The airframes were cleared to operate out to a whopping 18,750 hours. Their engines are still widely used on various aircraft, including everything from the A-10 Warthog to business jets to regional airliners. And apparently, there are a lot of S-3 spare parts still on hand. The aircraft have been available for potential export for years, and South Korea wanted a number of them for a time, although they have since moved away from the deal and are now looking for a more advanced maritime patrol aircraft. USN The S-3B already served the twilight of its career as a tanker, lugging roughly 16,000lbs of gas around while carrying a buddy-refueling pod. But Lockheed once had a far more ambitious plan for the type when it came to the tanker mission. An article in P-3publications.com recalls this past “KS-3” initiative: “One of the first proposed S-3 variants was a tanker concept for in-flight refueling of carrier-based aircraft. Designated KS-3, the dedicated tanker concept consisted of a standard S-3 wing fuel tank and refueling probe but added a conformal weapons bay fuel tank, wing pylon mounted drop tanks and a dual internal hose and reel drogue system. The aircraft also included additional dual ground refueling receptacles. This would speed the on-deck refueling turnaround time. The tanker concept also comprised state-of-the-art navigational and communications avionics with provisions for secondary mission capabilities to conduct EW (electronic warfare) and C3 (communications relay) operations. In order to prove the S-3 tanker concept to the Navy, Lockheed proposed developing an operational KS-3 demonstrator aircraft. To keep costs down, an existing flight test S-3 Viking was modified into the in-flight tanker configuration. Ship No. 5 of Lockheed’s S-3A flight test program was diverted and equipped with a bolt on belly tank (simulating the proposed conformal weapons bay tank) modified wing pylons for 600 gallon drop tanks and a single hose and reel drogue system incorporated into the fuselage. The designated KS-3A prototype was flown for almost two years and proved to be a remarkably stable and efficient refueling platform. It demonstrated the ability to move large quantities of fuel with a minimum fuel consumption which maximized available fuel for in-flight transfer. During tests, the KS-3A refueled a variety of Navy aircraft. With its ability to be replenished itself in-flight using its refueling probe the S-3 could give up more fuel than any other carrier-based tanker aircraft to date. But despite its laurels, the Navy did not buy the KS-3, so none were produced. The modified KS-3A was later used for pilot training by VS-41 before being re-configured as a US-3A COD aircraft.” The KS-3 prototype refuels a US-3A COD Viking derivative. , Photo via P-3publications.com In total, this KS-3 Viking derivative would be able to carry a whopping 30,000lbs of gas—and possibly more today if further modifications were made. The current requirement for the Navy’s MQ-25 drone is to be able to fly out to 500 miles and offload 14,000lbs of gas and then safely return to the carrier. In other words, the KS-3 would shatter that requirement. By our calculations, an S-3 burns roughly 1,600lbs an hour at cruise. It would take roughly 1.5 hours to reach its station and the same time on the return trip. That is 4,800lbs of gas. Add in an hour of loiter time and margin for launch and recovery, and that totals around 7,000lbs just as a rough estimate. Add an extra 1,000lbs for good measure. That leaves 22,000lbs of fuel to offer to its ‘customer’ aircraft. When you consider all the engineering had been done and paid for decades ago to turn the S-3 into a dedicated tanker, and the configuration has even been flight tested for two years, the risk and costs in doing so now today would be minimal. To save even more time and money, and in exchange for a little fuel, the existing Cobham aerial refueling pod could be used under the wing instead of an internal system. In fact, the MQ-25 program requires the use of this pod on any entrants into the tanker-drone tender. USN In addition, an updated KS-3 would still have room for additional capabilities. The MQ-25 tender requires the aircraft have an electro-optical sensor ball, and the S-3B already has such a system that retracts in and out of the fuselage that could be easily upgraded with a new unit. It also has a big radar aperture that is ideally suited for surface search radar. There is also plenty of room for communications relay and satellite communications gear as well, much of which could make use of the jet’s existing infrastructure. And as the quote above stated, a KS-3 can do what no current MQ-25 entrant can—it can take on fuel in midair itself. This drastically increases its operational flexibility. As for a concept of operations, an ‘MQ-3T’ could be optionally manned, being flown by a human during positioning flights, and put to use in an unmanned fashion onboard the carrier and for training missions over designated airspace. Alternatively, they could be strictly unmanned, which would provide even more weight and space savings that could allow for even more fuel to be carried. Still, the optionally manned factor could be key to any Navy tanker-drone program’s survival—more on that in a moment. General Atomics MQ-25 Stingray design., General Atomics These adapted airframes could leverage all the research garnered from the X-47B program and incorporate that as well as other relevant emerging technologies into their control suites. As for how hard this would be to accomplish, I asked someone who works in this exact space. They said it would be easier than incorporating it into a new drone and would allow for redundancy that would help quickly prove the unmanned concept and the technologies it relies on. They also mentioned the QF-16 program as a reference along with other developments in the semi-autonomous unmanned space, like those related to the Navy’s MQ-4C Triton program. It’s also worth noting that all the competing companies in the MQ-25 tender have semi-autonomous control software and interface experience as well that they could build into the MQ-3T tanker for unmanned operations just like they could with an MQ-25 drone. USN The Navy already blew it by not procuring a multi-role Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) capable of penetrating enemy airspace over long distances as was originally planned. Those programs morphed over the last decade or so from J-UCAS to UCLASS before turning into the non-stealthy tanker MQ-25 program as we know it today—with a few projects strewn in between. Because of the Navy’s ever-changing requirements and their decreasing fiscal attractiveness to contractors, every entrant into the MQ-25 contest heavily draws upon or is a direct remodel of previous work done for the now-defunct Naval UCAV programs. In other words, none of the MQ-25 competitors are proposing a full-fledged ‘clean-sheet’ design or even building prototypes of such a design. As a result, there are significant risks with all the bidders’ proposals, no matter how much they say there isn’t. The X-47Bs were hugely successful and promising yet in a stunning and laughably illogical move, the Navy stepped away from the concept to procure a dumbed-down tanker instead. The aircraft, or one like it, clearly threatened the F-35C program and manned carrier aviation in general for certain mission sets. , USN The one company who had put a real flying carrier-based drone prototype through extensive testing and even operated from a carrier and refueled from a tanker with it is Northrop Grumman and their X-47B demonstrators . The company, which was favorited to win by many, dropped out of the MQ-25 contest abruptly last fall. This may have been a very wise decision in retrospect. The cost of just going the next step and fielding a proper UCAV over a tanker-drone that will have similar features anyways seems negligible. So the question is why should the Navy spend a ton of money and take on huge risk for a totally new tanker drone when they can potentially reuse a known commodity they already own, one that will likely have more flexibility and capability from day one than the alternative? The service can proceed with procuring a family of advanced unmanned combat aircraft systems, including a tanker capability, while the refitted S-3s prove the concept of carrier-borne drone operations. And above all else, under such a plan, the Navy can field a tanker capability in a far quicker timeframe than what the current MQ-25 program currently proposes. USN When it comes to risk, the S-3s are essentially free. If they end up in the water during the unmanned carrier operations teething process, oh well, it’s a cheap price to pay for proving a game-changing technology and providing a needed capability to the fleet. Dumping high-tech drones that cost tens of millions of dollars into the sea, on the other hand, would be a scandal and could the essential future of unmanned carrier operations in doubt. As of 2014, there were 87 S-3s that could be converted for future use according to Lockheed officials . That number has likely gone up as the final three Navy S-3s have since been retired, some of which were the best of the lot. At the very least, 90 aircraft are available for conversion and Lockheed said it would support those jets throughout their service lives if they returned to flight—well that’s what they said before they were competing for the MQ-25 unmanned tanker contract. Some of the Vikings stored at AMARG., Google Earth Considering just four aircraft based on the MQ-25 winning design will be built before the Navy decides if it will order a total of 72 aircraft, there are plenty of S-3s to satisfy this requirement. As we mentioned before, the beauty of using the S-3 is that Navy could obtain its first prototypes far faster than what’s demanded under the MQ-25 contract, under which the first four aircraft won’t be delivered till around 2023. And that is if everything goes as planned and if the program even survives till then. Lockheed’s flying-wing MQ-25 design., Lockheed Martin So in essence, before the Navy spends billions on new MQ-25 tanker drones, they should seriously consider resetting the program to include a family of unmanned systems, namely a penetrating UCAV and closely related tanker, and move immediately to field the S-3 in the unmanned tanker role. By having the craft optionally manned it would also have a much better chance of actually making it to operational fruition as by all indications the MQ-25 program, as it sits today, seems to have fluctuating support at best among the pilot-dominated Navy aircraft procurement apparatus. With more Super Hornets now on the order books , and a service life extension program spinning-up for the oldest F/A-18E/Fs, the need to offset the tanker role will become less pressing. As such, a cheap, optionally manned, S-3 recycling program of sorts will have a far better chance of surviving, especially if it provides a truncated timeline for fielding an operational capability and reduced costs. Although Lockheed would have to be involved in any regenerated S-3 initiative to some degree, the contract to develop the aircraft into an unmanned system and to run the program as the lead contractor can be open to anyone. This is not unprecedented in any way. BAE System ran the QF-4 program and Boeing currently runs the QF-16 program. Once the S-3s have done the job of ‘bridging the gap’ between unmanned and manned carrier aviation, and the new family of advanced unmanned systems is ready in the coming decade, the Vikings can be finally put to rest. USN You may wonder why such an initiative wasn’t put into practice, or at least seriously considered already considering the S-3s are just sitting there. Remember, recycling old aircraft into new useful platforms isn’t glamorous. It won’t provide a windfall of revenue for a defense contractor, nor will it be something a congressman can spike the football with to their constituents. And above all else, it won’t be a program that will put extra stars on shoulders of the Navy brass nor guarantee them lucrative jobs at defense contractors once they leave the service. These factors alone are often times why logical gets washed away when it comes to weapons procurement. Beyond that, it seems incredibly logical and should be at least carefully examined in an official capacity before the MQ-25 contract is awarded late this Summer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The F-16 that crashed in the Nevada Test and Training Range on Wednesday morning belonged to the United States Air Force Flight Demonstration Team, more popularly known as the Thunderbirds . It’s with great sadness that we inform you that the pilot of that F-16 died in the incident. The official USAF announcement reads as such: “A U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds pilot was killed when his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed over the Nevada Test and Training Range today at approximately 10:30 a.m. during a routine aerial demonstration training flight. The identity of the pilot is being withheld for 24-hours pending next of kin notification. An investigation is being conducted into the cause of the mishap. The team’s participation at the March Air Reserve Base “The March Field Air & Space Expo” has been canceled.  It is unknown how this accident will impact the remainder of the 2018 Thunderbirds Season. More information will be provided as it becomes available.” The Thunderbirds were established 65 years ago and continue to perform in front of millions of people every year. They are the Air Force’s marquee recruiting and public outreach tool. The team is composed of top airmen from all over the service and operates a fleet of approximately a dozen Block 52 F-16C/D Vipers. This is the third aircraft loss in less than 24 months for the team. One loss occurred in June of 2016 shortly before recovering after a flyover in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The other jet was lost one year later as the result of roll-over incident in Dayton , Ohio during an inclement weather landing. Thankfully nobody was killed in either of those mishaps. Tyler Rogoway The team had gone through a somewhat sudden change in leadership somewhat recently. At the end of the last show season, Thunderbird #1, the team’s commanding officer, was relieved of his position. Lt. Col. Jason Heard was replaced by a new commanding officer by General Jeannie Leavitt, the commander of the 57th Wing at Nellis Air Force Base. Air Force Times quotes an official USAF release as stating: “While Heard led the team through a highly successful show season, Leavitt lost confidence in his leadership and risk management style… Leavitt determined that new leadership was necessary to ensure the highest levels of pride, precision and professionalism within the team.” Since Heard’s release last November, two-year team veteran Lt. Col. Kevin Walsh has led the Thunderbirds. Update: 11:30am PST— The USAF has identified what Thunderbird team member that died in Wednesday’s tragic accident, the official statement reads: “U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron Slot Pilot Thunderbird 4, Maj. Stephen Del Bagno, was killed when his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed over the Nevada Test and Training Range April 4, 2018 at approximately 10:30 a.m. during a routine aerial demonstration training flight. “We are mourning the loss of Major Del Bagno,” said Brig. Gen. Jeannie Leavitt, 57th Wing Commander. “He was an integral part of our team and our hearts are heavy with his loss. We ask everyone to provide his family and friends the space to heal during this difficult time.” An investigation is being conducted into the cause of the mishap.” USAF Here is the Major’s bio from the Thunderbrids website: “Maj. Stephen Del Bagno is the Slot Pilot for the U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, flying the No. 4 jet. He is a 2005 graduate of Utah Valley State University, and commissioned from Officer Training School, Maxwell AFB, Ala. in 2007. Before joining the Air Force, Del Bagno was a civilian flight instructor, corporate pilot, skywriter, and a banner tow pilot. He enjoys snowboarding, water sports and spending time with family and friends. Prior to joining the Thunderbirds, Del Bagno served as an F-35A Evaluator Pilot and Chief of Standardization and Evaluation, 58th Fighter Squadron, Eglin AFB, Fla. He has logged more than 3,500 total flight hours in over 30 different aircraft, with 1,400 hours as an Air Force pilot. Del Bagno is in his first season with the team and hails from Valencia, Calif.” What a tragic loss for the team, the USAF, and the country. At least it seems like Stephen Del Bagno died doing something he truly loved and while executing a mission he believed deeply in, and we are grateful for everything he gave his country.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet assigned to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada has crashed near the adjacent Nevada Test and Training Range , or NTTR, while reportedly on a routine training mission. This is the third U.S. military aircraft loss in less than 48 hours and fourth significant accident of any kind in that same time frame when one includes a hard landing a U.S. Marine Corps CH-53E Super Stallion suffered during a drill in the East African country of Djibouti. This latest incident reportedly occurred over the NTTR at 10:30 AM PST on April 4, 2018. We do not know the exact nature of the incident or the condition of the pilot, but officials at Nellis said that first responders were on the scene in an official statement . The Air Force has also not yet said what type of F-16 was involved or what unit or command the aircraft was assigned to, either. Nellis is situated just outside Las Vegas, Nevada and the NTTR is a sprawling set of test and training areas located to the northwest of the base. The range hosts various major exercises, including the Air Force’s Red Flag aerial warfare drills. Nellis-based F-16D., USAF The last of those events, Red Flag 18-2 officially ended on March 23, 2018 and the next one, Red Flag 18-3, is not scheduled begin until July 13, 2018. However, active, reserve, and test aircraft all use the same facilities for other training and experimental purposes throughout the year, as well. Just last January an EA-18G Growler belonging to the Royal Australian Air Force skidded off the runway at Nellis AFB and suffered significant damage. Thankfully both the pilot and the electronic countermeasures officer were able to escape the burning jet safely. This area is also home to secretive facilities such as the Tonopah Test Range Airport and Area 51 . In September 2017, another aircraft crashed inside the NTTR and the Air Force has so far declined to state what type it was or what it was doing at the time. A beloved test pilot was lost in that mishap. Nellis is the home of many F-16s which are used by the Weapons School, for supporting tactics development and testing, as well as to provide adversary services. But the most famous F-16 tenant at Nellis of all is the USAF Thunderbirds. The team practices nearby in the NTTR on a daily basis while not on the road.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 16, 2018",The Navy’s Giant Sea Base Is In The Middle East And Could Get Serious Medical Capabilities,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Navy’s new giant sea base, the USS Lewis B. Puller , is now on duty in the Middle East and the service is already experimenting with what the ship might be able to do. Currently, this includes acting a launch pad for boarding parties and special operators and serving as a platform for counter-mine operations. The ship might even eventually be able to take on the role of floating medical facility, which could be particularly important if one or both of the service’s existing hospital ships ends up in mothballs. Puller first arrived in the region in August 2017, at which point the U.S. Fifth Fleet took control of the ship from the Navy’s hybrid military-civilian Military Sealift Command (MSC). Officially termed an Expeditionary Sea Base, or ESB, the vessel took over for the USS Ponce , an aging amphibious ship the service converted to serve as an interim float staging platform. In September 2017, Ponce returned to Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia for decommissioning and eventual scrapping. “This ship is a blank canvas,” U.S. Navy Captain Joseph Femino said in a March 2018 interview with USNI News . “Whoever wants to come assess what they want, develop what they want, we’ll work to try and get that.” There’s a lot of space to work with since the ship is a whopping 764-feet long, 164-feet wide, and displaces a massive 78,000 tons. Derived from the Alaska -class oil tanker , it features a large open flight deck situated with four operating spots, two for take off and landing and two parking, that can support V-22 Osprey tiltrotors , various types of helicopters including the MH-53 Sea Dragon, and small tactical and helicopter-like drones, such as the ScanEagle and MQ-8 Fire Scout respectively. Below that there is a large open space that can accommodate small watercraft , cargo, containerized mission spaces, and more. Underneath, in the hull, there are massive ballast tanks that, at present, are just empty space. That feature is a holdover from Puller ’s two existing cousins, the differently configured USNS Montfort Point and USNS John Glenn . Those so-called Expeditionary Transfer Docks , or ESDs, provide a way to rapidly unload roll-on/roll-off and other traditional cargo ships in the absence of established or operational port facilities and lack the upper flight deck. On those ships, the crew can flood the tanks to settle it further down in the water, allowing landing craft , amphibious vehicles , or small boats to rapidly deploy on and off the ship The Puller ‘s crew maneuvers a small mobile pier on the ship’s main open mission bay., USMC Femino told USNI News that the ballast tanks and the capability they provide may not be necessary for ESB operations in the end. If the Navy decides this is the case, these spaces inside the hull could end up holding additional storage or mission compartments. The service already has two more of the sea base types under construction, which will receive the names Hershel “Woody” Williams and Miguel Keith. Whatever the final configuration might look like, the ESBs will be extremely flexible ships and able take on different roles. Modular or semi-modular equipment sets will allow the crew to rapidly convert the ship from one function to another in the future. Special operators have tested their ability to operate from the ship using a portable mission space tucked inside a shipping container and the service has tested other different possibilities, including quickly adding extensive medical capabilities to the ship. “I could build a hospital here; I could do anything I wanted, and it wouldn’t be at the cost of anything I’m designed to do, it would just be at the cost of what it takes to engineer it, design it, build it,” Femino said. “Our hospital ships are going away, so I actually had the force surgeon on today, I said, listen, I could build you all the beds you want across this [raised platform in the mission bay].” The officer’s comments might be a bit presumptuous as a battle appears to be emerging between the Navy and Congress over the final fate of the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort , the service’s two purpose-built floating hospitals. But he’s not wrong that Puller ’s ample space might be able to at least physically accommodate a set of more limited capacity facilities similar to the ones on those unique ships, which can handle up to 1,000 patients at a time and have a variety of specialized care and support suites. The USNS Mercy , one of the Navy’s two dedicated hospital ships., USN It’s worth noting that Mercy and Comfort both started life as oil tankers from the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company ( NASSCO ), the same company responsible for the Alaska -class that serves as the basis for the Puller and her cousins. It’s not clear how rapidly the Navy might be able to transform an ESB to a hospital and back again. Some equipment could fit inside containerized modules. Puller has already carried an Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical System (ERSS) team and their portable Role 2+ medical capability in an experimental capacity. This “out of the box” arrangement includes reception and triage centers and operating theaters, as well as a blood bank and other supply storage. Unfortunately, this particular setup doesn’t at all equal the Mercy or Comfort ’s Role 3 capability, which includes additional diagnostic facilities, more specialized intensive care and surgical suites, and other resources. They are truly floating hospitals in every sense of the word, not just ships with expanded sick bays. “If someone shows up with money and instead of spending the money we spend on Mercy and Comfort for a year of operations, they just build me out with that,” Femino suggested. But to do so might require more serious modifications that might not be as easy to swap out when the ship needs to take on another mission set, too. And there’s apparently limited impetus to explore that level of capability at the moment, too. Members of Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical System (ERSS) 15 prepare for a simulated surgery after setting up inside an empty warehouse during a training exercise., USN Femino also said the Puller “may never need a gigantic hospital,” given the relative proximity of the ship’s Middle Eastern operating area to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. That U.S. Army facility serves as a major medical hub for all U.S. military forces across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Germany is still relatively far away though, especially during high-end conventional operations. During the first Gulf War in 1991 and against during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Navy deployed its actual hospital ships to support those missions. An ESB configured as a hospital ship could help reduce the time it takes for seriously injured service members in Africa to receive adequate care, which has become an increasingly pressing issue as the United States steps up military activities across the continent . It could also support humanitarian and disaster relief missions and other “ soft power ” activities around the world. The latter term refers to instances where the U.S. military, often in cooperation with foreign partners and non-governmental organizations, provides free medical, humanitarian, and other civic assistance as a way of promoting American interests abroad. Having the ability to readily turn the future Williams or Keith into afloat medical facilities could be especially useful for operations in the Western Pacific where the “tyranny of distance” is and will continue to be a major tactical barrier to overcome. This reality could easily put troops thousands of miles from anything approaching a Role 3 medical facility during intensive combat operations. A profile view of Puller showing the ample available space in the mission bay under the main flight deck. , USN Still, with the Navy only planning to have three of the ships for the foreseeable future, having even one set up primarily as a hospital could limit their ability to perform other missions. The ESB’s other features will be equally important for any future distributed operations , particularly in the Pacific region. On top of that, the Navy’s plan is for sea bases to take up semi-permanent stations in certain regions, rather than move around from port to port, which could make it difficult for them to take up the same more mobile role that Mercy and Comfort now fill. At the same time, a relatively fixed, centralized medical capability might make good sense in certain areas where the United States routinely operates. Regardless, as it stands now, Puller is preparing to take up its primary role as a staging base for MH-53E Sea Dragon mine-hunting helicopters. Femino says the ship is also exploring the possibility of acting as a mothership for the Navy’s Avenger -class minesweepers forwarded deployed in the region. Counter-mine warfare is the ship’s primary mission in the Middle East, where those weapons could easily wreak havoc on operational movements in constrained areas such as the Strait of Hormuz leading in and out of the Persian Gulf and the Mandeb Strait between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. An MH-53E Sea Dragon on board Puller in 2016., USN In addition, the Marine Corps has sent a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) platoon to examine the ship’s capabilities, while special operators in the region have conducted a number of training exercises. Puller could serve as an important mobile staging platform for either group, who could readily make use of the ship’s flexible nature in order to respond to both short-notice crises or raids and more sustained operations throughout the Middle East. As already noted, The flight deck’s four operating spots are big enough to accommodate various tiltrotors and helicopters from the different services, to support those operations. The Marines recently used the ship as a staging platform for their MV-22 Ospreys during training exercises in the region. Helicopter or tilt-rotor type drones, including the MQ-8 and the Marine Corps’ still conceptual Marine Air Ground Task Force-Unmanned Expeditionary Capabilities unmanned aircraft, or MUX , would also be able to operate from the ship. An US Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey sits on Puller ‘s flight deck during a training exercise in April 2018., USMC That large open flight deck could serve as a firing platform for modular weapon systems, too. The Marines recently demonstrated their ability to f ire guided artillery rockets from the deck of an amphibious ship and there are various mobile or containerized missile and gun systems that could expand the sea bases capabilities in different environments, especially when working together as part of a larger, distributed force on land and at sea. But “we are here for MCM [mine countermeasures] support,” Femino explained to USNI News. “We are not here for SOF [special operations forces] support, we are not here for Marine support,” he added, despite the obvious value the ship will provide for those operations in the future. It seems likely that the sea bases will end up with at least some level of medical capability in the future, too. If the Navy decides that it is too expensive to retain Mercy , Comfort , or both hospital ships, Puller or her upcoming sister ships could become the most suitable platform to fill that resulting capability gap.

Joseph Trevithick and Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 5, 2018",Mysterious Northrop Grumman Spy Plane Emerges At The Mojave Air and Space Port,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We at The War Zone have been keeping a close eye on a small but potentially growing niche market for manned high-altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, some of which are derived from powered glider-type planes. Now a new entrant into this field, so far known only as the H03, from Northrop Grumman has emerged outside the company’s hangar at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Note to readers: Mystery solved! Feel free to read on but we have a positive ID on this aircraft and good information about its lineage explained in an update at the bottom of this article. Our good friend and long-time Southern California aerospace photojournalist Matt Hartman , proprietor of Shorealonefilms.com , captured these images of the overall gray aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) only approved the aircraft’s civil registration, N326JG, in August 2017, but we have no way of telling how long Northrop Grumman has been working on the project. Based on the pictures and the data the FAA makes publicly available, we know that the plane is a pusher type with a single reciprocating engine in the rear of the fuselage and features a tricycle style landing gear. It has long, slender, glider-like wings and a twin-boom tail arrangement connected by a single large stabilizer. This basic planform is commonly associated with aircraft intended for highly efficient, but typically low-speed flight at high altitudes. From what looks to be a pair of gull-wing doors on either side of the cockpit, it appears to have a crew of two who sit side-by-side. The overall shape is highly reminiscent of the twin-engine Schweizer 2-38 s that the U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Justice flew in the 1990s, but it’s clearly a distinct design. A full view of the H03’s impressive wingspan., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com The pusher propeller, with five narrow-chord blades, is also in line with this concept of operation. This configuration is similar to another experimental, high-efficiency aircraft also being developed in the Mojave Desert by tiny aviation firm Otto Aviation Group, which we were first to report on in 2017. Otto’s plans for their exotic bullet-shaped aircraft, known as the Celera 500L , includes two turbodiesels along with multi-stage turbochargers, advanced intercoolers, and heat exchangers that drive the aircraft’s main propeller. Though according to the FAA, the existing prototype only has one engine, it is possible that the company listed the arrangement as a single unified powerplant. This particular design is patented , but Northrop Grumman may have employed a similar concept on the H03. This would make a lot of sense in combination with the overall airframe design and its likely mission set and could explain the number of large air inlets that protrude out around the engine compartment. This not saying that such an arrangement is being used on the H03 definitively, another simpler powerplant could be used instead. Yet integrating some powerplant advancements into the high-flying design would help support the case for developing such an aircraft in the first place. A detail shot showing the H03’s sensor turret., Matt Hartman/Shorealonefilms.com We don’t know what Northrop Grumman made the aircraft’s wing and body out of, but lightweight composites are highly likely as they could give the aircraft even more impressive performance characteristics. This would have been an easy lift for Scaled Composites, the famed boutique aircraft design and manufacturing firm that Northrop Grumman acquired in 2007. Those materials could potentially help reduce the plane’s radar signature, as well. The overall design, especially the engine configuration and propeller shape, could also give it reduced acoustic and infrared emissions. All of this would make sense given the H03’s apparent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance role. The aircraft has a large sensor turret mounted underneath the fuselage, which could hold electro-optical, infrared, or multi-spectral video cameras , as well as laser range-finders or designators. There is a “platter” antenna on the right boom typically associated with UHF satellite communications, as well. There are likely other line-of-sight data-links which would allow the crew to transmit imagery back to base or to personnel on the ground in near real time. An antenna on the right tail could also provide connectivity or it could be used as part of an electronic intelligence gathering installation. There are no other mission systems readily visible, but the aircraft could have modular equipment bays for additional sensors. With the H03’s single engine, the nose is likely made available to carry various modular sensor payloads, as well. The 2-38, from which this design appears to be based on, at least conceptually, had a push-pull propeller arrangement that took up the bulk of the space forward of the cockpit. Additional equipment could include signals intelligence suites to monitor a target’s communications or compact synthetic aperture radars that can capture images through clouds, smoke, and other obscurants. A radar could also have a ground moving target indicator capability giving the aircraft more ability to monitor targets or more rapidly identify potential objects of interest. Northrop Grumman already supplies the AN/ZPY-5 Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VADER, to the U.S. Army and other government agencies for use on small manned surveillance aircraft and drones. The company is developing an improved Long Range Radar (LRR) with similar functionality, as well. These systems are sensitive enough to track human movements under various circumstances. A sample of VADER imagery, with red and green dots indicating contacts in motion., DHS These sensors, combined with the plane’s likely performance characteristics, could form a manned platform capable of persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions over a particular area for a protracted period of time. Its potential low signature features might allow the crew to perform those tasks discreetly and with a low probability of detection, especially against targets in low-threat environments such as insurgents, terrorists, and smugglers. The aircraft’s basic features coupled with a wide-angle or multi-camera wide-area aerial surveillance system would make it an ideal platform for developing so-called “ patterns of life ” for a particular individual or small group. This process involves intelligence analysts using imagery, radar data, and other forms of information to the better understand a target’s daily routines and typical movements, which in turn can help identify other subjects of interest or discreet bases of operations, especially within urban areas. And though we don’t know if Northrop Grumman has made this aircraft for a particular customer or as a private venture, it is obvious that there is a continued market for such planes. As already noted, the Coast Guard and Department of Justice have both operated similar designs in the past. Those Schweizer 2-38s configured for surveillance missions were themselves the outgrowth of concepts dating back to the Vietnam War. The H03’s propeller shape is actually very similar to the one on Lockheed Martin’s Vietnam-era YO-3A “quiet airplane.” A low-quality diagram showing the noise reducing features on the early YO-3A aircraft, including a similar, multi-blade propeller., USAF The Coast Guard had been eyeing successors to its 2-38s, which were designated RU-38As, under the Manned Covert Surveillance Aircraft (MCSA) program. The U.S. Air Force’s 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, a special projects office better known as “Big Safari,” managed the project on the service’s behalf. In 2014, the Coast Guard asked the Air Force to terminate the contract with Sikorsky, which had purchased Schweizer in 2004 and was working on two MSCA prototypes, over delays and cost issues. That project formally ended entirely in 2016, according to a response The War Zone obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. An undated image of Schweizer’s final 2-38B aircraft, also sometimes referred to as the RU-38B., via Airwar.ru But interest elsewhere within the U.S. government for such a platform appears to persist. In July 2017, a Grob G 520 , yet another similar type of aircraft, stopped at the North Vernon Municipal Airport in Indiana ahead of a series of U.S. military special operations forces exercises. The German manufacturer claims its latest G 520NG variants has the “lowest operational cost in class.” So, the H03 could just offer a similarly cost-effective surrogate for other more advanced manned and unmanned high-altitude intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, such as the U-2 Dragon Lady , RQ-4 Global Hawk , or even the RQ-170 Sentinel or a still classified aircraft . With this in mind, the H03 could be charted by various military and law enforcement organizations to stand-in for those more advanced types. Additionally, having a pilot at the controls means the aircraft can venture where unmanned systems currently cannot, and is far more deployable when it comes to supporting exercises and training evolutions. Similar types of manned aircraft that can stand-in for advanced high-altitude, medium and long-endurance surveillance aircraft are already in high demand for these tasks. They also work as testbeds to see how sensors and other systems function at high altitudes and under certain scenarios. Often times both tasks go hand-in-hand, where new payloads and sub-systems are rapidly evaluated during complex training exercises. A two-seat Grob 520T., Grob Aircraft For the same reasons the H03 would make a great surrogate for training and testing purposes, it also offers potential customers a less complex alternative to purchasing a drone with similar capabilities. It also may get around possible export concerns related to providing advanced unmanned high-altitude surveillance aircraft to foreign countries. Whatever the role Northrop Grumman intends for the H03’s exactly and whether the company has any customers in line yet, it is a clear indication that there is still a market for this class of aircraft. We’ll definitely be watching for more developments on this particular project and for any future appearances the plane might make in public. Update: The aircraft in question happens to be an evolved iteration of Scaled Composites Firebird optionally manned long-endurance aircraft. In fact, it appears to be a new variant of that second iteration. The original Firebird had a similar configuration but was a far more experimental looking affair and was about 30% smaller than the second iteration. Apparently, the second seat was added to the updated design at the behest of a still unknown buyer so that a copilot/payload operator could accompany the pilot when on manned missions. A single prototype was built of the first Firebird variant around the tun of the decade, which looked far more other-worldly than the second iteration of the design. Here the experimental aircraft is fitted with radar, electro-optical, and electronic intelligence payloads., Northrop Grumman/Scaled Composites The aircraft can fly without a crew onboard. When unmanned, a ground control station commands the aircraft via line-of-sight (LOS) data-links or a beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) satellite communications package that fits inside the cockpit. For the BLOS mode, the cockpit instruments come out and the canopy is replaced by a radome fairing that guards the satellite communications dish against the elements. Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman Apparently, after around 2013 two of these aircraft were to be built a year for an unspecified customer, but that seems unlikely to have occurred considering how little we have seen of them. But a couple variations do exist, at least based on FAA registrations and our observations. The one pictured in the first part of our article seems to have some alterations when compared to the earliest examples of the second generation Firebird. Most notably longer wings seem to have been fitted and changes have been made to the engine and nacelle configuration. This is likely why the designation is H03 instead of R02, which was assigned to at least two earlier iterations of the second generation Firebird. The FAA’s database says Northrop Grumman has two R02s (N241PR and N412DB) and one H03 (N326JG) registered to it. N355SX is the tail number of the original Firebird demonstrator aircraft. Supposedly a new Firebird costs just $10M in 2012 dollars and that includes a basic sensor and communications setup. Scaled Composites saw the aircraft just as we thought—as a platform for efficiently executing special long-endurance surveillance missions around the globe. And one that could be ferried to new locations by pilots before executing missions in theater in a manned or unmanned state. The first example of the second iteration of Firebird, the R02, on its maiden flight., Northrop Grumman The original Firebird could supposedly loiter for 40 hours at a time, which would make it more capable than the most advanced MQ-9 Reaper available and would even challenge the Global Hawk’s endurance capabilities. It’s not clear if the updated model is capable of such extreme performance with any sort of load, as its endurance is stated as being between 24 and 40 hours, but with the new upgrades maybe this is possible. Firebird aircraft have flown with all types of payloads, often being rapidly reconfigured to meet different demands in the field. These payloads include radar, electro-optical, communications relay, and signals intelligence suites. The aircraft can supposedly carry nearly 1,250lbs of sensors in its cavernous fuselage bays and in its sponsons. As for the aircraft’s powerplant, supposedly it uses a fairly pedestrian turbocharged Lycoming TEO-540E engine, which is a testament to the airframe’s super-efficient design. But it appears that the cowling configuration was changed on the H03 so it’s not clear if this engine is still being used. It’s possible that a new engine and wing combo was designed to boost the aircraft’s altitude, endurance, and load carrying capacity. In its original configuration, it could supposedly fly in the 30,000-35,000 foot altitude range as fast as 200 knots. All in all, the Mojave mystery planed turned out to me even more interesting and dynamic than we originally thought. Now with the basic part of this riddle solved we will be looking into who actually may have bought one of these aircraft, and if so, where has it been operating and what missions has it been accomplishing since it changed hands.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A CH-53E Super Stallion crashed near Naval Air Field El Centro at roughly 2:30pm local time on Tuesday. An official release from the USMC states that the helicopter belonged to the Third Marine Aircraft Wing based out of MCAS Miramar in nearby San Diego. CH-53s transit through and train in the area regularly. The four crew members onboard the Super Stallion are presumed dead. It’s worth noting that the CH-53 crash occurred just hours after the loss of another Marine Corps aircraft—an AV-8B Harrier that crashed on takeoff in Djibouti , Africa. In that incident the pilot survived, having ejected from the stricken jet as it went out of control. We have no clue what caused this tragedy but the USMC’s neglect of the CH-53 community is something that we have written about for years . A major reset program is underway to recapitalize the Super Stallion fleet and improve its availability that had plummeted to catastrophic levels after a decade and half of hard work in Afghanistan and Iraq. While the Army had invested heavily into resetting its helicopter fleet as it returned from battlefield operations overseas, the USMC had budgeted very little for similar services. USMC But even with the USMC’s belated initiative to refurbish its CH-53E fleet, as recently as last November officials from the service told congress that CH-53 fleet was still in a poor state, with only 143 of the type in inventory against a mandated fleet of 200. What’s worse is that of that truncated fleet, only 37% were flyable at any given time. Other major crashes, most notably particularly deadly one in Hawaii, underlined just how low morale was in the Sea Stallion community and how hard sustaining even basic qualifications had become for crews. You can read all about the CH-53’s tumultuous recent past and how the type’s future still remains bright in this past War Zone feature . That source of hope comes in the form of the CH-53K King Stallion —a hideously expensive updated variant of the H-53, but one that packs indispensable utility for the UMSC. That helicopter is now progressing through testing at a fairly fast clip but is still at least a year away from entering operational service, and even then it will do so in limited capacity. CH-53K King Stallion seen during testing., Sikorsky The USMC plans on buying 200 King Stallion helicopters to replace its rickety CH-53E fleet. Israel and Germany are also looking into purchasing the helicopter with a prototype having just been airlifted to Germany for display at the Berlin Air Show. But in the meantime the USMC will have to soldier on with its war-weary albeit slowly recovering Sea Stallion fleet. Hopefully they won’t be called into battle in such a sorry state. An investigation is underway to find out the reason for this horrible incident, we will keep you informed if any new details become available.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Is How The U.S. Military Is Already Patrolling And Working On The Border,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is clearly eager to implement hard line immigration and border security policies, including his signature promise to build a new border wall , and now says he will order the U.S. military to help secure the border with Mexico. Though his exact plans remain unclear and legal hurdles certainly exist, he might be surprised to find that American troops – and not just those assigned to the National Guard – are already supporting domestic law enforcement missions, conducting surveillance on the ground and in the sky and performing construction projects, including those related to the border. On April 3, 2018, Trump reiterated to reporters his desire for the U.S. military to take an active role at multiple events. Previously, in March 2018, the president called for using defense funds to pay for border wall after Congress passed an omnibus spending bill that included little money specifically for immigration or border security issues. By the end of the month, the Pentagon was reportedly drafting potential options for how such an arrangement might work. “I spoke with [Defense Secretary James] Mattis, we’re going to do some things militarily,” Trump said during a lunch with the heads of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military. That’s a big step.” He has not yet explained how the military could be involved, but there are already mechanisms in place that the Pentagon and the various service branches regularly use to get out on the border. A small, obscure office in El Paso, Texas called Joint Task Force-North (JTF-N), is responsible for reviewing and managing requests for military support on American soil from law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels and in coordination with tribal authorities on Native American reservations. A soldier from the US Army’s 94th Engineer Battalion chats with a member of the US Border Patrol during a JTF-N coordinated mission in 2010., JTF-N Now, these requests can’t be for anything at all, such as asking for battery of howitzers to shell drug traffickers. They have to fall into one of a number of well established categories that include helping repair vehicles and equipment, information technology and other administrative support, and the loaning of certain types of advanced systems, such as surveillance tools and communications devices. Military units, or private companies under contract to military commands, can provide actual military support, as well. Predominantly these missions take the form of providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets on the ground, at sea, or in the air – including unmanned aircraft and remotely operated sensors – moving personnel and materiel rapidly across long distances or to remote locations, and engineering services, such as building roads, bridges, barriers, and outposts. A broad overview of the kind of support the U.S. military can provide through JTF-N., JTF-N via FOIA If you think this puts very narrowly defined limits on what the U.S. military can do domestically, that really isn’t the case. It’s definitely true that a lot of the work is relatively mundane, such as adding military mechanics to a motor pool or having combat and civil engineers clear paths or erect towers. But U.S. Army ground reconnaissance units, dismounted or traveling in Humvees or Strykers , have also patrolled up and down the border using electro-optical and infrared surveillance systems to keep watch. Troops man tactical air surveillance radars to monitor for low-flying aircraft and other similar threats . Intelligence analysts and linguists pore over various pieces of information and intelligence products. A US Army soldier operates at Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3). This system, fitted to various Humvees and Strykers, contains various visual and infrared optics, as well as a laser range finder and GPS geo-location system, and is among the tools regular troops have employed along the border with Mexico., US Army The U.S. military treats many of these activities as effectively training exercises, as well, since the units in questions are likely to be headed off in the near future to perform similar missions in Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria. Watching for small groups of individuals in austere areas along the Mexican border is good preparation for doing the exact same thing in very similar terrain overseas. And, as noted, it’s not just actual U.S. military units performing these tasks. JTF-N sometimes coordinates with different services to hire contractors to provide various services just as they might in a combat zone. Between 2008 and 2013, private companies flew small, discreet intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft along the border in support of Customs and Border Patrol under at least three separate contracts to the U.S. Army. Documents The War Zone obtained via The Freedom of Information Act show that these programs – known as Big Crow, Big Miguel , and Big Ricardo – involved various planes with U.S. civil registrations carrying at least electro-optical and infrared cameras. A picture of a Big Ricardo aircraft, showing the sensor turret. Censors have redacted the plane’s civil registration code, as well as the license plate numbers on the government vehicle’s in the background., JTF-N via FOIA Records describing additional mission equipment, which could include other sensors such as signals intelligence suites or devices to geo-locate or monitor cell phone transmissions, are entirely redacted. Joint Task Force North, Customs and Border Protection, and the Army all declined to respond to questions regarding these activities and whether or not the missions continued after 2013 under a different name. The records we did obtain show that the Big Ricardo aircraft flew 600 hours along the border between Jan. 1 and May 15, 2013. During that time, the planes assisted in the apprehension of 3,000 suspected criminals and the seizure of more than 45,000 pounds of marijuana. Another 200 individuals got away and JTF-N credited the program with leading another 1,000 to turn back before reaching the border. Various statistics regarding the Big Ricrado program in 2013, as well as other historical information about previous military aerial surveillance efforts in support of Customs and Border protection., JTF-N Now, the requests JTF-N handles can’t be for help with any law enforcement activity at all, such as chasing down shoplifters or collecting parking tickets, either. U.S. laws and regulations allow U.S. military units to only help out domestically in counter-drug missions, efforts to curtail so-called “trans-national criminal organizations,” and fighting terrorism. The definitions give a pretty wide latitude for when these labels apply, though. When it comes to border security, drug smugglers and human traffickers generally occupy the same physical space as actors that don’t fall into those categories, such as illegal immigrants, too. Troops monitoring for the approved groups have the authority to report other suspicious individuals even if it isn’t their primary mission. The Big Miguel aircraft, which operated along the US border with Mexico under contract to the US Army some time during the 2011 fiscal year., US Army Still, per the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the federal military, or National Guard units acting under the direction of the federal government, cannot directly perform any actual law enforcement activities. The U.S. government generally understands this to mean that troops cannot actually arrest suspected criminals and that their participation otherwise in support of law enforcement activities does not automatically qualify as “executing the law” in violation of the statute. The sensitive legal nature of the issue does mean that JTF-N has to follow a number of steps to approve requests. The chart below shows the process, but here’s a slightly more simplified explanation of how this works. Law enforcement agencies can ask the task force for support that falls into one of the aforementioned categories, but they have to do so at least 180 days ahead of whenever they want the mission to start. The well defined process that law enforcement agencies have to go through to request support from JTF-N., JTF-N via FOIA Once JTF-N approves the request, the National Guard in the state in question then has the right to take on the mission itself, ask for additional federal support, or decline it entirely. In the latter two cases, the task force then solicits federal active and reserve military units to participate. With the help of their higher headquarters or senior service officials, those units then develop a plan of action and get it approved. Depending on the funding requirements or if there’s a need to waive the unit’s existing training and operational requirements, the final mission may need a sign-off from the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Money-wise, depending on the exact nature of the mission, the Pentagon decide to pull from its relatively small multi-million dollar budgets set aside for “counter-narcotics and global threats” or have the law enforcement organization reimburse the appropriate U.S. military component. All of these regulatory demands need to be met at least a month before the mission’s start date in order to allow for the unit to prepare and eventually deploy. After all that is in order, the military unit heads off to the border – or any other domestic location – to perform the task at hand. A snapshot of some of the laws and policies that apply to US military support to domestic law enforcement activities., JTF-N via FOIA Of course, ordering federal troops to the border through JTF-N isn’t the only option Trump has to get the military onto the border and it might not necessarily be the fastest. The U.S. military could find a legal justification to tap into its emergency construction budget to support work on the border wall or otherwise improve other border infrastructure, such as roads, observation posts, and the removal of obstructions that can block various surveillance systems. The Pentagon typically only asks for around $10 million in funding for that contingency construction account each year though, and Trump’s wall has an estimated price tag of at least $18 billion . The counter-drug and global threat line items are usually less than $1 billion annually, too, and that money supports a host of projects at home and abroad. Deploying large numbers of National Guard troops in a federal capacity might be another option, but it would be limited by the Posse Comitatus rules to performing the same kind of support missions JTF-N facilitates. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did just this for years as part of Operation Jump Start and Operation Phalanx , respectively, but weathered criticism that the efforts were overly expensive and ineffective, especially since the troops could not actually perform law enforcement activities. A UH-72A Lakota helicopter from the South Dakota Army National Guard, equipped with a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras and spotlight, ahead of a deployment in support of Operation Phalanx in 2013., South Dakota Army National Guard Governors can also use their own authority, based on state laws, to deploy the National Guard for such similar missions, but in many cases face the same sort of legal restrictions. Only under very specific legal authorizations can federal military personnel actually take on active law enforcement duties, typically to quell domestic unrest. There is always the possibility the U.S. military could look to reinforce the border protection mission indirectly by performing increased activities outside of the United States where there are different legal restrictions. Various branches already perform these sort of international counter-narcotics operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean and can do so even when operating from bases within the United States . Again, U.S. forces tasked with this missions focus primarily on aerial and land-based surveillance and reconnaissance activities, though they also conduct training and civil construction type activities. Regardless, it is still illegal for those forces to detain and arrest criminals though, and they have to work closely with the US Coast Guard , the State Department , federal law enforcement agencies, and foreign partners who do have that authority. But whatever legal and functional mechanisms the Trump administration might employ to put military personnel on the border, the truth is that they will be in addition to those that are already there and will continue to be in the future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 24, 2018",NASA Awards Contract To Lockheed’s Skunk Works To Build Manned Quiet Supersonic X-Plane,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Speed has never gone out of style, but efforts to prioritize it when it comes to flight sure has. But all that is changing on both commercial and military fronts. Maybe the biggest indication of this aeronautical revolution of sorts is NASA’s March 3rd, 2018 announcement that it is diving back into the manned x-plane game in a major way in the form of the Quiet Supersonic Transport, or QueSST, aircraft, which is part of the agency’s ambitious low-boom flight demonstration initiative. This piloted flying spike of an airplane will be built by Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works for a cool $247.5M and is scheduled to be delivered to Armstrong Flight Research Center by the end of 2021. This announcement is truly a glorious one for aerospace aficionados that have felt disillusioned by a promised supersonic air travel future that never really materialized. The one aircraft that did spend decades ferrying travelers at supersonic speeds, the Concorde , has been out of service for 15 years now, and exist as a page in aerospace history books and as museum pieces scattered around the western world. The NASA-Lockheed QueSST design., NASA NASA’s goal with this x-plane is to prove that supersonic flight doesn’t have to result in a thunderous booms heard on the ground—a key factor that doomed Concorde’s own business case. Currently supersonic flight over land is banned except for the military, and they can only fly supersonically under emergency circumstances or in designated and remote airspace. So any supersonic transport aircraft would have to throttle back to subsonic speeds during transits over the ground, that is unless they integrate new design technologies that the Low-Boom Demonstration is hopefully going to prove. The jet, which will be powered by a single General Electric F414 turbofan—the same engine used on the Navy’s Super Hornet—won’t just be used for collecting data over desolate test ranges. Instead NASA wants to fly it over populated areas so that its scientists can gain real-world data that can be used to evaluate the feasibility of constant operational supersonic travel over such locales. People’s perceptions of the audible signature of the jet as it flies over will be one data set that NASA is going to build during the QueSST’s trials. Decades worth or research and supersonic modeling techniques were used to come up with the Quiet Supersonic Transport or QueSST aircraft design. Here an updated version of “schlieren” photography that depicts the shockwaves that manifest around a T-38 Talon trainer during a supersonic dash., NASA The aircraft’s shape is supposed to keep shock waves from converging, and thus significantly lowering the audible signature of the aircraft as it travels at supersonic speed. In a press release, NASA stated : “The answer to how the X-plane’s design makes a quiet sonic boom is in the way its uniquely-shaped hull generates supersonic shockwaves. Shockwaves from a conventional aircraft design coalesce as they expand away from the airplane’s nose and tail, resulting in two distinct and thunderous sonic booms. But the design’s shape sends those shockwaves away from the aircraft in a way that prevents them from coming together in two loud booms. Instead, the much weaker shockwaves reach the ground still separated, which will be heard as a quick series of soft thumps – again, if anyone standing outside notices them at all. It’s an idea first theorized during the 1960s and tested by NASA and others during the years since, including flying from 2003-2004 an F-5E Tiger fighter jet modified with a uniquely-shaped nose, which proved the boom-reducing theory was sound. NASA’s confidence in the Low-Boom Flight Demonstration design is buoyed by its more recent research using results from the latest in wind-tunnel testing, and advanced computer simulation tools, and actual flight testing.” The Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration program utilized a highly modified F-5E., NASA As for the aircraft itself, it was largely designed as the result of a contract awarded to Lockheed in 2016 and will be 94 feet long while having a wingspan of just 29.5 feet. Its gross takeoff weight is set at 32,500lbs, which is akin to the unloaded and unfueled weight of an F-15E Strike Eagle. Once built, the craft is supposed to cruise at 55,000 feet and mach 1.42 or 940mph. This is about the same performance as an F-22 while executing a supercruise dash. It will top out at mach 1.5 and its cockpit configuration will be based on the rear cockpit of a T-38 Talon trainer. As you can see in the concept art, the pilot will have no forward view and will likely have to rely on instruments and a closed circuit video stream or a periscope-like arrangement for navigation. Once Lockheed’s own pilots check the jet out for safe flight, two NASA test pilots will take its reins for the test program. NASA’s pilots are already working with Lockheed on the cockpit layout and the simulators that will be used to train in preparation for the test flights. Jim Less is one of those pilots, and he is clearly excited to be part of what has become a rare aeronautical enterprise: “A supersonic manned X-plane! This is probably going to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. We’re all pretty excited… It’s pretty rare in a test pilot’s career that he can be involved in everything from the design phase to the flight phase, and really the whole life of the program.” Twitter Screencap NASA has progressively stepped away from building and flying manned x-planes due to a number of factors, with cost being a preeminent one. The agency has also put a larger focus on simulation and the use of unmanned sub-scale demonstration aircraft to achieve more limited flight testing goals. This is a far cry from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, when fleets of exotic NASA x-planes were highly active out of Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB. Quiet Supersonic Transport or QueSST model during wind-tunnel tests., NASA Clearly the stakes are quite high with this new x-plane program. Acoustically acceptable supersonic travel over land could revolutionize air travel and it comes at a time when supersonic transport aircraft are getting serious financial and corporate backing. Lockheed is now deeply involved with the Aerion Corporation who is aiming to build a supersonic business jet, and that aircraft, dubbed the AS2 could have big military applications as well. In fact, Lockheed seems to be situating itself in a particularly strategic position to potentially lead the supersonic air travel revolution. Lockheed and Aerion are working together to develop the AS2 supersonic business jet., Aerion As the company helps develops and build NASA’s pioneering x-plane, it will also be working on the AS2 which will have to be FAA certified. At the same time the Skunk Works is also pioneering new high-speed technologies in the defense realm, namely in the form of a hypersonic unmanned aircraft dubbed the SR-72 . Clearly these efforts will have synergistic properties that could give the company a huge leg up over potential high-speed aircraft competitors. Combining the experience from these separate but conceptually related projects in the mid to late 2020s could usher Lockheed back into the commercial aircraft prime manufacturer space—a sector it abandoned decades ago after the L1011 didn’t meet its financial goals. Before then there is a lot of work to do of course, with NASA laying out three major phases for its new x-plane initiative: “The program is divided into three phases and the tentative schedule looks like this: 2019 – NASA conducts a critical design review of the low-boom X-plane configuration, which, if successful, allows final construction and assembly to be completed. 2021 – Construction of the aircraft at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale is completed, to be followed by a series of test flights to demonstrate the aircraft is safe to fly and meets all of NASA’s performance requirements. The aircraft is then officially delivered to NASA, completing Phase One. 2022 – Phase Two will see NASA fly the X-plane in the supersonic test range over Edwards to prove the quiet supersonic technology works as designed, its performance is robust, and it is safe for operations in the National Airspace System. 2022 to 2025 – Phase Three begins with the first community response test flights, which will be staged from Armstrong. Further community response activity will take place in four to six cities around the U.S.” A NASA F-15B tested ‘Quiet Spike’ technology between 2006 and 2007., NASA We don’t know what cities NASA is eyeing and why for its supersonic test ground, or exactly how their populations will participate in the test flights. Yet one thing is for sure, having an entire city go outside and look up, while also listening carefully, as an exotic and potentially game changing experimental plane zips overhead at blistering speed is sure to become a pop culture phenomenon. It will also likely inspire a lot of young people who may be thinking about a career in STEM. Getting the American population involved with the program and making big headlines in doing so is an ingenious move by NASA who needs support from the American people for its various initiatives. Just as the old adage goes: ‘no bucks, no Buck Rodgers!’ It’s amazing to think that some 75 years after Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier in the X-1 we would still be trying to figure out how to make sustained supersonic air travel over land feasible. But better late than never, and above all else it’s truly exciting that NASA is back in the x-plane business in such a dramatic and captivating way.

According to Saudi Arabian Colonel Turki Al Maliki, the top spokesman for the coalition in Yemen, the attack came on April 3, 2018, but resulted in only superficial damage to the ship in question. At some point, a coalition warship intervened and accompanied the ship as it continued North in the Red Sea. He did not name the tanker or the warship involved and did not say whether or not the naval vessel had been escorting the commercial ship from the beginning. He also did not say what type of weapon the Houthis employed in this case. If the Saudi version of events is confirmed, this would be the second rebel attempt to damage or destroy commercial vessel since the beginning of the year. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Houthis attacked another tanker , but did not cause any damage. In that case, they reportedly used an unmanned, explosive filled boat. The group group have used these unmanned craft in a number of previous attacks and attempted attacks on naval vessels, including against the Saudi frigate Al Madinah near Al Hudaydah in 2017. The group has also used anti-ship missiles and sea mines to attack other coalition ships, as well as American warships in response to the U.S. government’s logistical support and other military aid to Saudi Arabia. After the January attack, Saleh Al Samad, the head of the Houthi government in Yemen, said the group might increasingly pursue “ strategic options ” in its fight against the Saudis and their partners. This threat included the possibility of “cutting off the Red Sea and international navigation,” he said in comments relayed through a visiting United Nations delegation. For years now, there have been concerns that the Houthis, or their various partners in Yemen , could become a serious threat to maritime trade in the region as the Saudi-led coalition stepped up its own campaign against the group and worked to more tightly encircle rebel-held areas. There have been sporadic reports of attacks on commercial ships, which may have been more criminal than military in nature, since at least 2016 . “We cannot rule out the possibility of Huthis [sic] attacking commercial shipping,” the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) noted in one infographic dated Oct. 10, 2016, a heavily redacted copy of which we at The War Zone previously obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. “Starting in early October 2016, there have been a series of reported attacks and advisories issued to the commercial maritime industry,” another ONI report from December 2016 added. An infographic showing the components of a capture Houthi drone boat that the Pentagon released as part of claims of increasing Iranian support for the rebels., DOD In addition to deliberate attacks on ships, military or commercial, the Houthis have also been employing improvised naval mines near the Mandeb Strait, a major trade route that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. These weapons pose a more indiscriminate threat and could help the group make good on Samad’s threat to impede “international navigation.” That being said, there is also a possibility that the rebels primary target was actually the escorting warship in this case. In the past, the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis have issued almost entirely contradictory statements about particular incidents and it can be difficult, if not impossible to independently verify the details. What we do know is that the Houthis do have access to anti-ship missiles , drone boats, and naval mines, among other increasingly advanced weaponry , and that they have been and still are a real threat military and commercial marine traffic in and around the Mandeb Strait. With continued and potentially increasing support from Iran, the group’s ability to launch stand-off attacks at sea and on land could further improve in the near term. An infographic showing coordinates found on the navigation computer on the captured Houthi drone boat, including ones in Iran., DOD In addition, the Houthis have also stepped up ballistic missile attacks against Saudi Arabia in recent months, as well as presenting an increasing challenge against Saudi-led coalition aircraft using surface-to-air missiles . In both cases, the Saudis, as well as the United States, have accused Iran of either supplying the rebels with those weapons or aiding in their local fabrication. However, attacks on international shipping could threaten to escalate the conflict into a broader regional issue if ostensibly neutral countries, such as the United States, decide to begin escorting commercial vessels through the area. The Houthis may be unable to readily discriminate between Saudi coalition and other foreign ships, or may simply see the increased military presence as implicitly supportive of Saudi Arabia’s campaign, as has been the case with American warships. Whatever the exact details of this latest incident are, it seems clear, at least so far, that any fears of prompting an even more ferocious Saudi response or provoking a wider conflict have not caused the Houthis to shy away from attacking ships in the area.

The aircraft was part of a detachment attached to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron One Six Two, or VMM-162, part of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which was in the East African country for the annual Alligator Dagger amphibious warfare exercise. Reports say that the aircraft’s nose appeared to rise rapidly as the plane lifted off from the runway, prompting the pilot to eject. The fate of the aircraft is unclear, but witnesses saw the pilot walk on their own to an ambulance after ejecting, according to USNI News. “Doctors said the pilot was in stable condition while being evaluated at Camp Lemonnier’s expeditionary medical facility,” the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which also acts as the top naval command in the Middle East, or Naval Forces Central Command (NAVCENT), said in a statement to USNI News. “There are no reports of injuries to personnel on the ground nor damage to infrastructure at the airport. The airport is open.” USMC Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti is the only formal U.S. military base in Africa and is home to more than 3,000 deployed personnel, as well as contractors and transient military units conducting training missions, such as Alligator Dagger, and other short-term operations.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Jun 18, 2018","The Army Now Wants Hypersonic Cannons, Loitering Missiles, And A Massive Supergun","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army is looking to develop a slew of new extended range artillery weapons to counter what it views as a growing imbalance in this regard with potential opponents, especially Russia . These new proposals include the addition of a hypervelocity or ramjet-powered projectile for existing cannons, a new quasi-ballistic missile with anti-tank and loitering munition payloads, an ultra long range “supergun,” and a potentially treaty-busting medium-range missile . Representatives from the service’s new so-called “cross functional team,” or CFT, for Long Range Precision Fires, or LRPF, described this potential mix of systems at the Association of the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in March 2018. In 2017, the Army announced plans to create eight CFTs within a new Futures Command, bringing together service members and subject matter experts to explore new technologies in a variety of different functional areas. In addition to LRPF, these include groups focused on developments relating to the Next Generation Combat Vehicle ; Future Vertical Lift ; Network Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence; Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing; Air and Missile Defense ; Soldier Lethality ; and the Synthetic Training Environment. “We’ve got to push the maximum range of all systems under development for close, deep and strategic, and we have got to outgun the enemy,” U.S. Army General Robert Brown, head of U.S. Army Pacific Command, said during a panel discussion at the Global Force Symposium. “We don’t do that right now; it’s a huge gap. … We need cannons that fire as far as rockets today. We need rockets that fire as far as today’s missiles, and we need missiles out to 499 kilometers.” At the same talk, U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian, head of the LRPF CFT, outlined how the service might be able to go about meeting that demand. Many of the systems he described initially are already in development to one degree or another. A slide from U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian’s presentation at the Global Force Symposium showing the ranges of various proposed and existing artillery weapons., US Army Extended-range howitzers The Army is already testing the XM1113 rocket-assisted, high-explosive 155mm shell. This will extend the maximum range of the service’s M777 towed howitzers and M109A6 and A7 self-propelled types from approximately 19 miles with existing rocket-boosted ammunition to some 25 miles. Maranian said that the new shells would begin reaching operational units in two and half years, though it’s not entirely clear why it will take so long. As noted, shorter range rocket-assisted projectiles are in service and this one has been in development for some time already. In addition, the latest M777 and M109 howitzers can already hit targets at 25 miles with the M982 Excalibur GPS-guided shell. There is also work underway to add a longer barrel cannon and more robust breech mechanism to the M777s and M109s in order to further push their maximum range all the way out to 43 miles. An auto-loader capability on either weapon could also further improve their capabilities, especially when coupled with a computer-assisted targeting system. This would allow artillery crews to rapidly fire a number of shells from a single weapon at a variety of points close together, with the rounds all falling in rapid succession, to saturate an enemy unit while giving them little time to react or seek cover. Many of these features were present on the Army’s abortive XM2001 Crusader self-propelled 155mm howitzer, which the service cancelled in 2002. These upgrades would put the weapons on par with Russia’s autoloader-equipped 152mm self-propelled 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV , which also has a range of approximately 43 miles. This weapon, which has been in some level of service since 2016, is one of many the Army is concerned about outranging their existing systems, which could allow them escape immediate counter battery fire during a potential conflict in Europe. The Army isn’t content to be on par with potential hostile forces, though. The goal is always to have a definitive “overmatch” in capabilities that gives American troops the edge. Railguns and ramjets So when it comes to cannon artillery in maneuver bridges, the service is hoping that rocket assisted rounds and longer barrel cannons will only be a prelude to more game-changing weapons. This Extended Range Cannon Artillery Program, or ECRA, is presently considering one of two options, either a hypervelocity projectile or a gun-launched, air-breathing ramjet-powered, quasi-missile. The Army is already experimenting with electro-magnetic railguns that can fire projectiles at hypersonic speeds, above Mach 6, and extremely aerodynamic projectiles that its conventional howitzers could be able lob at near hypersonic speeds. Units with a mobile, land-based rail gun might be able to effectively attack targets anywhere within an 80 to 100 mile radius – greater than that available with the Army’s existing 226mm guided artillery rockets – of their firing position and do so rapidly, accurately, and with little to no warning to the enemy. The speed and precision of a railgun mean that could be able to take on an anti-aircraft or counter rockets, artillery, and mortar mission in addition to a conventional artillery role. And without relying on chemical propellant charges, it would be able to do this with greater magazine depth and less strain on the Army logistics chain. A gun-launched ramjet-powered round could be capable of high supersonic speeds, as well, but might have the benefit of being able to independently maneuver after launch. This would allow for distributed attacks from numerous directions, which could confuse an enemy or otherwise disrupt their plans. General Atomics’ three mega joule railgun, called the Blizter, which the Army has been testing already., US Army The Precision Strike Missile In line with General Brown’s comments, with cannon artillery that can hit targets at the ranges of existing rockets, the Army is looking to push the range of those weapons to land-attack cruise and short-range ballistic missile ranges. There is an effort underway to extend the range of standard 226mm GPS-guided artillery rockets to approximately 75 miles. However, the big push is development program for what is now called as the Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM. Also known as DeepStrike , Raytheon is crafting this weapon as a replacement for the existing quasi-ballistic Army Tactical Missile System missile, or ATACMS . An infographic for Raytheon’s DeepStrike missile., Raytheon The PrSM will be able to strike targets just over 310 miles away – a very specific range we’ll come back to later on – nearly 125 miles greater than that of ATACMS. It will also be more accurate and smaller. This latter design decision means that two of the new missiles will be able to fit in the same space as a single one of the older types. As such, a truck-mounted High Mobility Artillery Rocket System ( HIMARS ) launcher will be able to carry two of the long-range weapons at once, while the tracked Multiple Launch Rocket System ( MLRS ) will be able to fire four before needing to reload. At present, the Army expects that a combination of manned battlefield surveillance and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft , drones , and space-based sensors will be able to provide the necessary targeting information for these weapons against both static and mobile targets. In the future, low-observable platforms, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , will be able to further extend that sensor range into denied areas. Land-based radars and artillery spotters on foot and in vehicles would continue in their traditional roles for the short-range cannon artillery. An artist’s conception of a wheeled HIMARS launcher firing a Precision Strike Missile., Raytheon Additional capabilities Beyond that, the service is interested in whether or not the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) itself, or a variant thereof, might be able to provide intelligence gathering capabilities, according to Brigadier General Maranian’s presentation. It’s not clear how this would exactly work, but it seems likely that the concept would involve a small drone payload in the missile. A weapon with a ballistic or quasi-ballistic trajectory does not otherwise lend itself to surveillance or reconnaissance duties. A single missile carrying some sort of reconnaissance payload might be able to act as a spotter for other missiles in denied, though, feeding them target information based on a set of baseline parameters. The U.S. Air Force is also exploring the potential of this concept of operations with regards to air-launched cruise missiles . A more robust sensor package could also just open up the possibility of adding a man-in-the-loop targeting capability that would allow for more precise adjustments during the weapon’s terminal phase, which can be especially useful for engaging moving targets. This provides additional time to abort an attack if it becomes apparent that innocent bystanders have entered the target area, as well, potentially reducing collateral damage . The video below describes the features of the Israeli Spike anti-tank missile family, which have a man-in-the-loop targeting capability. It might be able to turn the weapon into a loitering munition of sorts or the missile could carry smaller such systems that it could deploy over a target area. The Army says that by adding smart or loitering sub-munitions with some additional stand-off capability might be able extend the functional range of the weapon out an additional 125 miles or so. This would make HIMARS and MLRS launchers more capable than Russian extended range rocket artillery and their acknowledged ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles, such as Iskander-M , Iskander-K , and Bastion-P , the latter being officially an anti-ship missile, but having demonstrated a secondary land-attack capability in Syria. Perhaps more importantly, it could allow PrSMs to strike long-range integrated air defense positions with surface-to-air missile systems such as the S-300 and S-400 , which could limit the effectiveness of American or allied air power in the initial stages of a conflict. “Because of the power and range and the lethality of these Russian air defenses, it’s going to make all forms of air support much more difficult, and the ground forces are going to feel the effects,” Dr. John Gordon, a senior policy researcher from the think tank RAND and another member of the AUSA panel in March 2018, said. “It’s certainly going to put a premium on U.S. Army field artillery.” A slide from U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian’s presentation at the Global Force Symposium showing the service’s present and future fire support portfolio, including stand-off targeting capabilities., US Army Getting to ‘strategic’ range Air defenses, especially long-range radars and other sensor nodes that might even be able to spot low-observable aircraft in the future, are among the main drivers for the Army’s interest in new, weapons with what it calls “strategic range.” This would also be able to strike at base areas, hardened command centers, and other similar targets well behind the front lines in a high-end conflict. The two systems in question, the Strategic Strike Artillery Cannon and the Strategic Fire Missile, are also the least defined as of yet. The underlying issue, however, seems clear. Russia and the United States are party to a bilateral arms control agreement known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF . Despite its name, this deal prohibits either side from fielding conventional or nuclear-armed ground-launched cruise or ballistic missiles with maximum ranges anywhere from approximately 310 miles to 3,420 miles. The agreement forced both sides to retire a number of different weapon systems. It’s also why the PrSM’s planned range tops out at around 310 miles, since otherwise the weapon would be in violation of the INF. US Army Pershing II ballistic missiles, one of the systems banned under the INF., DOD The United States has publicly accused the Russians of being in violation of the treaty with ground-launched cruise missile system called the 9M729 or SSC-8 , which uses the same transporter-erector-launcher as the Iskander-M.  he Kremlin in turn denies that this weapon even exists. Using a loophole in the INF that allows for land-based missile research and development, the U.S. military has already begun studying the possibility of its own treaty-busting missile. The idea here is both to counter the capabilities of the SSC-8 and offer a potential bargaining chip to goad the Russians back into compliance with the agreement. We at The War Zone have already written in depth about the how such a negotiation might play out, which you can read here . The Strategic Fires Missile, though, sounds exactly like the system reportedly under study. The Army says that it this weapon would have a range between 310 and 1,400 miles, will within the limits the INF prohibits. At the Global Force Symposium in March 2018, Brigadier General Maranian suggested that this weapon would be INF-compliant, but it’s difficult to imagine how that could be the case. This would almost certainly require some creative legal interpretation of the deal. Perhaps the Army might look into whether a missile with a 310 mile maximum range that launches a second “air-launched” missile skirts the accepted definitions. Using Army watercraft as the launch platform might allow the service to avoid the “land-based label. Regardless of how it is configured, any such a weapon would be almost certainly to provoke complaints from Russian officials. In turn, it might make them feel vindicated in their decision to secretly abrogate the INF’s terms. Russia’s Iskander-M qausi-ballistic missile system., Vitaly Kuzmin A ‘supergun’ And this is where the Strategic Strike Artillery Cannon would come into the picture. The INF does not cover such weapons, regardless of their range. A cannon firing a chemically or electro-magnetically propelled round nearly 1,000 miles away could offer a way to strike targets well within denied areas, but in a way that is clearly compliant with the INF. The Army would actually have a surprisingly deep knowledge base to draw from in this regard, too. The service captured examples of the lesser known Nazi “ vengeance weapons ,” the V-3 long range gun , during World War II and extensive evaluated them afterwards. Then, during the 1960s, the United States and Canada teamed up on the High Altitude Research Project , or HARP, which used modified 16-inch naval guns from fixed sites on land to explore the possibility of the system as a cost-effective means of launching objects into space. Though that weapon set an attitude record for a gun-launched projectile, it was only 110 miles. It could serve as a good starting place for a larger “supergun,” though. The HARP gun’s designer, Gerald Bull, definitely thought so, shopping the idea of an ultra-long-range artillery weapon around the world after the project ended due to steadily improving rocket boosters and a loss of interest on the part of both the American and Canadian governments. The abandoned HARP gun on Barbados. , Brohav via Wikimedia Infamously, Bull finally pitched an improved concept to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in the 1980s. The Babylon Gun ’s design was supposed to offer a range of more than 450 miles, which would have put targets within Iran and Israel in strike distance. The final weapon never came to fruition though. Assassins, alternately linked to Israel’s Mossad or Iran’s VEVAK , killed Bull in the Belgian capital Brussels in 1990. British customs also seized components for the weapon before they could reach Iraq and the project came to a complete halt after the United States-led intervention to liberate Kuwait and beat back Iraqi forces in 1991. Bull’s concept for a multi-chamber artillery piece would still likely be one of the best chances for the Army to achieve the ranges it’s looking for with a gun system. The V-3 used a similar mechanism, with the Nazis referring to its multiple sections as a “high pressure pump” to cover its true function. These types of designs work by propelling a shell with multiple explosive charges. Combined with a long barrel, this method gradually builds up pressure behind the projectile just like a rocket, which extends range and reduces wear and tear on the system at the same time. Another option would be to pursue a larger railgun that might offer similar range. The conceptual design of the Army’s 32 mega joule electro-magnetic gun already requires two separate vehicles to carry the necessary power source and offers a maximum range of around 100 miles. A system with 10 times that range could have immense power requirements. Two sections of the Iraqi Babylon Gun that British customers officers seized, now on display at the Royal Armouries, Fort Nelson, Portsmouth., Geni via Wikimedia Strategic mobility It’s questionable how mobile either a chemical supergun or a massive railgun might be at all, though. Historically, plans for super guns have called for them to be fixed in place, aimed broadly in the direction of a large target, such as a city, intended to cause terror and chaos rather that than more specific strategic effects. The World War I-era Paris Gun could traverse 360 degrees, but was still effectively immobile, as were the guns the Germans and the British used to shell each other across the English Channel during World War II. The Strategic Strike Artillery Cannon might not need to move though. A fixed and properly hardened position could be able to hold a wide area at risk, which could deny an enemy freedom of movement through a large area. A slide from U.S. Army Brigadier General Stephen Maranian’s presentation at the Global Force Symposium showing an “operational view” of how the different artillery capabilities might work together., US Army This could be useful for trying to close of access to certain areas in a potential European conflict, especially in constrained multi-domain environments, such as the Baltic Sea or Black Sea . In those cases, various long range artillery weapons could work to neutralize anti-ship threats, as well as anti-aircraft ones, too. By the strategic weapons, missiles or guns, might actually be better suited to the Pacific theater, where being able to deploy them with any rapidity to small island outposts could easily present a significant challenge to other potential opponents, such as China or North Korea. These weapons would have the range to engage targets in North Korea from distributed sites in South Korea and Japan or various Chinese outposts in the South China Sea from territory belonging to allied or partner nations, such as The Philippines or Vietnam . If they were capable of firing hypersonic projectiles, the weapons in those positions would be even more effective, able to take on time-sensitive targets or otherwise launch strikes with little advance warning. This “an anti-access, area-denial capability all of our own to make potential adversaries think twice,” Brigadier General Maranian explained. They would “be deterred before making a decision of whether cost is worth the benefit of being provocative.” A broader, joint-service approach A Strategic Fires Missile with a mobile transport-erector-launcher could use the decks of amphibious ships as a firing platform, as well. In that regard, it’s very likely that the U.S. Marine Corps might be interested in a variety of the artillery systems the Army is proposing, including the PrSM, which would fit in that service’s HIMARS launchers, as well. Interest from the Marines, or even from other services such as the U.S. Navy in related technologies such power sources for electro-magnetic guns, could help reduce the burdens on the Army both in terms of cost and other resources, too. This could be particularly important given the obviously ambitious concepts the service’s artillery-focused cross-functional team is considering and their apparent desire to make as many of them a reality as possible in as short a time frame as they can. The Navy is itself looking to the Army and Marines for help with its own railgun program . That service is now pushing to field hypervelocity projectiles that will work with 155mm howitzers and five-inch naval guns, by only fly at speeds up to Mach 3, rather than Mach 6 or above. The Navy’s multi-weapon Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) concept. , USN The Army definitely doesn’t feel it has any time to lose in fielding new weapons. “The Russians take this stuff seriously; artillery has been the strong suit of the Russian Army since the days of the czars,” Gordon, the RAND researcher, who recently conducted a study on Russia’s capabilities for officials at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, the home of the Army’s main artillery school, said. The service expects to begin testing the PrSM in 2019 and have the new, longer range conventional howitzers ready by 2023. With the aggressive schedule driven by existing, potential threats, Maranian’s cross functional team will have to begin fleshing out its concepts for the more advanced weapons soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 26, 2018",General Atomics Isn’t Building A Flyable Prototype Of Their MQ-25 Tanker Drone,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. General Atomics, purveyor of the iconic Predator and Reaper drones, has officially released more concept art and new details about its carrier-based tanker drone to our friend and Aviation Week reporter James Drew. One main revelation in Drew’s report is that the company doesn’t plan on actually building a full-scale prototype of its design, at least not until they win the competition. Instead General Atomoics will use its existing Predator-C/Avenger , on which their MQ-25 concept is based, for limited ground handling tests. This will include testing gesture recognition software that will allow the unmanned craft to taxi around the carrier’s deck without a person controlling it in the traditional sense. They will also build a full-scale engine test stand that will include a model of the aircraft’s inlet design, all part of an initiative to prove to the Navy that their MQ-25 is a low risk choice. It doesn’t look much like its animal namesake, but General Atomics’ MQ-25 ‘Stingray’ does appear exactly like what we have seen in past renderings . It also adheres to what General Atomic’s told The War Zone directly last February, that their engineers used dynamic modeling software to dramatically alter the ‘Sea Avenger’ concept into the MQ-25 Stingray we see today, an aircraft that is tailored to the Navy’s tanker requirements. Sea Avenger was designed out of the Avenger for the now defunct Unmanned Carrier Launched Surveillance And Strike (UCLASS) program that predated the dumbed down tanker requirement we now know as the MQ-25 ‘Stingray’ Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS). The original Sea Avenger concept was built for penetrating reconnaissance and strike. Still, the concept closely resembles the company’s MQ-25 entrant, albeit it looks far less athletic and has sacrificed its low-observable features for utility and simplicity. , General Atomics So basically what we have here is a ballooned Sea Avenger of sorts with a new, more traditional wing. And it is a very promising looking concept as it appears virtually every aspect of its design has been modified to add internal fuel volume. This makes plenty of sense considering the MQ-25 has to pass at least 14,000lbs of fuel—roughly the equivalent of an F/A-18E’s internal fuel capacity—to receiver aircraft operating some 500 miles from the carrier and still have enough gas to return to recover in this ship safely. General Atomics had high hopes for the Avenger concept that balanced stealth and performance against affordability, but has yet to receive a major order for the type: https://youtube.com/watch?v=v0dHKWjXn-E The renderings also show the aircraft fitted with two hardpoints, one for the Cobham refueling pod and the other with an external tank. Various antennas protrude from the airframe as well, and an electro-optical sensor ball is seen protruding from under the forward fuselage. This is a feature that is planned on all three MQ-25 entrants, providing an austere surveillance capability. Additional space for a surface-search radar or a radar pod is also likely to be common about feature on all of the competitors designs. According to what General Atomics told The War Zone , their design may even feature more gas carrying capability than what is required as it was stressed to us by program manager Chuck Wright that substantial ‘margin’ was built into their MQ-25 design. This is also reflected in James Drew’s report, in which he writes: “In an exclusive interview with Aviation Week in mid-March, GA-ASI President David Alexander expressed confidence that the company’s proposal for MQ-25 will exceed the Navy’s performance requirement for fuel offload and range, as well as the objective delivery schedule.” The company’s push to optimize their MQ-25 entrant for the tanker mission also includes a far more powerful engine than the current Avenger flies with. In early February, the company announced that it had selected the Pratt and Whitney PW815 turbofan to propel its MQ-25. The company says the engine was chosen due to a special focus on reliability and supportability, stating in a release that “the PW815 was intentionally designed with availability in mind. It is designed to be the easiest engine in its thrust class to access and maintain.” The PW815 will be configured to produce 16,000lbs of thrust for General Atomics’ MQ-25, four times that of the Avenger’s existing PW545B powerplant, according to the Aviation Week article. Compared to Lockheed’s more exotic flying wing MQ-25 design , and Boeing’s similar but more streamlined and still somewhat stealthy design (a byproduct of its UCLASS roots), General Atomics’ entrant appears to be a big flying gas truck that seems to attempt to meet the Navy’s requirements in the most straightforward way possible. Even though the company won’t produce a flyable prototype—a risk-reduction decision Lockheed has made as well—their MQ-25 is once again based on the Avenger drone which has been flying now for nearly a decade. It even spent time in Afghanistan, although its operations there remain shrouded in secrecy. As a result, each competitor has a different situation when it comes to having a physical representation of their design or not. General Atomics MQ-25 concept art. , General Atomics Boeing remodeled an existing prototype that was built for the UCLASS program in 2014, before it was watered down into a tanker requirement. Still, it is a physical specimen that is supposedly capable of flight. There is also talk that Boeing’s Phantom Works may be working on a second prototype that will be more representative of their final design iteration. Boeing’s MQ-25 prototype. We have no concept art depicting their final MQ-25 configuration from the company. , Boeing Phantom Works Lockheed’s Skunk Works on the other hand shows no indication that they are planning on building anything physical at all when it comes to their flying-wing MQ-25 entrant. Instead the company’s pedigree with unmanned flying-wings , which dates back more than two decades, could help bolster the case for their ‘paper’ but still impressive MQ-25 design. Concept art showing Lockheed’s flying-wing MQ-25 design., Lockheed Skunk Works General Atomics’ MQ-25 situation is a hybrid of the two—they have a flying and proven version of the aircraft that their MQ-25 is based off of. But that aircraft is two iterations removed from the much heavier and beefier MQ-25 derivative and is in no way hardened for the harsh carrier operating environment. Beyond that, the company is only going to build an engine test mockup that will include the design’s overhead air inlet. This will help eliminate risk for a number of critical aircraft components, but it’s a far cry from producing an actual aircraft prototype. It’s worth noting that the MQ-25 tender does not require competitors to put forward a flying prototype, but the Navy is not prone to taking very high developmental risks with its tactical aircraft fleet. The more risk reduction work a contender has done the better they are likely to be off. This is especially true considering the longevity of the MQ-25 program may be somewhat in doubt and major cost and timetable overruns that occur after the contract is awarded could sink the program fully. The fact that General Atomics isn’t going to rollout an actual prototype is somewhat surprising to me, as during my interview with the company’s project manager I got the impression that this was indeed the plan. Maybe things changed or maybe the engine test stand was deemed enough of a prototype going forward. Cost is also likely to be a major factor when it comes to which of the three companies will get a shot at building four early development prototypes after being awarded the contract this summer. There is no denying that General Atomics has large scale series production of unmanned aircraft down. Predator, Reaper and Avenger photography at the company’s Grey Butte drone plant. , General Atomics The firm has built hundreds of Predator, Reaper, and Gray Eagle drones , as well as other derivatives of those designs, over the last couple decades. The same cannot be said for Boeing. And even though Lockheed has been very active clandestinely in the tactical unmanned aircraft space, and at least one of their unmanned platforms, the RQ-170 Sentinel , did enter into limited production, it doesn’t compare to the scale of output that General Atomics has realized. What General Atomics’ team lacks for the MQ-25 competition is experience in naval aviation, but the company was able to lock down Boeing as a subcontractor to help them with just that if they win the Stingray contract. This was a genius move on behalf of General Atomics that once again alleviates risk and gives the Navy piece of mind that Boeing’s long-running carrier-borne aviation experience will be injected into the MQ-25 whether they pick Boeing or General Atomics. The Avenger is thought to cost around $15M per aircraft. The super-sized MQ-25, which will be a more complex, heavier, and hardier aircraft will certainly cost much more. Yet the fact that the company can deliver an aircraft like Avenger at that price is a good sign. We have no idea what an RQ-170 or any other flying-wing drones Lockheed has secretly developed have cost. Boeing’s MQ-25 design is a total question mark in the cost department as well. The renderings we have seen from both General Atomics and from Lockheed may put into question Boeing’s prototype’s ability to carry enough gas to meet the Navy’s requirements. Since it was designed originally to meet the UCLASS requirements, it’s possible that it doesn’t meet the MQ-25 requirements fully. If that is the case it should be viewed as a technology demonstrator more than an actual prototype. This could be why Boeing is potentially moving ahead with building another prototype that better reflects their final MQ-25 configuration. Even the aircraft’s buried inlet—a fairly exotic and potentially troublesome low-observable feature—is worthless when it comes to meeting the MQ-25’s fairly basic survivability requirements. General Atomics is the little guy in the MQ-25 fight—everything is relative in the world of big defense right? They are going up against the two largest aerospace defense contractors in the United States, which may be intimidating but it could actually be a blessing, at least according to David Alexander, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems’ President, who told James Drew the following: “We are the rapid-capability company when you look at this competition, and being privately held is a big piece of that… Those big corporations can have deep pockets when they want to, but they don’t typically move quick, like we do. Our agility, to move quick and be focused, gives us a competitive edge.” Now that all three competitors’ cards are largely on the table, we will probably get better defined metrics for each proposal in the not so distant future, as well as individual claims of superiority over the competition. But clearly General Atomics has put forward a no-nonsense flying fuel truck that includes some serious risk reduction work, not to mention benefiting from years of flight experience from its inspiration, the Avenger. Four years ago I wrote the following when detailing Avenger’s merits and predicted that the Navy may find its straight forward and less risky design as attractive for the then still active UCLASS bid which was already being degraded by Navy officials: “General Atomics’ no-frills approach to the low observable, jet powered, unmanned combat air vehicle may actually help when it comes to the Navy’s looming Unmanned Carrier Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) bid. This program is the Navy’s first attempt at integrating an operationally relevant advanced combat drone into its carriers’ air wings. Originally it was expected to require a deep penetrating, high subsonic, bat-winged, state of the art design, but now it seems more like its requirements were written based on the Avenger’s sales brochure, with a greater focus on cost, surveillance, endurance, rudimentary capabilities like acting as an aerial tanker, and reliability than deep interdiction against an enemy with an advanced air defense network. Thus General Atomics’ “Sea Avenger,” an outgrowth design of the baseline Avenger airframe, which was the dark horse in the contest originally, may be poised to take the prize.” Now that the Navy’s carrier-based drone program has been reduced to satisfy almost entirely the tanker mission, those words continue to ring eerily true.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Feb 6, 2019",‘Like Playing a Video Game’: Carrier Crew Flies Hornet Through Touch-and-Gos Remotely,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The flight deck crew of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier has remotely controlled an F/A-18 Hornet through a series of touch-and-gos at sea for the first time using a specialized system known as the Aircraft Terminal Approach Remote Inceptor, or ATARI. The service may eventually give all of its flattops this same capability, which would be invaluable in the event of an in-flight emergency or poor weather and could also serve as an alternate means of recovering unmanned aircraft in the future. In March 2018, the Landing Signal Officers on board the USS Abraham Lincoln used ATARI to maneuver a Hornet with a pilot inside from the “Salty Dogs” of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) through a standard recovery procedure. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) first began testing the system on land in 2016 using a modified Learjet, before installing the necessary equipment in some of VX-23’s F/A-18s the following year. “The [sea state] conditions were really varsity [difficult], and it was really impressive the system worked the way it did. On a calm day, it would have been a little bit boring, but this was definitely more challenging,” U.S. Navy Lieutenant John Marino, a VX-23 pilot who flight tests systems for carrier suitability, said after the March 2018 event. “Back on the airfield, testing was benign.” Landing on board an aircraft carrier is demanding at the best of times and is a skill set that requires pilots train and re-qualify regularly to reduce the possibility of potentially deadly accidents. When the ship’s deck it pitching up and down several feet and rolling from side to side, possibly at night , it only requires more attention to detail. A Landing Signal Officer, at left, stands behind the ATARI system on board the USS Abraham Lincoln. , USN True to its acronym, the components of ATARI on the carrier consist of a joystick and other controls and monitors to observe the aircraft’s flight path. It’s not clear from the Navy’s description whether the system uses a line-of-sight link or leverages the longer range data links on the aircraft itself. We also don’t know whether or not it takes a video feed from cameras on the plane itself or uses sensors on the ship to determine the appropriate glidescope and lineup position, or both. Whatever the case, the aircraft is fully under the command of the Landing Signal Officer during the process. “You’re effectively using little joystick controllers to guide a 40,000 pound airplane, and it’s almost like you’re playing a video game,” Buddy Denham, the NAVAIR engineer responsible for creating ATARI told the service’s reporters after the test flights. The Navy says that the system is not supposed to be a replacement for pilots landing manually, but rather as an emergency backup. During the test the deck crew waved off the pilot three times to ensure the conditions were safe enough for the Landing Signal Officer to take over. But given the inherently complicated nature of recovering aboard an aircraft carrier, having the system in place could be especially useful in a number of situations. Perhaps the most obvious scenario is a battle damaged single-seat fighter jet returning the carrier from a combat mission with a wounded pilot who may not be physically capable or even fully conscious enough to put the plane down on the deck. Ditching or ejecting into the water may not be an option either in that case, since the aviator might not be capable of employing their survival gear before rescue personnel can get to them. Being able to put the aircraft on the deck would be both safer and speed up the process of getting the individual potentially life-saving medical attention. An F/A-18E Super Hornet from VX-23 catches the wire at the Runway Arrested Landing Site in Lakehurst, New Jersey., USN Unfortunately, there are an increasing number of non-combat situations where a carrier might benefit from having ATARI on board. The Navy’s Hornet and Super Hornet fleets in particular, as well as the related EA-18G Growler community, have been experiencing high incidences of hypoxia-like symptoms for years and the service continues to struggle to find the root cause or causes. Hypoxia is a significant drop, or halt altogether, of oxygen reaching the brain, which can lead to headaches, confusion and disorientation, blackouts, and even death. A pilot suffering for any of this while operating from an airfield shore is bad enough, but would be made even more dangerous when combined with trying to land on board a moving aircraft carrier at sea. On top of that, these same types of aircraft have experienced a number of freak and potentially deadly accidents relating to their environmental control systems. In January 2018 , the two-man crew of an EA-18G had to use their smart watches and the verbal guidance of personnel on the ground in order to make it back to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington state after the cockpit temperature plunged to -30 degrees Fahrenheit, icing over their instruments and the insides of the canopy. ATARI would give the ship’s crew another way to intervene in these sorts of emergencies. The system could also be a boon on land, too, for the same reasons. It might also just help in instances of pilot fatigue. Along with ATARI, NAVAIR has been testing another system called Magic Carpet that helps reduce the workload on pilots landing on an aircraft carrier by suggesting appropriate course changes. An F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to VX-23 touches down on the USS George H.W. Bush during a test of Magic Carpet in 2015., USN This also helps reduce the instances of having to send out a recovery tanker – an F/A-18E/F Super Hornet with a buddy refueling store – to give the aircraft extra gas in order to make additional landing attempts. Having to wave off and circle around again can be grueling and giving an aircraft carrier’s crew the option of stepping in and getting the aircraft down could be important in extreme cases. Navy aircraft already have Instrument Carrier Landing System (ICLS) and the Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) as on board aids to help in recovering safely, especially in inclement weather. ACLS is a “hands off” system, as well, but does not involve crew on the carrier flying the aircraft remotely. However, ACLS, which relies on a dedicated radar on the carrier to provide course correction information, reportedly lacks the precision necessary to work by itself in all cases. In approximately 20 to 40 percent of ACLS-assisted recoveries, the pilot still needs to take over and make the final adjustments before landing. As such the service hopes to begin replacing both ICLS and ACLS with improved and more accurate Joint Precision Approach & Landing Systems (JPALS), which uses GPS-enabled position information, starting in 2019. ATARI could still provide an important backup system for JPALS in the scenarios we’ve already noted. With the Navy planning to add MQ-25 Stingray tanker drones to its carrier air wings in the coming years, ATARI could take on an important role as part of the ship’s unmanned carrier aviation control architecture. From what we know now, each flattop will get a dedicated control suite and the pilotless aircraft themselves will be capable of semi-autonomous flight, including take-offs and landings. Without a pilot on board, if the ship loses control or the drone’s own flight computer malfunctions, ATARI would be another possible alternative means of regaining control and getting the unmanned aircraft back home in one piece. In that way, the system reflects the service’s need to adjust how it expects to operate if it wants to incorporate the MQ-25 or any other carrier-launched pilotless planes fully into the carrier air wing. “We don’t have unmanned carrier-based vehicles in the fleet today, but they are coming soon,” Dan Shafer, a NAVAIR air vehicle engineer, said after the tests on Lincoln . “This is a potential alternative landing method and our [ATARI] system performed well.” One of Northrop Grumman’s X-47B Umanned Combat Air System Demonstrator ( UCAS-D ) drones lands on the USS George H.W. Bush for the first time in 2013., USN Of course, ATARI won’t likely be a perfect remedy in any of these situations. In a real emergency, the Landing Signal Officers might not have the benefit of multiple passes before they can be confident in their ability to set the aircraft in question down safely or at least have it take the barrier. They might still call for a stricken pilot to ditch or eject for fear of causing a greater catastrophe on the flight deck . Depending on its configuration, failures in the command links between the system and the plane heading back to the carrier are a potential issue that could similarly render ATARI non-functional. In a crisis, satellite linkages are increasingly vulnerable to hostile interference , as well as enemy forces outright attacking space-based assets. But if ATARI doesn’t rely on satellite links, it could be especially useful in a GPS-denied environment and might be the only option for getting drones that rely on satellite navigation back on the ship. It could also be an important substitute for the GPS-dependent JPALS, as well. VX-23 conducted the flight tests in March 2018 amid routine carrier qualifications on the ship and the data NAVAIR collected will go toward refining the system. At present, the Navy does not intend to install the ATARI control components on any other aircraft carriers beyond Lincoln . Still, more options are inherently better than not. With this successful experiment in hand, the Navy could one step closer to giving all of its aircraft carriers the ability to land returning aircraft by remote control.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jul 17, 2024",A Definitive Audit Of How Many Weapons Doug Masters Launched From His F-16 In Iron Eagle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The ’80s air combat yarn Iron Eagle holds a unique place in military themed movie history. It was totally overshadowed by Top Gun , which came out five months after Iron Eagle. At the same time it introduced the world to the F-16, which was still a fresh and innovative face on the fighter scene. Although filled with some striking aerial footage and set to a pumping rock soundtrack, the movie was about as cliche filled as possible. It followed the popular ‘super kids’ movie trope of the era and was laughably far fetched. But even above the corny dialogue and cheesy premise, the movie maybe best known for its chaotic editing and representation that the relatively svelte F-16A/B carried seemingly unlimited firepower. Among defense and aviation enthusiasts, the ‘bottomless’ Fighting Falcon seems to be the biggest thing that stands out from the movie—that and the fact that Israeli F-16s stood in for USAF models, and the MiGs were Israeli Kfirs. The backstory there is that the USAF would not support a film that featured a kid stealing an F-16 and using it to bomb another country. As such the IAF was willing to take on the job but on the condition that its involvement remained unpublicized, which in itself was a whole other seemingly pointless saga. In the end the movie’s aerial and ground sequences involving the F-16 were shot in Israel, with Ramat David Air Base being the prime filming location. The majority of the footage of the fictional “Beech AFB” was captured at Camarillo Airport in California. The mix of locations actually worked out surprisingly well. Iron Eagle screencap via IMDB Back to Iron Eagle’s notorious depiction of F-16s with unlimited magazine depth, although this issue seems to have grated many viewers the most, along with a seemingly endless number of easily avoidable editing goofs, some would argue that it’s a fictional movie and that none of these issues impact the plot anyway. That may be true, but conversely, making it more believable and accurate would not impact the plot negatively either, so why not just try and make it as accurate as possible? Doing so wouldn’t even have cost anything extra. Yes, Doug Masters’ girlfriend was Jan Levinson from The Office. , Iron Eagle screencap via IMDB But then again, does Iron Eagle really deserve its reputation for an outlandish portrayal of the F-16’s capabilities? We decided to find out by tallying up all the different weapons used during the various combat sequences depicted in the film. The movie is filled with all types of conflicting statements and footage regarding the F-16’s weapons fit, but here is a basic breakdown of the munitions involved: Four primary weapons are featured in the film. A 30mm cannon is mentioned and shown on the aircraft’s stores management display. This seems to be confused with the jet’s actual 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon and the GEpod30 30mm cannon system that was being marketed at the time for the F-16 at the time. In the movie this pod isn’t seen but it is briefly mentioned. During all the firing sequences it shows the jet’s internal 20mm firing, but all the displays read 30mm. Regardless, let’s assume they just meant the jet’s internal cannon. Iron Eagle screencap The AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile is featured heavily and is portrayed basically in an accurate manner superficially speaking. When it comes to bombs, things get more confusing. The bombs carried are clearly Mk82 500lb ‘slicks,’ but they are referred to as ‘clusters’ and ‘Mark 82s’ verbally. At the same time, the jet’s fictional stores display calls them ‘weasils’ which seems like a cool name they assigned the bombs in production, but did they did not follow through with using the moniker during filming. The stores screen on Doug’s F-16B during the mission to rescue his dad., Iron Eagle Screencap The jet’s only air-to-air missile is the AIM-9 Sidewinder, which is used correctly in the movie, aside from in one scene. At the time, the F-16’s only air-to-air missile was indeed the Sidewinder, so this is accurate. It wasn’t till three years later that the first F-16A/B Block 15 ADF was introduced, which gave the F-16 AIM-7 Sparrow capability. Finally we have the ‘Hades Bomb,’ a fictional wide-area fire bomb of sorts used to create a set-piece during the movie’s climactic action sequence. Doug’s training mission During the single training mission Doug flew with Chappy before the veteran colonel decided to commit a whole series of high crimes and potentially start a war with another country in order to execute a laughably poor plan to save Doug’s dad from execution, here’s what was fired off the F-16B: 2X bombs/weasils Then Chappy says to try again with a “mark 82.” The weapons stores display then shows two Sidewinders coming off the jet and impacting the ground—so stupid editing error, but still two more weapons fired. 2X Sidewinders (supposed to be mk82s/Weasils) Then a defiant Doug—the 18 year old Cessna pilot that has been secretly flying F-16s with his Air Force officer dad—says he is doing it his way. He kicks on his knee-board mounted tape player and makes another run with the tunes blaring. 2X bombs/weasils come off the jet Many more explosions are shown than weapons we see being fired, at one time two bombs cause five huge explosions on the ground for instance, but we are sticking with what we see physically fired. So total for the practice run is six weapons, but probably about 10 explosions. Still, nothing here is totally absurd believability wise. On the mission before Chappy goes down The jets are shown being launched with three Mk82s, two AGM-65 Mavericks, two AIM-9 Sidewinders, and one jet has the fictional red-cased Hades bomb on its centerline as well. Now the mission to save Doug’s dad, with the help of extended montage sequences showing the “Eagles” club of super kids ripping off the Air Force and stealing all types of classified information from their officer parents, is underway. On their way into enemy country (after flying thousands from the United States?) and after Doug aerial refuels for the first time, this is what his stores management screen looks like: Iron Eagle Screencap The numbers on the stores screen don’t reflect what we see being carried, and it shows a fuel state of 6,972lbs—the F-16B actually holds 5,700lbs internally—and 500 rounds of ammunition. In reality the F-16 holds 511 rounds, so pretty close there. Before the first battle begins, Chappy tells Doug he has “four clusters” and to use “foil packs” to confuse “French radar.” Then, once the first battle kicks off, here is what is launched off both F-16s: 2X bombs/weasils 1X Sidewinder An estimated 8-10 seconds of cannon fire. The M61 cannon fires at 6,000 rounds per minute, meaning about 100 rounds per second. So the entire 500 round load would be spent in about five to six seconds (70rpm for first second as gun spools up). Between two F-16s this engagement is believable stores-wise. Once again, we aren’t counting explosions here as weapons dropped. Doug on his own Once Chappy gets hit and heads out to the Mediterranean (where there is always an Egyptian Trawler nearby as per ’80s military action movie conventions) Doug is left on his own to continue the rescue mission. During which he listens to a tape from Chappy where the colonel tells him to keep an eye on his stores screen—good but unheeded advice for the Iron Eagle production team as well! The final action sequence includes the following weapons being fired from Doug’s jet alone: 2X AGM-65 Mavericks 8X bombes/weaseils 1X Hades bomb Roughly 15 seconds of 20mm gun fire. This is the sequence that most cite as so horribly outlandish, but aside from the gratuitous explosions and unrealistic use of the jet’s cannon, it’s not as crazy as it seems. We are talking about roughly 6,000lbs of ordnance here, which the F-16 could easily carry into battle, albeit it wouldn’t be that nimble doing so until after it was released. Still, Doug has used basically three times the amount of ammunition his jet carries for its 20mm cannon in this part of the mission alone, but this isn’t really an Iron Eagle problem. Virtually every action movie of the era featured seemingly endless magazines for all types of small arms and machine guns. Just take a second and try to remember how the 9mm Uzi alone was portrayed in ’80s movies—ridiculously powerful and of unlimited ammunition. As Masters fights his way towards the Mediterranean with his dad now onboard and his low fuel state and weapons situation becoming a factor, he tells his dad he has 3,015lbs of fuel, two Sidewinders, and 244 rounds of ammo left. Here is his weapons status screen at this point, note that it also shows two bombs/weasils left: A largely accurate stores screen, although according to this Doug still has two bombs left too. , Iron Eagle Screencap He then goes onto expend the following during air-to-air combat: 1X Sidewinder Five seconds of gun firing Then in the nick of time, a flight of USAF F-16s approaches from the north and scares off the remaining two enemy jets. Doug then asks to lead the ‘missing man formation’ in remembrance of Chappy (who is alive, remember Egyptian trawlers are everywhere in the ’80s) as they head to the tanker. It’s maybe the cheesiest scene in the whole movie, and that’s saying something. Tristar Pictures via IMDB But when you break it all down, Iron Eagle’s magically armed F-16s really aren’t all that magical at all. Sure their capabilities are embellished a bit, but not much more than any other movie of the era. So Iron Eagle really isn’t as deserving of criticism it has received in this unique regard. What makes the portrayal of the F-16’s capabilities feel so much more unbelievable than they actually are are the conflicting claims and editing mistakes that infest the movie. That paired with a laughably stupid plot and super cheesy dialogue, along with a rich helping of popular movie tropes of the decade, makes the viewer want to actively pick apart the film’s technical stumbles. The “Eagles Club” of teenage Air Force brats that fly planes and have seemingly total access to the USAF’s most critical data, fill the ’80s movie trope of ‘super kids’ to an almost satirical degree in the movie. But Iron Eagle is all about being over-the-top. How can’t it be with such a ludicrous plot?, Iron Eagle screencap via IMDB But even with these issues, and after being enormously overshadowed by Top Gun , the Iron Eagle became a cult classic and led to no less than three progressively more outlandish and lower budget sequels. After watching the movie again, now in HD, it was a lot of fun even though I have seen it probably 30 times before. In fact, the whole ‘super kids’ element and relatively awesome ’80s soundtrack really works better now than it had in past two decades as ’80s nostalgia-focused entertainment is very hot right now. See Stranger Things for proof. Iron Eagle movie cover via Letterboxd.com In essence, now the whole movie actually plays out like a satire of itself, with its melodrama seemingly totally comedic. And although HD shows even more flaws and low-budget production choices, the aerial sequences look great. So yeah, the movie is still stupid, but the whole unlimited weapons gripe is actually far less severe than it is has been made out to be. And I for one still love this movie. It, along with Airwolf and Top Gun and so many other shows and films from the period, were a huge influence on me growing up, so it’s fun to revisit them and reminisce.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 29, 2017",Russia’s New Little Missile Packing Patrol Ship Is A Pretty Genius Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia is constructing half a dozen Project 22160 patrol boats that leverage an innovative and compact design that provides a lot of capability and potentially a huge amount of combat punch in a relatively small seaframe. The concept is innovative enough that it should be studied by western navies as a source of inspiration for their own future multi-role combat vessels. Displacing just 1,300 tons, and at 308 feet long, these vessels sport stealthy features and have a range of 6,000 miles. They can stay at sea for 60 days while housing a crew complement of approximately 80 people. They aren’t slowpokes either and can hit speeds of up to 30 knots. The class was designed with a slew of missions in mind, including everything from anti-piracy to counter-terrorism, and even strike and special operations support. But above all else they are sea control vessels capable of blue water operations just as much as brown water operations. Russia MoD They pack a 57mm А-220М automatic deck gun, a pair of DP-65 grenade launchers, as well as two 14.5mm guns. A Gibka air defense missile turret that can hold up to 12 Igla surface-to-air point defense missiles is also destined to equip these ships. Gibka point defense turret., Rosoboronexport The system’s infrared and telescopic TV sensors can also be used for surveillance. TK25 and PK10 countermeasure systems help protect the vessel from threats above and below the sea, as well. The small ship also features a sizable flight-deck and a somewhat unique semi-recessed hangar bay that can accommodate a medium multi-purpose helicopter like the KA-27/28/29. This gives the ship a over-the-horizon surveillance, strike, and search and rescue capability. In addition to navigational sensors, the patrol ship’s primary sensor system is the Pozitiv-ME1 3D active surface and air search radar, which has a range against fighter sized targets of about 75 to 100 miles. The latest compact active and passive sonar systems are also carried along with a pair of rigid hull inflatable boats that flank each side of the ship’s forecastle. These can be used for delivering boarding parties, as tenders, and for other duties. But the most interesting part of the concept is an expansive garage-like area below the helicopter deck where two containers can be fitted under overhead swinging doors. This space is flexible and could be used for everything from extra living space for crew or special operations personnel, to launching and recovering small boats and underwater or surface unmanned craft, and/or even for fitting a containerized drone control center. But the space’s primary purpose is to house containerized long-range weapons. A similar concept is being built into Russia’s icebreaking patrol ships intended for arctic operations, but in the case of the Project 22160 ships, containerized Klub-N anti-ship and land attack cruise missiles will be the class’s primary armament. Other containerized missiles can be switched in and out over time as well. Basically, this gives these relatively small combat vessels the option to take along a credible long-range anti-ship and land attack capability, with the ability to field eight missiles at once in two canisters. Alternatively one canister can be housed with the extra space used for other operations. A pretty capable little ship right? But Russia is buying the base model. The enhanced version of the Project 22160 class also features a Shtil-1 vertical launch missile system between the bridge and the deck gun packing between a dozen and two dozen 9M317ME missiles. Based on advanced derivatives of the SA-11 Buk system, this gives these little ships an area air defense capability, allowing them to protect convoys of vessels and localized areas from air-breathing threats. The missiles have a range of roughly 30 miles and are very loosely analogous to block I version of NATO’s RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile . Almaz-Antey This additional capability would be packed into a vessel displacing roughly 1,700 tons. In comparison, the Freedom class of Littoral Combat Ships , although faster, don’t pack anywhere near this must punch and they have over double the displacement. They likely cost far more per hull too—basically half a billion dollars each. Freedom class Littoral Combat Ship., USN There is no denying that Russia has a knack for stuffing a lot of combat capability into small vessels, especially as of late. The country’s Buyan class corvettes are especially vicious little ships, having showed off their ability to launch long-range cruise missiles at Syria from the Caspian Sea for the first time in 2015 . But the modularity and air defense capabilities of the Project 22160 boats is particularly attractive, as is their ability to operate in open ocean for long periods of time. What you end up with is almost a pocket frigate of sorts , one that can be fiscally obtainable to cash strapped navies both in terms of acquisition and sustainment costs. Russia is well aware of this as they look at any chance they can to sell their combat vessels to weapons customers abroad. Vietnam and Algeria especially come to mind. It will be interesting to see where this fairly exciting combat ship program goes in the coming years. The first ship in the class, the Vasily Bykov, is undergoing sea trials now and is expected to be delivered to the Russian Navy later this year. All six ships are currently under construction at the Zelenodolsk and Zalid shipyards and are intended to join Russia’s ever more potent Black Sea Fleet by the early 2020s.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Army has hired Lockheed Martin to continue development of a universal control system that will be able to run current and future active protection systems to defend a variety of vehicles. The goal of the Modular Active Protection Systems program, or MAPS, is to craft a common system that can rapidly accept upgrades in response to emerging threats, and could open up the possibility for a networked arrangement that links systems on multiple platforms. On March 27, 2018, Lockeed Martin announced it had received a new contract from the Army to further mature the basic MAPS controller. The system, which the service first began working on in 2014, forms the core of its long-term plans to add active protection systems to its armored vehicles. In the interim, it has already begun to integrate existing commercially available designs onto a portion of its M1 Abrams tanks , with the possibility that it could add similar equipment to select Bradley , Stryker , and other vehicles . The MAPS “enables automatic protection against threats like rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles,” according to a video presentation from Lockheed Martin. “Because it’s a modular system, proven elements stay right where they are, while you update or add components to defeat the new threat.” Active protection systems work in a wide variety of ways, but the end goal is always the same, to destroy or otherwise neutralize incoming rockets or missiles with some form of countermeasure. Radars, electro-optical or infared cameras, microphones, or other sensors detect the threat and then the system attempts to prevent it from hitting its mark. There “soft-kill” designs that either setting it off early or preventing it from going off at all and “hard-kill” types that use explosives or kinetic projectile to physically shoot it down. Soft kill systems can attack in a variety of ways. An electronic warfare suite might jam or even destroy guidance system or fuze inside a rocket or missile. Lasers or other directed energy beams can blind or disorient an enemy vehicle’s targeting system or optical and infrared seekers on the weapon itself. Arrays of launchers can automatically fire grenades with smoke to conceal the vehicle from the enemy or release chaff to confuse radar guidance systems. Hard kill setups, on the other hand, generally fall into one of two categories. These are either explosive panels that destroy the rocket or missile with a focused blast before it hits the vehicle or countermeasure launchers arrayed around the sides and top of a vehicle that fire a shotgun-like burst of pellets or other shrapnel to destroy the threat. Unfortunately, as active protection systems have become more common, many newer infantry anti-tank weapons have similarly gained their own countermeasures to break through those defensive systems. A key benefit then to the MAPS concept is that instead of having to rip out an defense suite and install a new one every time the sensors or countermeasures become obsolete, the Army will be able to readily swap out specific components as necessary. An infographic depicting the basic components of the Modular Active Protection Systems program., Lockheed Martin In addition to staying “ahead of the threat curve” by allowing the Army to rapidly update particular components as necessary, the arrangement might reduce overall cost and the time it takes to upgrade vehicles with the improved defenses. On top of that, it uses a software architecture that the Army, not Lockheed Martin, owns, which means the service can hand out the source code to any potential vendor interested in trying to develop a better active protection suite. If the equipment proves itself, it can then slot right into the control system. The only necessarily modifications will be actually fitting the the sensors and countermeasures to the vehicle. The Army’s first live MAPS test, in April 2017 , involved a so-called “soft kill” active protection system. The service did not specify what type of system it employed, but it may have been German defense contractor Rheinmetall’s Rapid Obscuring System (ROSY), which involves banks of compact grenade dischargers linked to laser and acoustic sensors to fire automatically upon detecting an incoming threat. In addition to smoke, it can also fire tear gas in riot control situations. Earlier in March 2018, the Army tested ROSY on M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys as part of the annual Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiments to evaluate potential new equipment. Rheinmetall has also proposed an even more flexible version that would allow customers to install individual launch tubes and clustered arrays in positions tailored to specific vehicles. The universal controller will also be able to manage hard-kill active protection systems, such as the Israeli designed Trophy active protection system, which the Army is already putting on a portion of its Abrams tanks, is one such system that could end up part of the larger MAPS framework. The service is also interested in using vehicle-mounted directed energy weapons to actively knock down threats, including small drones , in the future. MAPS’ inherent modularity and flexibility could offer impressive active protection capabilities. It might give particular units the option of only adding systems to respond to the particular enemy weapons they’re facing, rather than burdening their vehicles in an attempt to protect against any conceivable potential threat. Unfortunately, it doesn’t necessarily get around the basic deficiencies of many active protection systems, such only being able to defeat a limited number of threats before becoming dead weight or potentially posing a danger to nearby friendly troops or innocent bystanders. So far, active protection systems are most useful against infantry anti-tank weapons, such as rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles, rather than tank or artillery shells, too. An ammo-less directed energy weapon with unlimited magazine depth could be an optimal solution to many of these limitations, but there are potential limitations in these cases, too. Laser or microwave energy beams typically need significant power to remain capable at long ranges and can become unreliable when trying to penetrate through dust, smoke, and other obscurants. Those systems would also need to be powerful enough to defeat the threat in a relatively short engagement window. A viable system of this kind is still likely years away from becoming a reality. The U.S. military has explored the potential of jammers to form a protective “bubble” around vehicles, primarily to defeat improvised explosive devices, and the Russians have reportedly fielded similar systems that can either pre-detonate or disarm incoming rockets, missiles, and shells. The biggest problem here is ensuring that these electronic warfare suites don’t disrupt friendly communications or other electronics, but are still reliable enough to serve their purpose and do so out to an effective range. A US Army Stryker fitted with an experimental solid-state laser weapon. Primarily intended for countering small unmanned aerial vehicles, a more mature system could serve as the basis for a directed energy active protection system., US Army Still, MAPS might open up the possibility for novel ways to mitigate at least some of these issues, especially if the Army pushes ahead with plans to increase network connectivity between vehicles. On top of that, the service has made manned-unmanned teaming a central theme in the still developing requirements for its future Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) family, which it hopes will eventually replace some, if not all of its existing armored vehicles. Linking individual MAPS together could help improve sensor ranges, giving more warning of hostile threats. It could also allow one vehicle to try and shoot down a projectile aimed at another in a larger formation and simply add more active protection capacity to groups of vehicles large and small. Combined with unmanned vehicles, these capabilities could grow even more since sensors and active protection systems could be more widely distributed across the battlefield at lower costs. An unmanned Humvee “wingman,” in green-brown-black camouflage, sites next to a manned teammate, painted in sand scheme, during a test earlier in 2018., US Army A single unmanned ground vehicle could serve as a dedicated sensor node or as a truck loaded with active countermeasures. This could help keep costs down, too, since each drone might not necessarily require the full suite of systems. This will be an important consideration if the Army intends to field large numbers of these vehicles to go along with manned vehicles. These more traditional platforms could easily be expensive in their own right if they end up packed with robust active protection suites, as well as advanced weapons, fire control systems, communications, and more. It’s not hard to imagine a future where wheeled or tracked drones act as pickets to lead the way for formations of manned armor into hostile territory. This could be especially valuable in tightly packed or otherwise constrained environments, such as dense urban areas , where unmanned vehicles could scout ahead to spot of neutralize threats, reducing risks to manned vehicles and dismounted troops. An unmanned M113 armored personnel carrier leads a pair of M1 Abrams tanks in a test in 2017., US Army The MAPS plan could also serve as a good model for how to develop complete future vehicles that can be more rapidly improved upon as time goes on and as new technology become available. It might also help the Army meet its aggressive development schedule for its Next Generation Combat Vehicle family, or NGCV, which will include both manned and unmanned types. The service hopes these will replace existing Abrams Tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Stryker wheeled armored vehicles, and more by 2028. It expects to pick a vendor or vendors to build the first demonstrator vehicles later in 2018 and have those designs ready for testing the year after. Active protection is already a major consideration in the NGCV project, which will likely include the MAPS architecture, so we may get a closer look at how the Army plans integrate this new modular system in the near future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Mar 8, 2017",The US Navy Still Hasn’t Formally Decided to Add Hellfires to Its Littoral Combat Ships,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than a year after the Freedom -class Littoral Combat Ship USS Detroit first test fired an AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire, the U.S. Navy still hasn’t officially decided whether or not to proceed with production of the complete Surface-to-Surface Missile Module, or SSMM, for the rest of the ships. But without the missiles, the ships will have even more limited utility in actual combat situations , criticisms that have already prompted the service to start an all-new frigate project . In February 2018, the Navy gave members of Congress these details in an update on the SSMM’s progress, Seapower magazine reported . The service has been working to integrate Hellfire into the module, which is part of the larger Surface Warfare Mission Package for both Freedom – and Independence -class LCS, since 2014 . The full package also includes a pair of 30mm Bushmaster II cannons and the ability to launch an MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter, two MQ-8 Fire Scout drones, and a pair of small Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats , or RHIBs. The Hellfire component “is currently in testing and exceeding requirements,” the report said, according to Seapower . “To date, the SSMM has achieved an 83 percent successful engagement rate.” As of the date of the report to lawmakers, there had been 24 test launchers as part of developmental testing. The Navy said that four of those failed due to unspecified software problems, but it is not clear whether that refers to the SSMM’s fire control systems or the software internal to the AGM-114L. Regardless, the Navy said it had successfully fixed those issues. At present, the USS Milwaukee , another Freedom -class LCS, is carrying the prototype vertical launch system and fire control components. Since that Navy is planning to send that ship out on an operational deployment later in 2018, the service plans to reinstall the weapons on USS Detroit in July 2018 to continue the developmental work. If this process and the subsequent tests go as planned, the Navy hopes to finish the SSMM’s development by the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1, 2018. With any luck, operational test and evaluation will be done by the end of 2018, at which time the service will make a final, formal decision about how to proceed. The existing goal is for the system will begin entering service on a deployed LCS in early 2019. “The addition of the SSMM will make LCS with an embarked [surface warfare mission package] the most capable ship in the Navy in countering the small-boat threat,” the report said. The AGM-114L Hellfire should be more than capable of handling those types of threats and would significantly improve the two LCS classes’ abilities to defend themselves in constrained, littoral areas where they are supposed to operate. It also might make the ships capable of acting as a picket against those threats for larger naval surface task forces or carrier strike groups. With a millimeter wave radar seeker, each missile has an all-weather fire-and-forget capability. The fire control system can either cue the missiles with a radar on the ship or the missiles can lock on after launch having used own internal inertial guidance system to bring close to the target. This combination of capabilities would give the crew on the LCS the option of targeting multiple small boats in a swarm and firing a barrage of missiles to attack them all. With this in mind, it seems hard to imagine the Navy wouldn’t decide to pursue the SSMM when testing wraps up and there do not appear to be any serious developmental issues to hold up that process. More importantly, without the weapons, the service would be unlikely to get as much value out of the ships at all. It’s worth noting that the Hellfires are a replacement for a far more capable concept based on the U.S. Army’s XM501 Non-Line Of Sight (NLOS) system. The AGM-114L vertical launch array fits into the empty space on both classes of LCS that was supposed to have held these weapons. The XM501 launchers were supposed to be able to fire different flavors of missile, a standard strike version with a range of 30 miles and a quasi-drone loitering model that could stay aloft for up to 30 minutes before dropping on a target. The AGM-114L has a range of around five miles, but this could be less for shipboard systems due to being vertically launched and having no altitude advantage. When the Army cancelled that program in 2011, fallout from the decision to cancel the larger and ambitious Future Combat Systems project two years earlier, the Navy initially decided not to pursue a replacement of any kind. Three years later it bowed to pressure and chose a vertical launch system capable of firing the well established Hellfire, but which offered significantly limited capabilities. That’s not to say the threat of swarming fast attack craft or even small manned or unmanned suicide boats isn’t real. Far from it and without the SSMM both classes of LCS have been conspicuously absent from operations in parts of the world where this threat is most pronounced, particularly the Strait of Hormuz leading in and out of the Persian Gulf and the Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. The video below shows a test of the Longbow Hellfire vertical launch system from a test ship rather than an LCS in 2015 with simulated small enemy boats as the targets. But even with the new missiles, part of patchwork of add-on capabilities the Navy has tried to stitch together on the perpetually underperforming ships over the years, the LCS will remain of limited utility in even mid-level threat environments and largely incapable of operating independently in an actual combat scenario. As it stands now, the ships’ only other on board weapons are a 57mm rapid fire gun and a RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile close-in protection system. There are also plans to add an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile capability in the future and the Independence -class USS Coronado has demonstrated the ability to launch RGM-84 Harpoons . The Navy might conceivably decide the resources it is spending on the Hellfire capability could be better utilized on other pressing projects . The service might also come to the conclusion it makes more sense to focus entirely on the new frigate program , which will almost certainly produce more capable ships. This seems unlikely, though, since abandoning the SSMM would be yet another admission that the LCS as a concept has failed to live up to the hype. It would also effectively relegate the existing examples entirely to second-line duties, such as counter drug patrols, something the service seems disinclined to do with any such ship for any reason. The USS Independence , in the foreground, sails with the USS Freedom . These are the Navy’s two distinct Littoral Combat Ship classes., USN With more than two dozen of the ships in service or on order, and shipyards worried about maintaining their production capacity even at the present rate, it’s hard to imagine that Navy would choose this route or be able to convince Congress to approve the plans. In the meantime, the service seems determined to try and squeeze as much capability out of the Freedom – and Independence -classes as it can, at least until the new frigates arrive. That being said, it seems increasingly apparent, unfortunately, that the LCS are unlikely to ever reach the level of capability the Navy desires, as is evidenced by the requirements it has set out in the frigate program. So, while it seems very likely that the Navy will follow through with adding Hellfires to the ships, the emphasis on future upgrades to the ships’ firepower or other systems may steadily decrease. At a certain point, no amount of bolted on components will be able to truly make up the inherent limitations of both classes.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 23, 2017",This Is What It Looks Like When You Get Intercepted By An F-15C Eagle,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 142nd Fighter Wing is one of the world’s premier air F-15 Eagle units. Based in Portland, Oregon, their mission includes sitting alert all day, every day, waiting to scramble at a moment’s notice to intercept everything from airliners having emergencies, to enemy cruise missiles attacking from the sea, to even more ‘exotic’ aerial targets . So they have to be trained in the unique procedures and techniques used to find and engage with a wide variety of aircraft with vastly different performance capabilities. The F-15C typically weight over 50,000lbs at takeoff and packs a pair of Pratt and Whitney F100 turbofans that crank out 47,500lb of thrust in afterburner. Compare this to a Cessna 172 that weighs a couple thousand pounds loaded and runs on a 160hp piston engine and you get the picture of how vast the disparity in performance can be between the Eagle and its target. This makes flying tricky for Eagle drivers attempting to execute safe and effective intercepts. With this in mind, the Air National Guard constantly trains to execute intercepts on various targets, and because wayward light aircraft pilots straying where they shouldn’t is a constant source of scrambles, this training includes intercepting Cessnas from the Civil Air Patrol. One of these intercepts can be seen in dramatic fashion in the video below. The video comes to us from Civil Air Patrol pilot Michael Clarey who had the pleasure of helping provide prey for the Eagles last June. We asked Michael about his experience, here’s what he said: “On June 25th, 2017 I was asked if I would like to participate in a Felix Keynote mission on June 29th. The mission was for a flight crew to fly a Cessna into “restricted airspace” and have the Portland Air National Guard F-15s scramble to come intercept us. Obviously I said yes to the mission! We get down near Bend, Oregon, out in the middle of nowhere and we were told by 9AM the F-15s would be on us. 9:05 comes up and off our four and eight o’clock we see two F-15’s slowly approaching us. They confirmed we’re the aircraft in question and were entering into restricted airspace. Over the comms we hear, repeated three times, “Red, White and Blue Cessna, N101SP you are entering restricted airspace. Please turn left to a heading of 230.” We were instructed to ignore any communication between us. After their third attempt of contacting us you can see they get really close of our left wing. Still, we can’t acknowledge them. After a few passes they disappear. Minutes go by as we’re trying to find them, then BAM they perform a hammer head right in front of our Cessna to intimidate/grab our attention to turn around. All in all, it was an awesome experience that I would do again in a heart beat.” In the video we can see the 142nd Fighter Wing’s fully armed color bird do a slow high-alpha flyby of Michael’s Cessna, before punching the afterburners to maneuver around again. Michael noted to The War Zone that is was really odd hearing the Eagle’s thunderous engine noise inside the Cessna’s cockpit.

FAA The pod’s telescopic, stabilized optics can be slaved to the F-15’s radar, allowing it to easily get an ID on an aircraft from well beyond visual range. Other upgrades are also in the works, which you can read all about here and here . Eagles taxi in unison out of their base at Portland International Airport during a snap readiness drill. , 142nd Fight Wing Recently the 142nd Fighter Wing, which guards airspace ranging from British Columbia all the way down to Northern California, had a snap readiness drill where they sortied 13 of their 21 aircraft at once in less than 24 hours. It was an impressive display, especially considering their jets are over 30 years old. Still, they are some of the newest F-15C/Ds made. Considering how much the USAF has shrunk in terms of number of fighter squadrons since 2003, and especially since 1991, Air Guard Eagles have to be ready to deploy on short notice during a crisis abroad. So no, the Air National Guard is not a bunch of weekend warriors who fly obsolete gear and would only be deployed if the world was coming to an end. Quite the opposite. Today they are a key element of the Pentagon’s front line air combat force. A special thanks to our friend and aviation photographer Paul Schweizerhof for pointing us towards Michael’s video.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",US Marines Might Soon Get New Versions of The Vietnam-Era M72 Rocket Launcher,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The U.S. Marine Corps is hard at work reexamining what mix of shoulder-fired rockets and recoilless rifles gives its infantry units best means of destroying variety of different targets. Those same elements may soon begin receiving new versions of the Vietnam-era M72 rocket launcher to further increase their firepower and allow them to use the weapons safely from inside buildings. Marines from 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment got a chance to test out the new versions of the M72 at the Urban Advanced Naval Technology Exercises 2018, or ANTX18, at Camp Pendleton in California earlier in March 2018, according to Defense News . The event was an opportunity to showcase a host of new technologies, including unmanned ground vehicles to support infantry units, small drones to help scout ahead and spot potential threats, hand-held jamming devices to protect against small enemy unmanned aerial vehicles, new lightweight battle buggies , improved networked communications devices, and more. So it’s notable that updated variants of the M72, a weapon that first entered service in 1963, were also on display during the drills. “It’s a game changer,” Lance Corpoal Sam Elichalt, a squad leader within 3/4th Marine’s Kilo Company, told Defense News in regards to the newest types. At its core, the weapon is a lightweight, shoulder-fired 66mm rocket that comes pre-packaged inside its own launcher. Depending on the type of rocket inside, the complete system weighs between eight and 12 pounds, three pounds lighter at its heaviest than a shoulder-fired M3E1 Carl Gustav recoilless rifle is unloaded. The launcher itself does have attachment points for aiming lasers or other sighting systems, but it’s supposed to be disposable and it has built-in rudimentary leaf sights. A Marine prepares to fire an M72 during a training exercise., USMC Firing it is simple enough that the manufacturer, at present Norway’s Nammo and its American subsidiary Talley Nammo, prints the operating instructions on the side of the tube. An individual pulls out a grenade-style safety pin, fully extends the launch tube, which raises the sights and makes the weapon ready to fire. Beyond its light weight, which allows troops to easily carry multiple launchers at once, and simplicity, one of the system’s growing strengths is the number of different rockets available. When the U.S. Army and Marine Corps first adopted the weapon, they both intended to employ it primarily as a lightweight anti-tank weapon. Related video—The Carl Gustav recoilless rifle: Testing increasingly showed the small 66mm rocket had limited effectiveness against tanks, though it could blast through lighter armored vehicles. In Vietnam, where encounters with enemy armor were limited in general, soldiers and Marines used the weapons to blow apart bunkers and otherwise provide additional fire support. In the latter stages of the conflict, the weapon did also prove its worth against lighter tanks, notably during the Battle of Lang Vei in 1969. During the Battle of An Loc in 1972, South Vietnamese troops exploited the city’s confines to attack heavier North Vietnamese armor with M72s from the side and rear flanks where they were more vulnerable. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iUsYbuTukWs In the late 1980s, the Army began replacing the bulk of its M72s with a new, Swedish-designed 84mm disposable recoilless rifle, known as the AT-4 or M136. But the portability and flexibility of the smaller weapon has kept it in service ever since, especially with special operations forces that appreciated its ability to take on other roles. Nammo now produces more than a half dozen different variants, many of which are already in U.S. military service. These still include anti-armor types good for destroying light vehicles and unarmored trucks. Some of those models include a more sensitive “graze” fuze that detonates the rocket even if it only glances off a target, increasing the likelihood that it will do at least some damage. A modern M72 launcher, in gray, and different types of rockets Nammo offers for the system., Joseph Trevithick There is also a version with a larger, penetrating warhead that can break through brick walls and reinforced doors before exploding within. This “anti-structure” type increases the weapon’s ability to blow up fortifications and other hard cover. Another variant has similar abilities to bust through barriers, but combines it with a large fragmentation warhead that creates a cloud of shrapnel that is particularly deadly in a confined space. Nammo also continues to improve the handling of the launcher and is now offering programmable rounds where the operating can select certain options before firing. One of these newer dual-fuze options gives the shooter the ability to have the rocket explode when it hits a target or delay its detonation to try and bust through a barrier. Nammo’s M72E11 Mk 2 programmable rocket., Joseph Trevithick But perhaps most importantly, the Norwegian defense contractor has devised a system that eliminates the backblast of firing the rocket, which makes it safer to use near other friendly forces and from within a building. It’s still dangerous to stand directly behind someone shooting an M72 up to 230 feet away. With M72s using the new “fire from enclosure” propelling system, Marines would not have to necessarily expose themselves from cover to fire the weapon. The system works by inserting a liquid ballast at the rear of the tube, which absorbs the blast and overpressure as the rocket speeds away, and replacing the rocket with a propellant charge similar to those on mortar shells. The arrangement has the added benefit of reducing the weapon’s acoustic signature, reportedly similar to a pistol shot, which could help conceal the firer and just protect their hearing. A graphic showing the backblast area for common M72 variants., US Army This does come at the cost of an extra pound of weight, but the complete weapon will still be lighter than larger shoulder-fired systems. However, no matter how many firing mode options Nammo can give the M72, it will still be a single-shot, disposable system. This inherently limits its use and is one of the reasons why both the Marine Corps and the Army are increasingly looking at fielding the reloadable Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. Though heavier and bulkier, that system gives troops the ability to fire multiple rounds from the same weapon and load up only the one they need for a particular target, instead of having to find the appropriate M72 in a pile of outwardly identical looking launchers. Marines fire an M3E1 Carl Gustav during a training exercise., USMC The M72 will have the benefit of being safe to use from inside buildings, but the Marines already have special “confined space” versions of the AT-4, known as the M136A1 in service, too, but the backblast from those still requires significant room for safe firing. Those Swedish weapons are also available pre-loaded with anti-structure, bunker-busting, and other types of warheads. That’s not to say the smaller M72 might not fill a useful role and offer an even more lightweight anti-armor and anti-structure weapon. The system’s inherent benefits prompted the Marine Corps to extend the life of its existing weapons a decade ago. US Army soldiers fire a “confined space” M136A1, giving a sense of how intense the backblast still is with this variant., US Army Still, the Marines will have to weigh the costs, both in terms of buying the weapons and adding them to the logistics chain. They are already presented with a similar decision about whether it makes sense to keep their Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapons, which just received a major overhaul, and begin fielding the Carl Gustav. Depending on how the Corps ultimately decides to proceed, its quite possible that Marines could still be using some version of the M72, if even in a limited capacity, for the foreseeable future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia may be briefly wearing the world’s most advanced Eagle crown with their new F-15SAs , but Qatar will assume that honor when the first of its 36—or possibly 72 if they execute an option for more— F-15QAs are delivered in the next couple of years. Along with a totally remodeled cockpit featuring large panel touch screen displays, Qatar’s F-15s will also do away with the Strike Eagle’s iconic green-glowing, wide-angle heads up display (HUD), replacing it with an innovative new design from BAE Systems. Boeing’s advanced Eagle cockpit is very slick. The latest Strike Eagle derivative WSOs finally have a much needed big display for targeting. The F-15C/D Golden Eagle fleet needs this to make the most out of its upgraded capabilities if it is to soldier on for decades. pic.twitter.com/ZdrvaEnyHV — Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 5, 2018 When the Strike Eagle arrived on the scene in the late 1980s, its massive HUD was a technological marvel. It covered a lot more visual real estate than the F-15A/B/C/D’s unit, which itself was cutting-edge when it was integrated onto the jet in the early 1970s. The F-15E’s Kaiser IR-2394/A wide angle HUD was even more special because it could project the forward-looking infrared video from the Strike Eagle’s LANTIRN navigation pod up in front of the pilot over a large area. This ability is referred to as ‘raster’ and the ability to project symbology being dubbed ‘line.’ The Strike Eagle’s HUD could project complex line and raster imagery simultaneously. F-15Es cockpit setup with wide-angle raster HUD. , USAF The E model’s setup also used a single combiner glass and had a relatively svelte frame, giving it an outwardly modern-looking appearance. The same setup was also used on Northrop’s failed YF-23 Advanced Tactical Fighter demonstrator. A maintainer wipes down the F-15E’s cockpit during Operation Desert Shield. The F-15E made its combat debut in Desert Storm, which you can read all about here. , USAF Combined with the pod’s terrain following radar, the Strike Eagle’s pilot had a whole new level of situational awareness when flying in the dark of night just a couple hundred feet above the ground at high speed. Eventually the Block 40 F-16C/D would also feature a HUD optimized for the same LANTIRN system. That unit was known as the wide-angle raster or WAR HUD. Raster HUD showing projection of FLIR video fom LANTIRN navigation pod. , USAF The introduction of night vision goggles and a reduced emphasis on nap-of-the-earth combat flying lessened the demand for these tailored HUD systems, and more modern HUDs became line and raster capable as well, they also allow for a wide field of view without being so cumbersome. Youtube GIF Additionally, the 1980s era tech raster HUDs feature fairly massive components, are comparatively maintenance intensive, and they weigh a lot. Because of these issues, it’s harder to modify and upgrade a fighter’s cockpit around them. Product Image/USAF The belated introduction of helmet mounted displays on American fighters has also decreased the reliance solely on the HUD for ‘eyes out of the cockpit’ flying and as a source of primary targeting information. The F-35’s helmet is the most capable , but many other options exist that provide great capabilities without the extensive integration demands, and now these can include the ability to use the system with night vision goggles as well as a daytime visor. JHMCS II, Rockwell Collins For instance, the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) that is used on the majority of American fighter aircraft now features a “digital eye piece” that allows for day and night functionality. And these helmet mounted displays can be integrated in such a way that they do not interfere with the functionality of a HUD by blinking off whenever the pilot’s gaze is pointed directly at the Heads Up Display. So with all this in mind, and considering the Eagle is finally getting a new cockpit, it’s not surprising that Boeing thinks the F-15 is due for a less ungainly HUD system that can still do everything the old system can and more. Think of it as moving from an old analogue tube TV to a digital flatscreen TV. And this is precisely where BAE’s modular LiteHUD system comes in to the picture—literally. For the Eagle, Boeing told The War Zone that this system is called the Low Profile HUD, but really it’s just a derivative of LiteHUD which offers fairly extreme enhancements over legacy HUD designs. It weighs 50 percent less and takes up 60 percent less space than most existing types. It can project high resolution imagery (1280H x 1024W), has a wide 25X20 degree field of view (the existing model offers a 21X28 degree field of view), and is completely digital. This all means that it will save money over the life of the jet and will help when it comes to mission readiness. It’s also not obtrusive in the cockpit. BAE Systems In just the couple of years LiteHUD has been in existence, the system has gone through a series of refinements and it has already been incorporated on advanced Hawk trainers, AC-130 gunships, and Textron’s Scorpion, among other aircraft. BAE Systems So going forward, LiteHUD will now be included on future Strike Eagle derivatives. This marks the product’s first known fighter platform customer, and it’s a heavy-weight, high-tech beast with a reputation for dogfighting prowess at that. Saudi Arabia’s newest Eagles have an advanced cockpit with upgraded displays and up-front control panel, but it can’t match to the capability that widescreen cockpit displays can provide: The system’s modular and compact nature makes it ideal for everything from training aircraft to high-end experimental aircraft as well, so don’t be surprised if you see these things popping up more and more, especially now that it has the coveted Eagle’s endorsement. There’s even a good chance that it will replace the F-15C/D Eagle’s legacy HUD if and when the USAF provides funds to upgrade those jets’ cockpits to a similar configuration. Supposedly this initiative is already part of a series of measures that aim to keep the F-15C/D relevant for roughly another 20 years . A structural upgrade, completion of AESA radar conversion program , an infrared search and track system, new mission computers, a podded communications gateway , conformal fuel tanks and other smaller upgrades are also part of this overall plan. Boeing via @ abdulmoiz1990 It has been reported that the Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS), a new digital electronic warfare and radar warning receiver suite that will give the F-15C/D a huge survivability boost, has been cancelled. This is not accurate. The USAF is focusing on installing it on the F-15E fleet and is prioritizing an F-15C/D a structural upgrade at this time. It will likely be added later if the USAF plans on sticking to its air superiority Eagle roadmap and keeping the jet for the foreseeable future. As for the F-15QA, it will have all the features the F-15SA has, including the activation of wing weapons stations one and nine, fly-by-wire flight control system, digital electronic warfare suite and other enhancements, but it will add a new internal wing structure and the new cockpit design. The cockpit upgrade is a critical feature because it can allow the F-15’s crew to visualize the battle-space and what the jets sensors and those connected to it via data-link are seeing in a whole new way. In essence, it gives the F-15 a far greater boost in capability than one would assume just by hearing the phase ‘new cockpit.’ The situational awareness boost is a game changer. The F-15C’s cockpit, aside from some small tweaks and a the addition of a single multi-function display, remains largely the same as it did in 1982 when this photo was taken. The HUD, although its optics have been enhanced, has the same profile as it always did. The small size of the F-15C/D’s HUD has led to some interesting jokes between its pilots and those of the Strike Eagle. , USAF With the extra weapons stations and new weapons racks, the F-15QA will be able to act as a missile truck, packing up to 22 AMRAAMs on a single mission. Combined with the new cockpit and upgraded sensors, Eagle crews can work as much as ‘battle managers’ as classic fighter pilots, drawing on diverse combat assets to overwhelm the enemy. https://youtube.com/watch?v=xGY2JBuSCU0 It’s amazing to think that as the F-15 approaches its 50th birthday the jet continues to receive new capabilities right off the production line in St. Louis. But the new cockpit—upgraded HUD included—in particular has been a long awaited evolution that will really squeeze the most out of the jet and its new sensors. Once the feature is flying operationally, it will likely give the USAF a kick in the behind to make new cockpits a reality on their F-15C/D ‘Golden Eagles’ as well.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 14, 2017",Why Would The South Korean Navy Be Eyeing A Nuclear Submarine Capability?,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. South Korea’s Navy is looking into the practical and political feasibility of domestic design and production of a nuclear-powered submarine. The study comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea and concerns about that country’s own submarine-launched ballistic missile developments, but could further strain relationships on the Peninsula and beyond and could prove to be technically complex and expensive without a clear imperative to develop such a boat in the first place. According to Defense News , in October 2017, the South Korean Navy hired Seoul-based think tank the Korea Defense Network (KDN) to conduct a five-month long study of possible designs. The final report recommended developing a nuclear attack submarine akin the France’s Barracuda -class . “We’re reviewing the KDN report on indigenous submarine building in a careful manner,” a spokesperson for the South Korean Navy told Defense News. “The nuclear-powered submarine-building plan is highly sensitive for itself and especially at a time when the discussions of inter-Korean summit and U.S.-North Korea summit talks are being taken place.” At present, the South Korean Navy has nine Jang Bogo -class submarines, a derivative of the German Type 209, and seven of a planned class of nine Sohn Won-yil or Jang Bogo II boats, the country’s name for Germany’s Type 214 . Both classes are diesel-electric, but the latter class has advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems that make them quieter and allow them to run underwater for greater periods of time. This new class of submarine could supplant the South Korean Navy’s existing requirement for a third class of nine boats. The South Korean Navy’s submarine Jang Bogo ., USN A nuclear-powered submarine could offer an even lower acoustic signature although some AIP equipped boats are now extremely quiet. It would certainly be able to remain below the surface for even longer than the Type 214s, further reducing the potential for detection and extending the submarine’s practical patrol range. The French Barracuda -class, which KDN cited in its report as a good conceptual starting place, has a submerged displacement of approximately 5,300 tons with a full combat load. This is more than twice that of the Sohn Won-yil -class boats and nearly 2,000 greater displacement than those in the still in development Jang Bogo III-class . The additional space could potentially accommodate additional weapons, including the ability to launch anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles from its torpedo tubes or a small vertical launch system array, as found on the U.S. Navy’s Los Angeles -class . It might also allow for a more powerful sensor suite, giving the South Korean Navy an important tool for secretly gathering intelligence on coastal targets and possibly those further inland, not just with regards to North Korea, but other potential regional opponents, such as China. The video below shows a South Korean Navy test of a domestically designed submarine-launched land-attack cruise missile in 2013. There had also been unconfirmed reports that the Jang Bogo III might have the ability to launch a ballistic missile, possibly based on the Hyunmoo-series . A nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, able to operate largely undetected within range of North Korea for months at a time, could give South Korea another important second-strike capability to help deter an attack. A nuclear powered submarine would also be a boon for countering North Korea’s apparent drive to develop its own submarine-launched ballistic missile capability . The ability to conduct extended patrols would be essential for monitoring any such activity and shadowing the enemy boats during a potential crisis. The North Koreans also have dozens of smaller coastal and midget submarines that could pose a threat during a conflict and are one of multiple ways special operations forces would infiltrate into South Korea. Beyond North Korea, South Korea also has to contend with an growing and increasingly advanced Chinese military and an increasingly assertive Russia, both of whom are stepping up their activities in East Asia and beyond . China is in also in the process of expanding its arsenal of both nuclear and advanced diesel electric submarines and is increasingly inclined to export the latter to its regional allies, as well as expanding its underwater monitoring capabilities . Russians are eager to try and revitalize their subsurface fleets , as well. With all this in mind, it’s not surprising that South Korea is seriously looking at a new, indigenous class of nuclear submarine. Many of those same considerations were likely the driving force behind a secret study of the concept in 2003. North Korean premier Kim Jong-un on board one of the country’s Soviet-era Romeo -class submarines., KCNA “During the 2003 project, we finished works of basic design for indigenous nuclear-powered submarine, as well as of a miniaturized nuclear reactor,” Moo Keun-sik, a retired Navy captain who had led the so-called ‘326 initiative,’ told Defense News. “South Korea has enough ability to design and develop its own nuclear submarine.” KDN’s suggestion of building an analogue to the French Barracuda , a relatively modern design, suggests that its analysts share that view. But regardless of whether the country has the requisite knowledge and industrial capacity, or the ability to rapidly develop either of those sectors, it might not necessarily have the time or funds to commit to such an ambitious project. Modern submarines are complex and expensive to build and nuclear boats are even more so in both respects. It could take at least 10 years for the first-in-class submarine to nearly two decades for the full class to become operational. The South Korean government reportedly expects that each one could cost more $1 billion, but this seems particularly optimistic. The French Barracudas cost approxiamtely $1.6 billion and there could easily be cost growth in the South Korean project due to domestic shipbuilders’ inexperience with the new design and nuclear submarines in general. South Korea’s entire defense budget for the 2017 fiscal cycle was approximately $34 billion , which amounted to 10 percent of the country’s total annual budget expenditure and was a four percent increase in defense spending over the previous year. At $1 billion a piece, each one of these submarines would amount to nearly three percent of this annual expenditure. And that total budget is likely to grow again, even if only to account for inflation, new submarines would still be competing for resources with the raising costs associated with plans to purchase and operate stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters , RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, early warning satellites , larger surface warships , various new cruise and ballistic missiles , and more. On March 28, 2018, Lockheed Martin rolled out the first of South Korea’s planned 40 conventional F-35As, but the country could be looking to buy more short and vertical takeoff and landing F-35B models for its Dokdo -class amphibious assault ships. South Korea’s first F-35A Joint Strike Fighter at the Lockheed Martin rollout event., Lockheed Martin The most complex hurdles may be political, though. South Korea is a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , or NPT, and has a bilateral agreement with the United States not to enrich fissile nuclear material above a certain level. Many nuclear reactors on submarines require highly enriched fuel – understood to often be near the grade necessary to build a nuclear weapon – in order to provide sufficient power in the necessarily compact package. Building a nuclear submarine with such a powerplant would violate the bilateral deal. The need to build enrichment or other nuclear facilities, or otherwise acquire the highly enriched fissile material, could also draw international criticism that South Korea is abiding by the letter, but not the spirit of the NPT, effectively developing a nuclear weapons program in all but name. These issues are at the core of why South Korea conducted the 326 Initiative in secret and why it abandoned it after it became public, attracting the attention of both the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is also one of the main reasons why the KDN think tank recommended the Barracuda -class model, since it uses a low enriched uranium-fueled reactor. This could help reduce criticism about the enrichment issue, as South Korea already operates civil nuclear powerplants using similar fuel. However, North Korea is likely to take any suggestion that the South Koreans are looking to “nuclearize” their military in any way as both a threat and justification for its own nuclear weapons program. It would also provide ammunition for the North Korean propaganda machine , which already accuses the United States and its “puppets” in Seoul of being the real nuclear aggressors . Kim Jong-un speaks during an unnaounced visit to Beijing, China in March 2018., KCNA These considerations are especially pronounced given that South Korea is looking to de-escalate tensions and directly engage with Kim Jong-un and his regime. The North Korean Premier is now set to attend a historic meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in South Korea in April 2018, which will be the first time a leader from North Korea has ever visited the South. There is also potential that this decision could upset the potential for talks between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. As such, the United States could still decide it is too risky politically for South Korea to pursue any form of nuclear-powered submarine and pressure them again to abandon the effort. That being said, the Trump administration has expressed a willingness to renegotiate other bilateral agreements limiting South Korean weapons development, notably those limiting the maximum range and capacity of the country’s ballistic missiles. It is possible that the United States under Trump could even be willing to consider relaxing the nuclear enrichment requirements in the face of North Korean threats or as a potential bargaining chip to offer in exchange for Pyongyang abandoning its own nuclear initiatives. South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, left, and North Korean delegation head Ri Son Gwon exchange documents after a meeting to set the terms for a meeting between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in., Korea Pool Photo via AP But its not entirely clear why the South Koreans would even need to go through all of this trouble in the first place. France has already developed a non-nuclear AIP version of Barracuda for export, which reportedly offers near-nuclear performance, with Australia being the launch customer . A similar boat could easily fulfill South Korea’s requirements and appeared to be what they were leaning toward in the first place with the Jang Bogo III project. Since South Korea is already under the United States extended nuclear deterrence umbrella, its curious that it would decide to pursue an expensive new conventional second-strike capability with a limited ability to deter North Korea. Its true that the South Korean government has made it clear that they are prepared to unleash a broad conventional retaliatory strike in response to any major North Korean aggression, but they already have a submarine-based component to those plans in the form of torpedo tube-launched land attack cruise missiles. Of course, there are no concrete indications that North Korea is interested in abandoning its nuclear weapons any time soon, though, as it sees them as essential to preserving the country’s totalitarian regime. Perhaps, the South Koreans see having the building blocks of their nuclear weapons program, coupled with a nuclear submarine as a capable and survivable launch platform, waiting in the wings as an important hedge against the possibility of the situation on the Peninsula deteriorating to a particularly worrisome degree. There have already been rumors that North Korea’s rapidly growing nuclear-capable ballistic missile arsenal may be prompting South Korean authorities to reconsider their stance on nuclear weapons, even though this would require them to join North Korea in backing out of the NPT. There is already the suggestion that South Korea has the ability to rapidly go nuclear if it decides to go that route. All told, a nuclear-powered submarine could significantly expand the capabilities of the South Korean Navy, but it remains less clear if the country is really interested in pursuing such a costly project, both in terms of actual funds and political capital.

Tyler Rogoway and Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 5, 2018",Mysterious B-21 Raider Combined Test Force Patch Emerges,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A B-21 Raider Combined Test Force patch has been put up for sale on Ebay . If the insignia is authentic it would be the first indication that such an outfit has been established to support the new stealth bomber’s development. It would also be yet another indication that the stealth bomber’s development is proceeding swiftly and it fits with recent comments made the of flight test operations at Edwards Air Force Base who noted that his staff “will be testing it here in the near future.” We first spotted the patch when our friend and talented aviation photographer Ashley Wallace posted it on Twitter. Its basic design consists of yellow ring with black borders and the phrases “B-21” and “Combined Test Force” around a central design. In the middle there is a cloaked figure, which appears to either be the Grim Reaper or another sort of wraith, with a star or “twinkle” in its eye, pointing what may be a skeletal finger that leads, through a trail of smoke, to a silhouette of the B-21. eBay/deannaandgordon In the background is a globe motif oriented to primarily show the western hemisphere. In red at the top of the globe is the Latin word “praenuntius,” which translates to either herald or harbinger, or signs of things to come. Near the bottom there is what may be a bird or dragon in black above the Roman numerals XVII, or 17. Grim Reapers or similar spectral figures are not uncommon motifs in morale patches, especially those associated with secret programs, those dealing with low-observable designs, or both. “Wraith” is even an informal nickname for the RQ-170 Sentinel. The star in the eye could be a callback of some sort to the B-2 Combined Test Force logo , which featured a similar heraldic item at the end of one of a pair of bird-of-prey-like talons. If it is indeed a black bird, that could also be related to the names and motifs applied to previous secret and stealth projects, as well. Similar imagery has been used in secretive stealth programs in the past, as well as for the B-2’s own CTF., Militarypatcheandpins.com/thelivingmoon.com It’s less clear what the Roman numerals “17” might represent. Some have already posited it could be a reference to the actual Combined Test Force squadron, which will be assigned to the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in the future – if it doesn’t exist already in some form. The Wing’s 417th Flight Test Squadron shut down operations in 2012 with the cancellation of the YAL-1A airborne laser program and could be the unit in question, but there is no indication the Air Force has reactivated it since then. The Air Force did, without any other apparent notice, reactivate the 452nd Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base in March 2017, which seems like a more plausible reference to “17.” It could also have some entirely different meaning altogether. There is an Italian superstition that the Roman numerals for 17 are unlucky since they can form an anagram that translates to “I lived,” with the implication that one’s life is over. The patch also caught the eye of our friend David Cenciotti of Theaviaitonist.com, and he says the seller obtained the patch from personnel at Edwards AFB who were standing-up the B-21 test program. This vibes with what The War Zone has long reported —the South Base installation at Edwards AFB has been in transition for some time and that the B-21, and possibly other cutting-edge platforms and munitions that will work with it, will use the facility as a headquarters for development. We also have to remember that Combined Test Forces work to bring all the elements of a program—including those of contractors and various military stakeholders—together to devise and execute test program that will usher the weapon system into an operational state and then sustain and upgrade it after that. This includes developing and evaluating the many different technologies that make up the aircraft as a whole. B-21 Raider, USAF With this in mind, a flying prototype isn’t needed for test work to begin, far from it in fact, albeit proof of concept, technology demonstrators, and aircraft that the B-21 borrows tech direct from do likely exist in the classified realm. Still, there are plenty of components to put through their paces before they fly on a finalized design. Systems integration is one of the biggest challenges during the genesis of any weapons platform, yet alone for one that is likely to end up being the most complex airplane the world has ever seen. We have even heard about some of the issues the bomber has already faced during development. In other words, the B-21 test team should really exist by now as they have a lot of work to do in a fairly short period of time. The USAF wants the aircraft operational by around 2025 . The patch has leaped up dramatically in price in recent hours, with a current bid of $103.50. Let us know what you think of its symbolism in the comments below.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Croatia Will Replace Its MiG-21s With Second-Hand F-16Ds From Israel,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Croatia has picked its supplier for fighters to replace its geriatric and largely unreliable MiG-21 fleet. Israel, which offered options to provide surplus F-16A/Bs as well as younger F-16C/Ds, has been awarded a $500M contract to furnish a dozen D model F-16s to the Croatian Air Force. The competition for the country’s small fighter tender was significant. Three countries offered used F-16s, including the United States, Greece, and Israel. Sweden offered-up the JAS-39C Gripen. In the end Israel won out not with its retired F-16A/Bs ‘Netz’ fighters but with two-seat F-16D ‘Barak’ models, the oldest of which are now 30 years old. Croatia’s defense council said the following on Tuesday according to the Times of Israel : “The defense council… has accepted that Israel made the best offer and gave a recommendation to the government to decide on acquiring.” Israel’s F-16Ds are fully missionized and are capable of the same combat abilities as their single seat stablemates, although the D model carries a bit less fuel internally and has slightly different handling characteristics around the outer edges of its flight envelope. The IAF has roughly 125 Baraks in service, making it still the backbone of the service’s air combat force. Around 48 of those aircraft are two seat D models. IAF F-16D , Efi Elian/Wikicommons Israel has put its F-16C/D fleet through a relatively recent upgrade program that included enhancements to its missions systems, cockpit displays, HUD, and structure. Electronic warfare upgrades were also likely part of this series of modifications and further upgrades, including those needed to make the aircraft fully NATO compatible, are probably included in the package deal with Croatia. Israel’s offering to Croatia morphed significantly over the last 36 months. Originally F-16A/B models were going to be offered, and then a so called mixed fleet that included F-16C/D models was also being considered. Now it seems Croatia selected strictly D models. It’s worth noting that two seat fighter variants are especially prized by the Israeli Air Force. Related Video: The Navy’s legendary hotrod F-16N Viper: According to Defense News , under the contract the first F-16Ds are slated to arrive in Croatia in 2020. It’s not clear what else the package includes, but it’s safe to assume some training and sustainment services are also part of the deal. Israel is in the process of remodeling its aerial fighting force. It has 50 F-35Is on order , the first of which were delivered over a year ago and have since been declared operational . At the same time, the force looks to sustain its legacy F-15A/B/C/D ‘Baz’ fleet of roughly 60 aircraft well into the future. This initiative includes painstakingly converting the oldest F-15Ds built—acquired as surplus from U.S. stocks—to the same unique standard as those in service. Upgrades to the F-15I fleet of just 25 aircraft are also ongoing. But the brunt of the country’s advanced air combat capability still lies in its cadre of 96 F-16Is. Even as F-16C/D models begin to fade within the IAF’s ranks in the coming decades, the F-16I will remain a pivotal player in Israel’s air combat force., IAF The next major fighter acquisition for the IDF could come in the form of new F-15 Strike Eagle derivatives or more F-35s. Most indicators point to a high interest in obtaining the latest configuration of F-15 in the near term and then purchasing more F-35s in the years to come as the F-16C/D fleet is slowly retired. With this in mind, the deal with Croatia seems like a win-win. On one hand Croatia gets highly capable twin-seat F-16s that can be sustained and upgraded by a foreign state other than the United States. At the same time Israel gets to unload some of its older fighters and gets lucrative contracts to support them in the future. The $500M can then be spent on other priorities, including new airframes. Weapon sales, like Python IV air-to-air missiles and Spice guided bombs, are also probably in the works. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0EixHDu002du002dTHs One question that remains is what paint job will these Croatian ‘Baraks’ wear? Desert camouflage won’t do and if their MiG-21s are an indicator, a light gray with checkered tail, or even a green camouflage motif could be in the F-16’s future.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Shadowy CIA-Linked Spy Plane May Be Scouring The Sea For North Korean Sanction Busting,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For weeks now, plane spotters on the ground and those using online flight tracking software have watched the curious activities of a highly modified and effectively unmarked de Havilland Canada Dash-8 surveillance plane as it flies missions from U.S. Air Force bases in Japan. It’s not clear who is operating the aircraft or what it’s doing, but it is reportedly tied to the CIA, and from the plane’s routes and overall configuration, it may be involved in enforcing sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and missile programs . The aircraft, which carries the U.S. civil registration code N599XQ, but it otherwise overall white in color, first began appearing in Japan at Yokota Air Base outside of Tokyo in February 2018. It has since flown out of Kadena Air Base further south on the island of Okinawa, as well, primarily into the East China Sea. Units assigned to Pacific Air Forces , or PACAF, the Air Force’s top command for operations in the Pacific theater, manage operations at both of the bases. A discreet maritime patrol platform Covered in various antennas, humps, and bumps, the aircraft appears to be set up primarily for maritime surveillance, which fits with its recent overwater missions. Underneath the fuselage there is a large gondola, along with a sliding door and various antennas. There are what appear to be flat panel antennas on either side of the rear fuselage and on top there is a randome that almost certainly contains a satellite communications system so the crew to feed information from the plane’s sensors back to base for exploitation in near real time. For maritime patrol missions, the gondola would likely hold a surface search radar or synthetic aperture imagining radar with some type of moving target functionality. This would give the plane the ability to spot ships down below and produce imagery, even through cloud cover or smoke, or at night. 3月4日1306時、秋田沖でのミッションを終え横田R/W18に着陸するRO-6A(DHC-8-315/N599XQ/cn 415/ex N505LL)を、真下から見てみる。 #週刊安全保障 pic.twitter.com/Zfdrtc4vjr — SPAR65 – このRJTYの片隅に (@konatanuki) March 4, 2018 At the rear of the gondola there is also what appears to be a retracted able sensor turret, likely with some combination of electro-optical, infrared, or multi-spectral video cameras. Based on what we know from other similar aircraft , the trap door further forward may have another similar turret or conceal a fixed wide-angle still picture cameras, or some form of multi-camera wide-area surveillance system . Other Dash-8s set up for maritime surveillance or coastal patrol have similar sensor arrangements. Combined with the radar, these cameras would give the crew additional options to examine targets they’ve spotted in order to try and positively identify them or monitor the activities of any crew above deck in a more persistent fashion. Since they produce images based on the electromagnetic signature of an object, which can offer details about what it is made of or the presence of certain substances on its surface, hyper- or multi-spectral cameras may also be able to gather even more information about a specific target. A US Customs and Border Protection Dash-8-based maritime patrol aircraft with a similar large ventral radar and forward mounted sensor turret., CBP The various ventral antennas could point to various types of signals intelligence systems, which could give the aircraft the capability to track and monitor radio and cellphone communications. It may have the ability to geo-locate targets based on those transmissions, as well. In a maritime role, the aircraft likely carries a receiver to pick up transmissions from “ automatic identification system ” transponders, which all commercial cargo ships over 300 tons displacement and all commercial passenger ships of any size are supposed to carry to help avoid accidents and otherwise aid in safe navigation. If a ship matching that description isn’t sending out those signals, its a possible indication of illicit activity. Another feature that offers evidence of an overwater mission set is an air deflector near the rear cargo door. This helps protect anyone standing in the doorway during flight and reduces turbulence that could cause trouble when throwing something – such smoke flare to mark an area or target of interest or some sort of rescue kit – out of the airplane. A number of maritime patrol or coast guard Dash-8s have the same feature for exactly this reason. 3月13日0952時、横田R/W18を離陸するRO-6A(DHC-8-315/N599XQ) #週刊安全保障 pic.twitter.com/ITfilj5LGy — SPAR65 – このRJTYの片隅に (@konatanuki) March 13, 2018 Enforcing sanctions? Based on this configuration and its orbits in the East China Sea, it seems very likely that this plane is in someway involved in looking for instances where North Korea is violating of international sanctions . The United Nations Security Council has approved these steadily more extensive regulations on North Korea’s imports and exports in response to the country’s provocative ballistic missile tests and nuclear weapons program . Among the many methods it uses to get around these restrictions, the government in Pyongyang has adopted the novel practice of having North Korean-flagged ships transfer goods to other neutral vessels at sea. Since November 2017 , the United States and Japanese governments have both publicly released aerial surveillance and satellite imagery confirming this practice. Chinese vessels and shipping concerns are heavily implicated in these activities and in 2017, the United States specifically sanctioned of individuals and businesses in China for enabling Pyongyang’s activities. China’s government has repeatedly denied that it aiding North Korea in this endeavor as a matter of state policy, but it remains an ally of Kim Jong-un’s regime and recently hosted the brutal dictator for meetings with Chinese premier Xi Jinping and other senior officials. What appears to be aerial surveillance imagery of a North Korea ship exchanging cargo at sea with another vessel to avoid international sanctions., US Treasury Department Online flight tracking software has shown N599XQ flying obvious search routes in the East China Sea, which would be the most likely route for North Korean ships to meet up with vessels operating from Chinese ports. On March 28, 2017, the aircraft appeared over international waters off the coast of Shanghai, one of China’s largest maritime trading hubs. The month before, Japanese authorities said one of the country’s own P-3C Orion maritime patrol planes had spotted illicit North Korean activity in that same general area. Who’s doing the flying? At the time of writing, PACAF has not responded to our requests for more information about N599XQ, including whether or not the Air Force owns the aircraft or is responsible for its operations under contract, or if the plane belongs to another U.S. or foreign government agency. However, a review of publicly available information suggests the plane may be linked to the U.S. Intelligence Community, and the CIA specifically, or operated by contractors on its behalf. 3月26日1150時、横田R/W18A2をタキシングするRO-6A(DHC-8-315B/N599XQ) ミッションのため嘉手納に向かった。 同日0849時にR/W18を離陸、上昇中の492SOW/524SOSのC-146A(Do328-110/99-3106,ex/N525EF) 前日夜に飛来、シェミアに向かった。 #週刊安全保障 pic.twitter.com/tO9f6ug74C — SPAR65 – このRJTYの片隅に (@konatanuki) March 26, 2018 Prior to receiving the N599XQ registration, this Dash-8 belonged to Path Corporation as N505LL .

But whatever Path Corporation’s ties to the rendition program might have been, this particular aircraft appears to have been configured for aerial surveillance missions since at least 2003, when a plane spotter grabbed a picture of the then N505LL, with an overall white paint scheme with a blue cheatline, at the main international airport in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. At that time, it had two sliding doors underneath its fuselage to cover sensor systems when not in use and no ventral gondola. It also eventually received mission launch detection sensors indicating that whoever the operator was expected the aircraft to go into potentially hostile areas. Those remain on the aircraft to this day and the addition of a small black retractable turret underneath suggests that its self-defense suite may now include a directional infrared countermeasure system, or DIRCM , to confuse incoming heat-seeking missiles. There is no clear indication from those early pictures that the aircraft carried any additional sensors for overland surveillance, but it may have had some ability to spot and monitor hostile communications without the need for a large, visible antenna farm. Various types of similarly-sized U.S. Army intelligence aircraft have had and continue to employ equally discreet systems. A graphic showing the internal configurations of the Army’s three types of Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL) aircraft, including the ARL-I with a retractable sensor turret and the ARL-C with a communications intelligence suite and limited external antennas. These aircraft used the older, four engine de Havilland Canada DHC-7 platform., US Army A multiple camera arrangement, especially one including dedicated systems able to capture persistent imagery across wide areas, is already particularly well suited to developing so-called “ patterns of life ” in relation to small groups or specific individuals. This can allow analysts the better understand their routines and movements, connecting them to other subjects of interest or determining when it might be best to strike at or capture them with the smallest amount of risk to innocent bystanders. Being able to also intercept their communities only helps intelligence personnel build a more complete understanding of those activities. An aircraft with these capabilities would have been a essential for the CIA’s own efforts in early the War on Terror, which have continued and may now be expanding again , often tangential to covert U.S. military special operations forces operations . The aircraft also lacked the deflector at the rear cargo door, but it still would have been suitable for low-profile missions to insert, extract, or resupply covert teams. The plane in its present configuration may also have this kind of special operations support capability. It’s also worth noting that after the registration change to N599XQ in 2016, the aircraft retained more or less the same configuration, but received a new paint job with a red instead of blue cheatline, which eventually gave way to the overall white scheme. This is how it arrived in Japan earlier in 2018 and it only emerged with the new maritime-focused sensor suite in late February after having flown what appeared to be extensive training sorties around Yokota. Why send this plane to Japan? It’s not entirely clear why this type of mission would require the services such a secretive aircraft. The sanctions against North Korea and enforcing them are a public matter with an international mandate from the United Nations. As we at The War Zone have noted before , there is an impressive array of U.S. military intelligence and maritime reconnaissance aircraft in and around the Korean Peninsula at any one time, as well, that could provide similar capabilities. The U.S. Navy’s P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon patrol planes in particular are purpose built for similar overwater missions. Part of the issue there may be that military aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance resources are already stretched thin trying to monitor North Korea’s missile – and nuclear-related activities along with existing routine duties , including challenging Chinese territorial claims , monitoring foreign naval surface and submarine activities , and being on call for search and rescue missions. Earlier in March 2018, U.S. Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees all American military operations throughout the Pacific region, pointedly complained to members of Congress about his lack of aerial intelligence capacity. A US Navy P-3C Orion., USN “I don’t have enough because there isn’t enough to go around,” the admiral said, referring specifically to U.S. Air Force RC-135V/W Rivet Joint signals intelligence and WC-135 Constant Phoenix nuclear intelligence platforms and Navy P-3s. He added that these three types of aircraft were “critical to intelligence collection” with regards to North Korea. So N599XQ’s flights may be a matter of convenience. The U.S. military has long employed contractor-owned and operated surveillance aircraft to expand its intelligence gathering capabilities in response to pressing needs. The twin-engine Dash-8’s range and relatively low operating costs have also made that platform increasingly attractive for persistent surveillance missions on land and over water. Notably, the omnibus spending bill President Donald Trump signed earlier in March 2018 specifically included nearly $70 million in funding for the procurement of additional Dash-8-based U.S. Army Saturn Arch and U.S. Air Force Pale Ale aircraft. A US Army Saturn Arch Dash-8., Bill Word There may also be an obtuse bureaucratic component to N599XQ’s activities. The U.S. Treasury Department is one of the primary U.S. government entities tasked with enforcing sanctions and there may be legal or regulatory hurdles in mixing its civilian activities with those of the U.S. military. This seems unlikely, though, given that the Pentagon and the various branches have well established mechanisms to support civil law enforcement operations, such as counter-drug missions . On top of that, the imagery the U.S. and Japanese governments have released of alleged North Korean at-sea transfers dates to at least October 2017, months before N599XQ arrived in Japan. Unclassified imagery from December 2017 showing a North Korean ship apparently transferring cargo to a Panamanian-flagged vessel., US Treasury Department So other aircraft have been performing the mission already. But the time necessary to get approval and find available assets could still have been a determining factor in the decision to approach another civilian agency about providing this support. And there’s always the possibility the plane is flying missions unrelated to sanctions against North Korea specifically or to that country at all, though the timing and location of the flights suggest otherwise. But whatever the N599XQ is doing and for what U.S. or foreign government agency, the aircraft has been and continues to be quite active in the East China Sea. We’ll be continuing to keep an eye on its activities and will keep you updated if we find out more about this mysterious aircraft and its most recent mission.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",One of Afghanistan’s A-29s Has Finally Dropped a Laser-Guided Bomb in Anger,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One of the Afghan Air Force’s A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft has finally dropped a laser-guided bomb in combat. That the pilot chose to employ a precision weapon for fear of hitting nearby civilians underscores the importance of the capability, despite the NATO-led international coalition continuing to downplay its significance , even as it celebrates this achievement. On March 22, 2018, an A-29 from the Kabul Air Wing’s detachment at Kandahar Airfield dropped a pair of GBU-58/B 250-pound class Paveway series laser-guided bombs on a Taliban-controlled compound in the country’s western Farah province. The plane was reportedly carrying unguided Mk 81 bombs, as well. Crews only began training to employ the weapons in December 2017, a detail that the War Zone was first to report . Afghan pilot walks to an awaiting A-29 loaded with unguided rockets and bombs., USAF “The Afghan pilots have learned their trade during combat and our advisors have expanded their skills in a deliberate step by step approach,” U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Phillip Stewart, the American officer commander in charge of NATO’s Train Advise, Assist Command-Air (TAAC-A), said in a statement . “This recent laser guided bomb strike is an example of the success of the AAF and TAAC-Air’s efforts.” To be sure, the ability of Afghanistan’s A-29 crews to drop GBU-58/Bs on the Taliban is an important development. It’s an essential capability for exactly these sorts of situations in which a less precise weapon could pose a serious risk to innocent bystanders. The same benefits apply in instances where friendly forces find themselves dangerously close to the enemy. These issues are only magnified in populated areas, where it might be especially difficult to easily separate hostile personnel from civilians over the course of a fluid battle. The laser-guided bombs also offer the aircraft a way to precisely attack moving targets. On top of that, the ability for Afghan Super Tucanos to employ laser-guided bombs also means that they may finally be able to use the aircraft’s own sensor turret or actively coordinate with other suitable equipped aircraft, manned or unmanned, or troops on the ground to designate the target. Combined with training to fly with the aid of night-vision goggles, this capability is essential to be able to operate at night when insurgents and terrorists are typically most active. But as significant as this achievement might be, it has now created something of a rhetorical trap for the NATO-led coalition, also known as the Resolute Support Mission. In December 2017, when the Afghan Air Force still had yet to employ a precision guided munition in combat, officials insisted that this wasn’t an issue since Afghan pilots were capable of being as accurate as they needed to be with unguided bombs. They are compelled to make the same arguments now, even as they laud this milestone. Afghan Air Force ground crewmen practice assembling a GBU-58/B bomb on an A-29 using an practice bomb body in July 2017. , USAF “The AAF has demonstrated again and again that their pilots, using the A-29 and the skills they have learned from our advisors and perfected through combat experience, that they can drop non-precision weapons within 10 meters [approximately 11 yards] of their targets,” Brigadier General Phillip Stewart said. “There are certain targets that require laser guided bombs and the AAF has shown it can accomplish that task now as well.” This assertion seemed questionable before and seems even more so now. In the strike video the Resolute Support Mission released along with its announcement, seen above, the enclosure with the target building, which sits entirely by itself, appears to be easily longer than 12 yards across. When the bomb hits, the entire walled compound is filled with smoke and dust. The civilians the pilot or personnel on the ground were worried about hitting were unlikely to have been inside at the time. And yet the pilot still elected to drop a precision guided bomb on the target rather than test their ability to place an unguided bomb in the right place. It can only call into question how reliably Afghan Super Tucano crews are actually able to meet that 11 yard standard of accuracy and how much this may have impacted the scope and effectiveness of their operations since 2016 when the first planes arrived in country. Members of the Afghan Air Force assemble unguided Mk 81 bombs., USAF Per NATO’s own statistics , Afghan A-29s aborted nearly one out of every five attack runs between April and December 2016 over concerns about hitting innocent civilians or friendly troops, or just not being able to positively identify the target at all. That discretion is commendable, but it might not have been necessary had they been able to use GBU-58/Bs at the time. There’s no additional information about whether the inability to follow through with those strikes allowed the enemy to escape or could have translated to additional friendly casualties, either. The Afghan Army, as well as the country’s various police forces, has consistently had worryingly high casualty rates in general. If the A-29’s precision guided muntions capability was so irrelevant, it also worth asking why the U.S.-backed Afghan Aviation Transition Plan includes the procurement of nearly three dozen AC-208 Eliminators with the ability to fire 2.75-inch Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II ( APKWS II ) laser-guided rockets. Afghanistan is set to get the first three of these aircraft, which will also have a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared cameras and a laser designator, in 2018. https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPXh0SpQU6w The truth is, as it has always been, that dumb bombs, no matter how accurate their employment might be , are simply no substitute for precision guided munitions or the kind of capabilities they offer.  It’s a capability the Afghan Air Force could definitely have benefited from in the past two years and it remains unclear how many aircraft are capable of employing laser-guided bombs and how many crews are qualified to do so at present. None of this is perhaps surprising given the conclusions of a damning review the Department of Defense’s own top watchdog released in January 2018 that criticized almost every major aspect of the TAAC-A operation. The advisers “could not measure the Afghan Air Force’s progress towards a defined end-state specifying the intended set of Afghan Air Force capabilities,” according to the report. The NATO coalition continues to highlight growing the Afghan Air Force’s size and capabilities as essential to curtailing Taliban gains across the country and perhaps finding some sort of end state for an increasingly intractable conflict. Based on all the available evidence , it seems like the service and its foreign advisers still have a long way to go in their efforts to craft a functional air arm that can realistically take any of the pressure off American airpower in the country. At least the crews of Afghan Air Force’s A-29s may now increasingly have the option to drop laser-guided bombs on their targets, nearly three years after they first began flying the aircraft in combat.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 8, 2018",Why Would Kim Jong Un Take An Armored Train To Beijing? (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Many signs point to a real possibility that Kim Jong Un has made a visit to Beijing aboard a heavily armored train very similar to the ones his father and grandfather constantly used. If Kim is indeed in the Chinese capital, it marks his first trip abroad in over six years since becoming the dictator of North Korea. It could also be an indicator of certain political realities back home and it raises the question of who is in charge of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal when the young despot is away. Wings Versus Rails First off, Kim’s possible use of a train instead of an aircraft to travel to Beijing is very strange. Simply put, he loves to fly and has had a fascination with aircraft since he was a child. The country’s aging IL-62M VVIP transports have been upgraded with modern executive interiors in recent years to accommodate foreign missions. Even Kim’s sister recently used one of these aircraft to travel to South Korea for the Olympics. It’s possible that these aircraft are currently unserviceable, but Kim could just as easily take one of two An-148s that he uses to move around the country and even fly (or at least pretend he is flying) from time to time. Even though the country has been hit very hard by sanctions and fuel reserves are supposedly tight, such a high-level mission would clearly be a priority and one would think that China would send a plane if North Korea didn’t have one that is serviceable. It’s possible that the lack of total control over the asset could cause major security concerns for Kim’s personal security apparatus, especially as Chinese and North Korean relations have entered a chilly state as of late. It’s also possible that China could not supply the aircraft due to a tight sanctions regime it is supposedly abiding by. But still, a train, even an armored one, has its own security and logistical challenges. Even when Kim has traveled by air it has been domestic flights only since becoming ruler of North Korea. Here he is seen aboard a VVIP configured IL-62M. During this mission he flew over Pyongyang to look at a large development project. , North Korea State Media Travel by rail could provide Kim with a higher level of connectivity and control during his transit, but that transit could take days instead of just a couple hours by air. We just don’t know what would have prompted such a decision, even if it’s not Kim onboard but a very high ranking member of his administration, the use of a train seems odd. It is also possible that certain intelligence could have also impacted the decision, as the regime is notoriously paranoid about a decapitation strike . Keep An Eye On The Place For Me Considering that this would mark Kim Jong Un’s first trip abroad as supreme leader of North Korea, one has to wonder who is in charge of the country’s nuclear arsenal while he is gone. North Korea has claimed that Kim has unilateral control of the country’s nuclear weapons, even going as far as saying he has a button on his desk that can swiftly order an attack. North Korea would have to rely on commercial or possibly Chinese military communications satellites for long-range command and control while Kim is abroad, both of which are vulnerable to disruption or even exploitation. With this in mind, it is worrisome to ponder what safeguards are left in place in his absence and who now has such destructive power at their fingertips. Exactly how succession works in the North Korean regime, or who else has the authority to order a nuclear strike, remains unknown.  , AP The young ruler’s decision to leave his country at this time is also telling. He must feel comfortable enough in his own power to exit the country at such a tumultuous time. With U.S. and South Korean intelligence communities having only an opaque view into the inner workings of the regime, it isn’t clear if everyone is onboard with Kim’s abrupt change of course when it comes to foreign relations. For hardliners, inviting the American president for talks may seem like a catastrophic and dangerous move, one that could endanger their individual purpose in a future North Korea. The regime relies on a constant existential threat from beyond its borders to keep its iron grip over its populace. Without grand enemies to point to the regime’s power cold rapidly erode. In fact, it could endanger the very fabric of North Korean society, one that has been taught that Americans are literally monsters for the better part of a century. For the old guard in North Korea’s ruling elite, their business is a military standoff, without it their positions and wealth could be in jeopardy. Even after a series of brutal purges that lasted roughly between 2014 and 2016, where Kim executed or removed long-serving officials with deep ties to China, and with potentially opposing visions for the country, it isn’t certain, especially at this chaotic time, that there aren’t still factions that want to see him removed from power. As such, leaving to China, which has also grown weary of Kim’s leadership, would seem to be a risky move unless he was totally certain that his grip on power is assured. With all this in mind, this trip to China would have to of been incredibly important for the impatient leader to board a slow-moving armored train in order to attend. And why now? What does China or Kim need to say to each other face-to-face? Does China want a seat at the table during the talks between Trump and Kim ? Are they concerned about what Kim may or may not be willing to concede? The relationship between North Korea and China is utterly complex, but North Korea does represent a junk yard dog of sorts for China that can be strategically set loose to distract the U.S. or even open a second fighting front during a potential conflict between Beijing and Washington. At the same time, it’s clear that Kim’s accelerated nuclear and missile programs , and his flippant behavior, have endangered the stability of the region—something that China is not keen on. We will have to wait and see if Kim truly did make the rail voyage to Beijing, but as you can see, there is much more here to ponder than just the historic nature of the possible visit. In an unprecedented move, Kim meets with top South Korean diplomats in February., AP North Korean Rulers On Rails North Korea’s armored VVIP trains are a staple of the Kim family’s reign. They have traveled as far from home as Eastern Europe in them and Kim Jong Un’s dad, Kim Jong Il, used them almost exclusively to move around North Korea as he had an acute fear of flying. In fact, in 2011 he died while traveling on one of his armored trains which were notorious for their extensive inventory of luxury food and alcohol. Kim Jong Il boards an identical train in Beijing during a visit to China in 2011. , AFP/Getty Images These trains are not comprised of just a locomotive and a few cars, they are up to two dozen cars long and can include bookend decoy, route clearing, and rear guard security trains as well. The VVIP cars are supposedly very lavishly appointed, with ornate saloon cars, staterooms and dining facilities. These trains also pack critical communications gear, spaces for a small army of heavily armed guards, as well plenty of room for support staff and the VVIP’s aids. Cargo cars can carry armored vehicles and other outsized loads. There is supposedly a fleet of roughly six of these trains made up of nearly 100 cars in total that resides primarily in Pyongyang when they are not in use. It is widely rumored that some highly remote bunker facilities are only accessible by rail or helicopter, making these trains more than just a mode of diplomatic and administrative transport for the regime, they are a key element in North Korea’s continuity of government planning and are potentially intrinsic to the regime’s survival during a crisis. The use of specialized trains to move leaders of nations around is a centuries old practice. The War Zone has detailed the historical use of trains to move American Presidents, but in this day and age the practice is becoming exceedingly rare. Still, North Korea is a time capsule of sorts and their military apparatus knows how to execute VVIP rail operations exceedingly well from decades of experience, so it does remain a viable mode of transportation even for the highest rungs of the regime. We aren’t likely to get confirmation that Kim did indeed visit Beijing until his train is safely back in Pyongyang, if at all depending on the nature of the meeting. The motorcade that supposedly whisked the VVIP off to an estate outside of Beijing that is known to be used to house visiting foreign dignitaries, including Kim’s father in the past, was massive in size. In fact it looked very similarly configured as a U.S. presidential motorcade, the anatomy of which you can read all about here . We will update this post over the next 12 hours if more information on this mysterious overnight visit by rail emerges. Update: 5:00pm PST— We have confirmation that Kim was indeed in Beijing and met with President Xi Jinping during his official state visit. He was accompanied by his wife as well and the trip lasted from Sunday to Wednesday.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Mar 22, 2018",Houthis Film Attempted Downing Of UAE F-16s Amid Claims They’ve Gotten New Iranian Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For the second time in as many weeks , the Houthis in Yemen claim they have successfully challenged aircraft belonging to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the skies over the country, saying they drove off a pair of F-16E/F Viper fighter jets belonging to the United Arab Emirates with surface-to-air missiles . Though its difficult to confirm any reports coming out of Yemen, it seems that the rebel group is increasingly capable of engaging its aerial opponents, amid reports that it may be receiving additional support for its air defense forces from Iran. On March 27, 2018, the Houthis released a video showing the operation through social media and other outlets, including via Yemen’s Al Masirah television network, which the group controls. The clip shows a unknown type of missile speeding into the night’s sky, followed by footage of at least one F-16 that the rebels shot with a FLIR Systems infrared camera. The insurgents have used this equipment, an American-made system that they likely captured or otherwise obtained from former Yemeni government elements, to film attacks on aircraft in the past. Unlike in past incidents, the Houthis have not claimed that they actually shot any UAE F-16s down, but imply that they were able to prevent them from completing their missions. It is not clear from the footage whether or not this was the case or if any missiles scored hits. In one instance a missile appears to narrowly miss its intended target. There is a debris cloud visible at one point in the clip, which could indicate some level of damage to a Viper, but may also be the remnants of one or more of the decoy flares the aircraft fired off during the engagement or of a missile that detonated by accident. https://youtube.com/watch?v=waUHC5h-Nb4 We also don’t know what type of missiles the Houthis employed in this case. Evidence suggests the group has a mix of purpose built and locally modified systems, including various air-to-air missiles they captured from government stockpiles and turned into surface-to-air weapons. On March 21, 2018, the group did reportedly fire a modified Russian-made R-27 air-to-air missile at a Saudi F-15 Eagle, possibly causing some level of damage. Saudi Arabian authorities later said that the aircraft had been able to finish its mission and safely return to base . A UAE F-16F., USAF The bigger concern, however, is that the rebels may be in the process of obtaining radar-guided surface-to-air missiles from Iran or have done so already. Following a Houthi ballistic missile attack on Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh on March 26, 2018, that country’s government displayed captured weapons and remnants thereof, as well as other intelligence imagery and information about apparent Iranian arms shipments to the group. This presentation included claims that Iran had supplied a number of Sayyad-2 surface-to-air missiles, an extended range derivative of the semi-active radar-homing American RIM-66 Standard Missile , to the Yemeni insurgents. The Saudis also said they had a destroyed a Sayyad-2 launcher situated near the main airport in Yemen’s capital Sana’a. If confirmed, this would represent a major increase in Houthi air defense capabilities, offering better range and precision over existing jury-rigged air-to-air missiles, obsolete Soviet-era systems , and short-range man-portable types . However, the imagery Saudi Arabia said one of its unmanned aircraft had captured of the launch position showed what actually appeared to be one of the Houthi’s Badr-1 truck-mounted unguided artillery rocket systems, though there is the possibility the rebels adapted this vehicle to fire the new missiles. The pictures of the missiles themselves that the Saudis showed were from official Iranian releases. But whether or not there are Sayyad-2s in Yemen in any numbers, there is growing evidence that Iran is assisting the Houthis with the development of various types of missiles, including short-range ballistic missiles , and other more advanced weaponry. Iranian help may be tied to the group’s ability to employ anti-ship missiles , remote-controlled suicide boats , and kamikaze drones that can target air defense systems. Above all else, their ability to consistently deploy ever more capable ballistic missiles is blamed on Iranian support. Former Yemeni military personnel, who have at times allied themselves with the Houthis as a matter of convenience , could also be aiding in fabricating these weapons. And regardless of how successful the Houthis actually were in their attempt to shoot down the UAE’s F-16s in this instance, it shows that they remained determined to fight back against the Saudi-led coalition’s overwhelming air superiority. It seems that the countries involved in the aerial campaign will increasingly have to take these threats into account.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Oct 9, 2018",US Army Eyes Adding Unique 40mm Cannon To Its Stryker and Bradley Armored Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With its increasing emphasis on being prepared for a high-end ground conflict against a conventional opponent, particularly a skirmish with Russia or its proxies in Europe, the United States Army is adding 30mm cannons to some of its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles and is considering putting that same weapon on upgraded tracked Bradley Fighting Vehicles . Now, defense contractor CTA International, or CTAI, is pitching the idea of arming those vehicles, and future designs, with a larger, 40mm weapon to give them even more firepower. On March 21, 2018, BAE Systems demonstrated CTAI’s 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon to Army officials at Fort Benning, Georgia, which is presently home to the service’s Infantry and Armor schools. Company representatives and service members fired a total of 80 rounds and the weapon experienced no malfunctions. CTAI, which has its base of operations in France, is a 50-50 joint venture between U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems and the French Nexter Systems. “I think there is going to be interest to let [the Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center] look at the weapon in some more detail,” Rory Chamberlain, a BAE Systems business development manager, told reporters after the live-fire event, according to Defense News . “It’s a mature cannon.” CTAI has been working on the system since 1994 and has successfully demonstrated it in a variety of configurations. The United Kingdom and France have selected the weapon as the main armament for their upcoming Ajax and EBRC Jaguar armored vehicles, respectively. General Dynamics UK’s Ajax, which has the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon as its main armament., Crown Copyright. It’s an advanced and innovative design overall, but its primary benefits are in the basic size and construction of the 40mm cased telescoped ammunition. A cased telescoped round means that the actual projectile sits inside the cartridge case with the propellant instead of protruding from the front. As a result, the 40mm cased telescoped cartridges are roughly half the length of other 40mm rounds on the market and are even shorter than the 30mm rounds for the XM813 Bushmaster II gun the Army is testing on its up-gunned Strykers, also known as Dragoons . The beer-can shaped ammunition is wider overall, though. This makes them easier to handle and store within the generally cramped confines of an armored vehicle. The video below offers a good visual overview of CTAI’s Cased Telescoped Cannon and its ammunition. CTAI’s gun also uses an innovative rotating breach design that feeds in ammunition from the side and then rotates 90 degrees to align it with the barrel and form a secure pressure seal. After the weapon fires the shot, the system rotates open again and new round feeds in, pushing the empty casing out the other end. A computerized fire control system handles the entire process. It can determine where certain types of ammunition are within the self-contained magazine, which can hold between 70 and 100 rounds depending on its configuration, and move them into firing position. This allows the gunner to load specific rounds rapidly to engage different targets. An infographic laying out various features of the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon and its ammunition., BAE Systems At present, CTAI offers six different types of ammunition to go along with the gun. These include anti-tank, anti-personnel and material, and specialized anti-aircraft rounds , along with a pair of training types. The dedicated anti-tank round contains a high-velocity, solid metal dart to punch through more than five and half inches of rolled homogenous armor at ranges of more than 1,500 yards. This gives the weapon the ability to take out armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and older Cold War-era tanks, such as the Soviet T-55, which still remain in service around the world. A slide from a 2009 CTAI presentation showing the relative anti-armor capabilities of its 40mm cannon compared with other armament options., CTAI There are cartridges with high-explosive air-burst and point-detonating projectiles for attacking personnel, unarmored vehicles, and fortified positions. The weapon system’s ammunition selection function also allows pairing these effects together in rapid sequence. According to Defense News, during the demonstration, BAE Systems showed how a vehicle armed with the cannon might fire a point-detonating shell into the wall of house to create a hole, before firing a pair of airburst rounds through that gap to kill enemy forces inside. Another simulated scenario involved shooting an airburst round over a main battle tank to blind its optical sensors, followed by an anti-armor round. Cutaways of the 40mm cased telescoped point-detonating round, at left, and airburst type, at right, showing how the projecile is nestled inside the propellant in the cartridge case., CTAI The standard mount for the gun also allows for a high-angle of fire, which allows a vehicle armed with the system to potentially engage low- and slow-flying aircraft, helicopters, and drones. It’s also a boon for fighting in dense urban areas , where other vehicles might not necessarily be able to engage targets in the upper stories of buildings from narrow streets below. A dedicated anti-aircraft cartridge filled with 200 tungsten pellets gives the cannon a better chance of scoring a hit and the potential to more realistically engage small unmanned aircraft, a growing threat that both large nation state military forces and non-state terrorists and insurgents are employing with increasing sophistication . It seems hard to imagine that this oversized shotgun shell wouldn’t be useful against enemy personnel in the open, as well. The uniform size means any vehicle with the cannon should be able to fire any new rounds that come along in the future. CTAI has been exploring a number of different types, including precision guided munitions, which might give the cannon a limited indirect fire capability, akin to an infantry mortar, when coupled with the high-angle capability. And with the compact ammunition, the gun’s breech assembly can also be shorter, reducing the overall length of the gun, again an important consideration when it comes to the space constraints of an armored vehicle’s turret. The 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon is similar in overall size to the Bushmaster II and should be able to fit in any turret that can accommodate the smaller weapon with relative ease. A Stryker Dragoon with the XM813 30mm cannon. BAE Systems suggests CTAI’s 40mm cannon should be able to fit inside this turret with relative ease., US Army BAE hopes that this detail, combined with the gun’s various features, will make the weapon especially attractive to the Army. The service is evaluating the Strykers Dragoons with the 30mm XM813, but hasn’t yet decided whether it will adopt that combination for widespread use. “From our point of view, Stryker lethality is open,” BAE’s Chamberlain said in a separate interview with Defense Daily. “As much as they’ve got the Dragoon … the lethality and the requirements are still to be decided.” The Army is also looking at options for adding a new gun to the Bradley and has been leaning toward using the Bushmaster II in that case, as well. But if that upgrade requires a new, larger turret, then the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon could easily be another option, as well. BAE Systems has the benefit there of being the present manufacturer of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family. In addition, CTIA demonstrated it could fit the larger gun onto that vehicle all the way back in 1999 . A Bradley test bed armed with the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon in 1999., CTAI And if the company can get the cannon onto those vehicles, it might be able to leverage that experience into a pitch to arm at least some of the Army’s still largely conceptual family of Next-Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCV) with the weapon. This program is seeking to develop an entirely new grouping of armored vehicles to replace existing Strykers, Bradleys, and M1 tanks, among others. The service is still hashing out the most basic of those requirements, but has said that it is actively looking to field manned-unmanned teams to replace existing armored formations. The Army wants the first experimental vehicles – two manned and four unmanned – by the end of 2019 and ready for evaluations by the beginning of 2020. Modified M113 armored personnel carriers will initially fill the role of the unmanned ground vehicles, as they already have in other tests , but the two manned systems will be all-new designs. The goal is for those experiments to inform development of a full company-size fleet of purpose-built vehicle, which would arrive by 2023. The Army wants to actually field NGCVs by 2028. An artists conception of an NGCV that could replace the Army’s M1 Abrams, showing a larger bore main gun, remote weapon stations, Trophy active protection systems , and what appears to be a self-defense directed energy weapon , among other notional features., US Army “There is a lot of talk about the NGCV and where that goes,” Chamberlain noted after the So in an unmanned configuration on a Stryker, manned configuration on a Bradley and NGCV, who knows what that is going to be… We are looking at that.” If the Army can keep to its aggressive development schedule, we may start seeing more robust concepts for the new vehicles soon. Depending on how impressed the service was by the demonstration at Fort Benning, some of the proposed designs might feature the larger 40mm cannon.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Apr 21, 2018",Lockheed Martin Now Has a Patent For Its Potentially World Changing Fusion Reactor,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed Martin has quietly obtained a patent associated with its design for a potentially revolutionary compact fusion reactor, or CFR. If this project has been progressing on schedule, the company could debut a prototype system that size of shipping container, but capable of powering a Nimitz -class aircraft carrier or 80,000 homes, sometime in the next year or so. The patent , for a portion of the confinement system, or embodiment, is dated Feb. 15, 2018. The Maryland-headquartered defense contractor had filed a provisional claim on April 3, 2013 and a formal application nearly a year later. Our good friend Stephen Trimble , chief of Flightglobal’s Americas Bureau, subsequently spotted it and Tweeted out its basic details. In 2014, the company also made a splash by announcing they were working on the device at all and that it was the responsibility of its Skunk Works advanced projects office in Palmdale, California. At the time , Dr. Thomas McGuire, head of the Skunk Works’ Compact Fusion Project , said the goal was to have a working reactor in five years and production worthy design within 10. “I studied this in graduate school [at MIT] where, under a NASA study, I was charged with how we could get to Mars quickly,” McGuire said back in 2014 in an interview with Aviation Week . “I started looking at all the ideas that had been published. I basically took those ideas and melded them into something new by taking the problems in one and trying to replace them with the benefits of others.” Since the 1920s, scientists have been working on fusion reactor concepts, but unfortunately most the functional examples have been inefficient and large – typically the size of small building – as well as exceptionally expensive. For example, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , which an international consortium is building in France and expects to have ready in 2021, has an estimated total cost of $50 billion and has a design that will weight approximately 23,000 tons . Below is a video presentation that Lockheed Martin released in 2014 in which Dr. McGuire explains the basics of nuclear fusion and his reactor design. This has largely relegated these devices to experimental, rather than practical purposes, and confining the reaction – the same one that occurs inside the sun or other stars – is at the heart of the issue. Unlike in nuclear fission , where atoms hit each other release energy, a fusion reaction involves heating up a gaseous fuel to the point where its atomic structure gets disrupted from the pressure and some of the particles fuse into a heavier nucleus. The process involves the release of a massive amount of energy, a million times more than a typical chemical reaction, such a burning a fossil fuel, according to McGuire. But to do this you need to be able to hold the gas, which is eventually in a highly energized plasma state , for a protracted period of time at a temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees Fahrenheit. This generally limits the potential for reactors, even large ones, because of concerns they might fail spectacularly. In the 2014 interview with Aviation Week, McGuire used tokamaks , a magnetic confinement device scientists in the Soviet Union first invented in the 1950s, as an example, stating that they had a low magnetic pressure limit under which they could safely operate. A schematic of McGuire’s reactor design., Lockheed Martin With McGuire’s help, the article succinctly explained , at least in theory, how the CFR was supposed to get around these issues: “The problem with tokamaks is that “they can only hold so much plasma, and we call that the beta limit,” McGuire says. Measured as the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure, the beta limit of the average tokamak is low, or about “5% or so of the confining pressure,” he says. Comparing the torus to a bicycle tire, McGuire adds, ‘if they put too much in, eventually their confining tire will fail and burst—so to operate safely, they don’t go too close to that.’ … The CFR will avoid these issues by tackling plasma confinement in a radically different way. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. ‘So for us, instead of a bike tire expanding into air, we have something more like a tube that expands into an ever-stronger wall,’ McGuire says. The system is therefore regulated by a self-tuning feedback mechanism, whereby the farther out the plasma goes, the stronger the magnetic field pushes back to contain it. The CFR is expected to have a beta limit ratio of one. ‘We should be able to go to 100% or beyond,’ he adds.” If the system works, it’s hard to underscore just how dramatically it could change not just the future of warfare, but the basic nature of human existence. Running on approximately 25 pounds of fuel – a mixture of hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium – Lockheed Martin estimated the notional reactor would be able to run for an entire year without stopping. The device would be able to generate a constant 100 megawatts of power during that period. According to the company website on the CFR, the reactor could be powerful enough to run an aircraft carrier , power a plane the size of a C-5 Galaxy airlifter , provide electricity to cities with anywhere from 50 to 100,000 people, and maybe even speed up a trip to Mars. In each case, the compact reactor would take the place of large conventional fuel systems or fission reactors, eliminating weight and bulk. This in turn could create trade space for additional system or carrying capacity in terms of personnel or materiel or potentially allow for a more energy efficient overall shape or design. A schematic depicting the basic external shape of the proposed fusion reactor design from the recently approved patent., USPTO For aviation applications, depending on the exact size of the reactor, the system might be able to give a plane unlimited range for its entire lifecycle, with the limit only been the need for food, water, and other life support systems for the crew. High altitude drones with the ability to stay aloft for months or even years at a time could potentially take the place of satellites and other communications relay infrastructure for both military and civilian applications. This could also translate to persistent surveillance over broad areas where it might otherwise be difficult to monitor things by air, such as in the vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean , more or less indefinitely, which could be useful for tasks range from tracking potential enemy movements to observing changes in animal populations or water temperature. Those same benefits could apply to vehicles on land, ships at sea, or craft in space, providing nearly unlimited power in compact form allowing for operations across large areas, effectively eliminating the tyranny of distance in many cases. Again, for military applications, unmanned ground vehicles or ships could patrol indefinitely far removed from traditional logistics chains and satellites could conduct long-term, resource intensive activities without the need for large and potentially dangerous fission reactors . A basic schematic from the patent of a notional engine and reactor arrangement on a four-engine jet aircraft using the CFR., USPTO Therein lies perhaps the biggest potential benefits of nuclear fusion over fission. It’s produces no emissions dangerous to the ozone layer and if the system fails it doesn’t pose nearly the same threat of a large scale radiological incident. Both deuterium and tritium are commonly found in a number of regular commercial applications and are relatively harmless in low doses. The small amount of fuel necessary to run a fusion reactor inherently reduces that chances that a leak would contaminate a wide area in the event of an accident. And since a fusion reactor doesn’t need refined fissile material, its much harder for it to serve as a starting place for a nuclear weapons program. This in turn could make it a more readily exportable and efficient power source, employable anywhere in the world to provide reliable electricity for hospitals, schools, desalination plants, and other important, but often power hungry elements of civil infrastructure. Fuel would also be abundant and relatively easy to source, since sea water provides a nearly unlimited source of deuterium, while there are ready sources of lithium to provide the starting place for scientists to “breed” tritium. The waste products are much less difficult to manage than those from fission reactors, as well, with the materials remaining dangerous radioactive for hundreds rather than thousands of years. The system still works by generating heat and using that energy to move a turbine to generate electricity, which means Lockheed Martin could conceivably offer to replace existing fuel sources in powerplants using coal, oil, and nuclear fission with their fusion reactor with relative ease, too. And in an emergency, such as a large natural disaster, truck-mounted reactors could help restore power to entire cities quickly. Very rudimentary depictions of potential applications for Lockheed Martin’s CFR from the patent., USPTO Of course, it remains to be seen if Lockheed Martin’s fusion reactor will actually become a reality. Many other companies and institutions have tried for nearly a century to create workable fusion power without success. On the one hand, a corporation receiving a patent does not necessarily mean they are actively pursuing the technology that the document describes, either. In addition, since the media blitz in 2014, Skunk Works has said very little about this project outside of the plasma physics community. The U.S. government also reserves the right to classify patents it feels might be a threat to national security if they were public, so the fact that this one is not might also calls into question how mature the system might be in actuality. Still, the that Skunk Works continued to pursue the patent process over the past four years would similarly seem to indicate that they are indeed pushing ahead with the program, at least to some degree. This storied division definitely does have an impressive pedigree when it comes to advanced research and development projects, too. They were also confident enough four years ago to give interviews and offer significant details about the basic reactor design, the projected timeline, and the overall program goals, suggesting that it was a serious endeavor. Considering the five year timeline Dr. McGuire put out in 2014 for achieving a workable prototype, maybe we’re due for another big announcement from Lockheed Martin in the near future.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 22, 2019",Watch Iron Dome Accidentally Launch 11 Interceptors At Machine Gun Fire,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A quiet Sunday evening in southern Israel was interrupted by air raid sirens and the rapid firing of Tamir interceptors from local Iron Dome missile batteries. At first it was claimed that Hamas had launched a rocket barrage but it turns out that the Israeli Defense Forces claim Iron Dome was activated by machine gun fire—something it is definitely not supposed to do. IDF Spokesman Brigadier General Ronen Manelis told the Jerusalem Post the following after the supposed attack: “Everything is routine… All of the alarms were triggered by machine gun fire in Gaza.  There were no rockets which fell inside Israeli territory.” The miscue was a costly one. A rash of videos depicting the launches were posted on social media and it looks like at least three separate salvos of interceptors—each costing $50,000—took to the skies in rapid succession. One was of five missiles, followed by another of three more, and then another of four more interceptors, tracking towards a very low altitude target that we know now really didn’t exist. The IDF is investigating how the gunfire triggered the launches and the air raid sirens, but the ELM-2084 3D multi-mission radar used to provide detection and targeting for the interceptors is known to be highly sensitive. It’s capable of detecting and tracking anything from an aircraft all the way down to artillery rounds and even small mortars. With this in mind, a dense string of machine gun fire may have triggered the system and its operators erred on the safe side. Typically the Iron Dome system has a low misfire rate, although they have occurred, and won’t execute a launch if the projectile it is tracking is predicted to land in an unpopulated area. The IDF followed up their original statement, saying that the system was calibrated at a very sensitive level before the accidental launch and that the high-trajectory of the gunfire was identified by the system as a threat. General Zvika Haimovich told reporters on Monday the following: “The system identified a launch toward Israel, toward the community of Zikim, which acted like a ballistic missile in every way. It was a serious threat… There was neither a human nor technical error… There was system over-sensitivity, and we had five seconds to decide. The moment something is launched from the ground toward Israeli territory, we consider that a threat… We are operating in a very complex environment in which there are mortars, missiles, rockets, machine guns and heavy machine guns, some of which are standard and some of which are not… Today, there are rockets that are fired like artillery shells and there are mortars that behave like missiles. Our enemies are learning and developing.” It’s true that Hamas is actively trying to learn how to game the Iron Dome system, but the explanation still seems a bit odd, and it isn’t clear exactly what he meant when he said some of Hamas’s weapons are standard and some not. It’s possible that some other reason was at least partially to blame for the incident, although openly discussing it could give away vulnerabilities with the Iron Dome system. Regardless of what exactly set the system off in this case, the videos show just how insanely maneuverable the Tamir interceptor is. Some almost unbelievable snap turns can be seen as the missiles burn off their kinetic energy after their rocket motors burn out. Iron Dome launcher in Tel Aviv. , AP Each of Israel’s Iron Dome batteries consists of a radar system, a few launchers containing 20 Tamir interceptors each, and a battle management and control unit. The 200 pound interceptor carries a 24 pound warhead that is detonated via a radial laser proximity fuse. Range is highly dependent on the target’s flight profile but it’s listed as between roughly two and a half and 40 miles. It is widely noted that Iron Dome touts a success rate of 90 percent, but that number is based on projectiles it chooses to engage and usually at least two interceptors are fired at each target. Still, the system has proven to be remarkable in its capability and reliability which is what makes this incident so odd. In a bizarre coincidence, the misfiring of the Iron Dome battery in Israel occurred while Saudi Arabian Patriot missiles were attempting to intercept ballistic missiles fired from Yemen. Some of the Patriots malfunctioned spectacularly during that incident, resulting in even more dramatic video.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Apr 12, 2018","Lockheed’s MQ-25 Tanker Drone Looks Impressive, But It’s Still Just A Paper Plane","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Lockheed has unveiled its MQ-25 Stingray carrier-based unmanned aerial tanker concept, and it’s impressive—but it’s still just a concept. No prototype exists of the aircraft, and that could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on how the Navy actually evaluates the three proposed designs being offered before awarding a contract for four prototype aircraft late this Summer. Our friend James Drew over at Aviation Week got the scoop , and has conveyed both concept art and some interesting details about the Skunk Works’ Stingray design. Like Boeing’s and General Atomics’ MQ-25 contenders , but to a lesser degree, Lockheed’s MQ-25 appears to be influenced by the company’s Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) concept that came before it. That stealthy aircraft was dubbed the Sea Ghost and was a substantial outgrowth of the company’s proven RQ-170 Sentinel design , upscaled and refined for naval operations and the penetrating strike and reconnaissance mission. It’s possible, if not outright probable that a similar aircraft exists but in a non-navalized form in the classified world. Lockheed’s now defunct Sea Ghost UCLASS concept based on the RQ-170 Sentinel design., Lockheed Martin The Sea Ghost design was dropped after the Navy dumbed-down its carrier-based drone requirement to a tanker with limited surveillance capability—and one that didn’t have to penetrate into contested territory at all. As such, stealth requirements were jettisoned. The company seems to have decided that a flying wing design with a dorsal inlet was still the best answer for the carrier-borne tanker requirement. This makes plenty of sense as a flying wing can hold and efficiently transport a lot of gas. Drew writes that Skunk Works general manager Rob Weiss says that his team examined many different design concepts for the MQ-25 mission, but kept coming back to the flying-wing design for a number of reasons: “Weiss says a flying-wing concept was always in the mix, and it kept coming out on top. A flying-wing aircraft has the benefit of being aerodynamically efficient and can carry more fuel for its size. Other benefits include a lower total parts count and reduced spot factor on the carrier deck with the wingtips folded up. Despite the flying-wing design being shorter in length, the landing gear and tail hook have enough separation to safely catch the arresting gear, rather than trip over it.” Reducing the number of parts for an aircraft design is something the Skunk Works has been working tirelessly on for nearly two decades. The introduction of large-span composite structures and new kiln systems and manufacturing techniques has enhanced the feasibility of simplifying otherwise complex airframe designs dramatically. Experiments, both public ( X-55 ), and at the time private ( X-44 , P-175 ), have resulted in a mastery of these processes and the use of it in production aircraft like the RQ-170. The company actually locked its MQ-25 design less than a year ago, in mid-2017. So even though it borrows from prior Skunk Works work heavily, it is far closer to a clean-sheet design than a retooled variation of the Sea Ghost. And the differences between the two concepts are clearly evident. Lockheed Martin Lockheed’s Stingray has a far less defined ‘w’ trailing edge, with an overall thick wing chord, and it’s more portly all around—a function of having to hold at least 14,000lbs of gas to pass along after flying 500 miles, while still retaining enough fuel to return to the carrier. In fact, the design’s trailing-edge is as close to a delta shape as it is to a stealthier swept saw-tooth one, giving it a resemblance to the abortive A-12 Avenger from three decades ago and a very notable Nazi aircraft design . Instead of an angular and grated intake and a deeply buried engine like what’s found on the Sea Ghost, Lockheed’s MQ-25 has a simplified powerplant arrangement featuring a traditional elliptical intake with a relatively inline engine placement design. In other words, no ‘stealth’ in a place where it would matter most. A conformal satellite communications enclosure, almost certainly in the Ku bad, sits atop the aircraft’s inlet, and a pair of UHF satellite communication antennas are seen attached to both sides of the MQ-25’s rear upper fuselage, between its rear engine fairing. Other antennas are bolted directly onto the aircraft’s fuselage as well. It’s not clear if the aircraft will feature its own probe for aerial refueling from other aircraft or not. The aircraft will carry an electro-optical sensor turret for limited surveillance capabilities—a common feature for MQ-25 entrants—and a series of wide angle cameras in the aircraft’s nose will allow for control while operating on the carrier’s crowded deck. It’s not clear how much a human will have to do as part of this ground control concept or if hand gesture recognition is part of the system. Lockheed Martin Drew reports that company has used a surrogate aircraft for testing the MQ-25’s deck handling system. As we previously reported, our sources state that the now unmasked X-44A demonstrator’s last test mission was to validate the MQ-25’s remote deck movement control concept. What we don’t know is what command and control architecture the aircraft will operate on while on a mission, but it’s safe to assume it would be semi-autonomous in nature. In fact total autonomy for basic mission sequences seems likely as well, with the aircraft only calling home if there is an issue. Although somewhat shrouded in secrecy, Lockheed has made incredible strides in this area in recent years, including the development of synergistic cross-platform unmanned vehicle command and control interfaces. The aircraft’s ventral area is dominated by two side-by-side hard-points. One carries the Cobham refueling pod that is a mandated hardware requirement by the Navy. The other could potentially carry a podded surface search radar, but other radar pods, modular communications relay systems, or even an electronic surveillance or warfare pod could be added in the future as well. An auxiliary fuel tank is also possible. An exposed tailhook sits behind the hard-points below the MQ-25’s engine. It’s landing gear are clearly from the F-35C, which is no surprise as the Skunk Works’ has a long tradition of ‘borrowing’ existing components to lower-cost, shorten development time and alleviate risk. The F-35C is also worth mentioning as it has given Lockheed a load of recent experience when it comes to fielding a modern fixed-wing naval tactical aircraft. In addition, some of the F-35’s sub-systems and architecture could not only benefit the MQ-25’s feasibility, effectiveness, and its cost but also help simplify logistics and maintenance aboard the ship. Lockheed Martin While Boeing has a current and long-running pedigree with carrier-based aviation, General Atomics, which is putting a distant cousin of its Sea Avenger concept up for the MQ-25 prize doesn’t. The company does have more raw experience in the unmanned space than any contender. With this in mind, General Atomics has added Boeing to its team, which would work with its prior competitor should the company win the competition. What Lockheed has that its competitors don’t is the Skunk Works, which intends to support this program throughout its entire life cycle if the Navy awards Lockheed the contract. That means more than just a cool name and legendary track record. The ‘bleeding-edge’ business unit has specialized in developing, maintaining, and evolving small fleets of high-tech military aircraft for over 75 years. Considering the Navy intends to build just 72 MQ-25 production units, the MQ-25 enterprise could greatly benefit from the Skunk Works’ unique knowledge base of running similarly sized programs (U-2, SR-71, F-117, RQ-170) in the past. And clearly, adapting the MQ-25 airframe and packing on conformal radar arrays and electronic intelligence gathering equipment in exchange for some gas could be a relatively easy and logical development for the type and it could even lead to additional sales. Overall it seems that Lockheed has not only put forward a very intriguing concept but has worked to make it as affordable as possible, and has fully embraced the fact that this is a flying truck with no low-observable ambitions. In doing so the company has gone a long way to separate itself from the competition and especially from Boeing, whose MQ-25 prototype is a reworked UCLASS concept built in 2014, years before the tanking mission became the central focus of the Navy’s carrier-based unmanned aircraft ambitions. But at least Boeing actually has a prototype. While this all sounds great from Lockheed, their’s is a paper machine. As for trusting their ability to produce this aircraft on time and on budget with the capabilities stated, the company can point to work dating back the X-44A and onto RQ-170 when it comes to flying-wing experience and to their recent work with the F-35C for carrier-based tactical aircraft know-how. At the same time they will have a tougher time doing so for work that could be closely related in the classified realm. Supposedly General Atomics is rolling out their MQ-25 entrant within a matter of weeks, but even without it, they have been flying the Predator-C/Avenger , from which their design is supposedly based, for years. If, like Boeing, General Atomics does roll out an actual prototype, that could put Lockheed at a double disadvantage. There is no requirement to create a flying demo aircraft for this competition, but the first pre-production prototypes will need to be delivered by 2021. Lockheed clearly decided on the lowest risk, highest reward approach by not moving to construct one. It also allowed them to easily put forward a largely fresh, tailor-made design, which is attractive. But will their word, what looks like a great design, and a solid pitch, be enough to win over the Navy who has historically assumed far less risk when it comes to aircraft procurement than its USAF counterpart? I guess we’ll have to wait about six months to find out. At the same time it’s worth reflecting on Northrop Grumman’s decision to pull out of the contest. They had by far the most mature design in the X-47B. It had already spent hundreds of hours in flight testing and had even operated from a carrier on multiple occasions, not to mention refueling itself from a tanker. Like Lockheed’s MQ-25 it was also a flying wing with a similar configuration, although it was designed to be stealthy along the lines of the other defunct UCLASS competitors. Still, the company went as far as mounting a Cobham refueling pod on one of two X-47B airframes that were already paid for and tested. Couldn’t Northrop Grumman just have simplified and tweaked the X-47B’s design anywhere possible on paper to save on unit cost while using the existing X-47Bs as proof of concept demonstrators? It is somewhat hard to imagine that the Navy would buy a totally notional aircraft—or one that hasn’t even flown before—over one that is a derivative of an aircraft that has already been tested on a carrier. Regardless of Northrop Grumman’s possibly nearsighted move to step away from the MQ-25 tender, Lockheed has put forward some very impressive art. But the fact that they didn’t invest in a prototype is another sign that confidence in this program making it to production may be low. We have long posited that resistance to fielding advanced unmanned tactical aircraft is destructively palpable on a social level within the USAF and even the Navy. According to our sources close to the Navy’s pilot dominated aircraft procurement decision making apparatus, this program has little actual support. Additionally, at this point in time there are no funds to buy more than four MQ-25s over the next four years. So even if the four pre-production examples get built, they could end up becoming a tiny experimental testing fleet onto themselves unless additional funds actually materialize. If this proves to be true, building and presenting a paper airplane to the Navy instead of a far more expensive real one sure makes a lot of business sense.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",This Is What the US Air Force Wants You To Think Air Combat Will Look Like in 2030,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As part of a broader initiative to invigorate its advanced science and technology work and promote increased partnerships with academia, the U.S. Air Force has released a short video depicting how it thinks aerial warfare might look by the end of the next decade. It’s a futuristic, but in many ways incomplete vision full of advanced stealthy manned jets , semi-autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles , lasers and other directed energy weapons , and a potentially artificial intelligence-enabled network backbone that brings it all together. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), one of the service’s top research and development arms, put the clip online earlier in March 2018 as a “call to action” for the Air Force 2030 project. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson first announced this plan at the Air Force Association’s main annual convention and exhibition in 2017, which also marked the Air Force’s 70th year in existence. “We will listen broadly and engage those who are on the cutting edge of science so that we can focus our research efforts on the pathways that are vital to our future as a service,” she said in her keynote address on Sept. 18, 2017. “At a time when federal research funding may be uncertain we want the United States Air Force to be the sponsor of choice for research scientists.” But it’s clear that AFRL, and the Air Force as a whole, already has some understanding of the kind of capabilities it is most interested in pursuing. After giving a brief overview of the service’s already significant history of science and technology research and development work, the Air Force 2030 video cuts to a computer generated montage of advanced air warfare concepts. Loyal Wingmen The first scene depicts an F-35A Joint Strike Fighter working together with six stealth unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs. For years now, the Air Force, and AFRL in particular, has been working on this type of manned-unmanned teaming, which it has referred to as the “Loyal Wingman” concept . In 2015, Lockheed Martin, in cooperation with the CalSpan Corporation, demonstrated the ability of a two-seat Block 50 F-16D Viper to safely fly in formation with a modified unmanned F-16 test bed, known as the Variable stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft, or VISTA. At times during that test, known Have Raider , the drone Viper also broke off, followed a pre-determined route independently, and then re-entered formation with the manned aircraft. A screengrab from the Air Force 2030 video showing an F-35 and six “Loyal Wingmen” drones., USAF Two years later, during a follow on experiment called Have Raider II , the pair of aircraft actually went through the motions of a simulated strike mission. The pilotless F-16 attacked simulated targets on the ground autonomously based on an established set of parameters, but also modified its flight pattern in response to mock threats and other changing environmental conditions. AFRL has since released concept art of a more purpose built drone wingman under a project called Low Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT). That design looked very similar to the XQ-222 Valkyrie , a multi-purpose unmanned aircraft from drone maker Kratos that the U.S. Air Force also calls the XQ-58A. Kratos recently received approval to export its less advanced UTAP-22 Mako drone , which it has tested in a loyal wingman role in the past with a U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier , which suggests that there could be more advanced designs from that company or others in a relatively mature state already available to the Air Force. With some notable exceptions , the United States is typically not inclined to make military systems available even to allies that are directly equivalent to its own top-end capabilities. A slide from a 2017 AFRL presentation outlining the LCAAT effort., USAF Stealthy unmanned attackers The March 2018 video shows much more advanced loyal wingmen with completely tailless, low-observable planforms, internal weapons bays, and an in-flight refueling receptacle on top of the fuselage. Both the Air Force and the U.S. Navy have demonstrated the ability to refuel an unmanned aircraft in mid-air and the former service may have actually deployed drones with this capability. Coupled with mid-air refueling, such a force could potentially penetrate deep into denied enemy areas full of integrated air defenses and advanced hostile fighter aircraft to destroy critical or time sensitive targets. The group would also be able to strike at those defenses, helping open up a safer path for subsequent strikes by more vulnerable non-stealthy aircraft. In the video, the pilot in the F-35A uses the aircraft’s advance sensor suite to detect a surface-to-air missile site and orders some of his drone companions to attack it with what appears to be a GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) glide bomb. This combination of a manned low-observable plane directing stealthy UCAVs to hit a target with a stand-off weapon shows just how much distance a pilot might be able to put between themselves and a threat with this operating concept. Similar operating concepts could apply in air-to-air combat, as well, with the drones acting as missile trucks , engaging targets based on information from the controlling F-35 or another manned or unmanned asset loaded with sensors. It could also potentially help with the Air Force’s chronic pilot shortage by significantly expanding the capabilities a single manned aircraft can bring to bear across a broad area. A screengrab showing the profile of the more advanced Loyal Wingman aircraft concept from the Air Force 2030 video., USAF Netcentric warfare It only gets a brief and very narrow interlude in the video, but its important to note that these operations would almost certainly rely heavily on robust data links and other networked communication nodes, in the air, on the ground, and in space to rapidly relay information back and forth between manned and unmanned aircraft and other friendly forces. AFRL’s presentation shows how this might allow headquarters and air operations centers in the ground to monitor a pilots vital signs and life support systems specifically. This is a particularly important consideration given a growing number of reported cases of hypoxia-like symptoms among aviators across the U.S. military flying a variety of fixed-wing aircraft. Hypoxia refers to a dangerous drop in oxygen getting to the brain, or an outright stop in the flow altogether, which can cause disorientation, blackouts, and even death, and is particularly dangerous for pilots. The Air Force has had to deal with these issues with regards to a wide variety of aircraft, including the F-35 , the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter , the A-10 Warthog ground attack aircraft, and the T-6 Texan II turboprop trainer. Being able to keep an eye on these issues remotely could help prevent potentially deadly accidents. Some of the vital signs an air operations center might able to monitor remotely using data links., USAF Beyond that, though, networked systems will also give pilots and increasingly detailed picture of the battlefield during actual operations by fuzing together different types of data from various sources. Advanced artificial intelligence may be able to help parse that information, as well, speeding up a pilot’s decision making process by weeding out low-priority data and focusing on the most significant threats. In the video, the F-35 pilot appears to speak with a disembodied head, which could be a stand-in for an augmented reality communications system with other individuals or represent an artificial intelligence adviser of sorts explaining the situation at hand. There is the implication here that in the future a pilot may be able to issue commands to their networked wingmen using voice commands through this sort of interface, too. An F-35 pilot engages with a computer generated head on their heads up display in the Air Force 2030 video., USAF Drone swarms The AFRL video then moves on to a different drone concept, involving a canister-like module that dispenses dozens of small unmanned aircraft that work together as a swarm . The clip shows a humanoid robot pushing the entire system out the back of a C-130-type airlifter, after which a parachute deploys, suspending the system in midair, allowing the tiny planes to break off and go zipping along toward their targets. At present, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon’s top advanced research and development entity, is leading this work as part of a project it calls Gremlins . Still very much in the conceptual stage, the goal for the program is to develop a system that bombers or cargo aircraft, and possibly even fighter jets, can deploy, while a C-130-sized aircraft recovers the unmanned planes after the mission if necessary. A depiction of a parachute-retarded module deploying a drone swarm after falling from a C-130-type aircraft from the Air Force 2030 video., USAF As we at The War Zone have written about in depth many times before , these swarms have the potential to offer intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities over a broad area, as well as the ability to confuse or otherwise disrupt enemy defenses. Depending on their exact size and capabilities, they might also be able to function as munitions themselves or conduct non-kinetic attacks using electronic warfare jammers or other systems. With that in mind, AFRL itself is working separately on a project called Gray Wolf , which aims to develop a swarming, low-cost cruise missile type weapon. the Air Force hopes it may be able to leverage the same shell to carry different, non-kentic payloads eventually. A slide from a 2017 AFRL presentation describing the Gray Wolf program., USAF Microwave cruise missiles After all the drones, the video moves on to two depictions of advanced munitions and aircraft weapons. The first of these involves a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber launching a cruise missile that blacks out a city . Together with Boeing, AFRL has actually already demonstrated the first capability in tests of a weapon known as the Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project ( CHAMP ). This system used the body of an AGM-86 Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) to carry a still classified payload that uses microwave pulses to disable electronic devices. A “blackout missile” speeds toward a power plant in the Air Force 2030., USAF Since then, the Navy appears to have taken the lead on this project, which it refers to High-power Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike, or HIJENKS. The Air Force remains actively involved, though, and reportedly is responsible for the payload that will go into the prototype weapons. The exact shell for this new system is unclear, but there were reports in the past that the stealthy AGM-158B Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) could be the basis for the new weapon. This would make sense, as this system has a number of improved features over the older AGM-86s that make it harder for an enemy to detect and potentially shoot down. In turn, this could improve its ability to sneak into a denied area and neutralize an opponent’s key sensor networks and command and control nodes, blinding them to subsequent operations and throwing their response procedures into chaos. This gives such a weapon a powerful psychological, as well as function capability, as an enemy has no idea about the size and direction of what might be coming next. Depending on the specific platform carrying the system, it might not even be possible for them to initially determine the source of this non-kinetic strike, if at all. A slide from a 2017 AFRL presentation taking a look at the Navy-led HIJENKS program., USAF Laser-armed sixth generation fighters The video ends on a clip of a notional sixth generation fighter employing a laser weapon to shoot down an enemy aircraft. This combination is also something the Air Force has expressed an interest in and maybe closer to reality than some might think. AFRL is leading a project to develop an experimental podded solid-state laser weapon for fighter jets under the Self-protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator ( SHiELD ) program. The main goal there is to demonstrate a system that would be able to shoot down incoming missiles. A slide from a 2017 AFRL presentation regarding the SHiELD project., USAF But if this arrangement works, it could provide a starting place for an offensive directed energy weapon. Such a system could theoretically work in both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles and could offer a host of advantages over more traditional guns, missiles, and bombs. The inherent ability of a laser focus its beam narrowly on a particular point could improve overall accuracy and help limit collateral damage during air strikes, especially in constrained environments such as densely populated urban areas, which is itself an increasing topic of concern across the Pentagon. Depending on the exact nature of the power source, it could also offer an effectively “bottomless magazine,” allowing an aircraft to remain on station and armed for a protracted period of time, even after engaging multiple targets. A sixth generation fighter jet fires an offensive laser weapon in the Air Force 2030 video., USAF And though the video shows a tailless sixth generation stealth fighter shooting down another aircraft in a stereotypical dogfight, the Air Force is still in the process of outlining what it wants from this future aircraft. In its latest budget request for the 2019 fiscal year, which it released in February 2018, the service asked for more than $500 million to continue work on this Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform, which it has also referred to in the past as Penetrating Counter Air (PCA). This amount is nearly double what the Air Force asked for to support the NGAD program in the 2018 fiscal year. At present, there is little firm information about what this aircraft might look like beyond the service’s desire for it to be capable of flying for extended periods at supersonic speeds and be even more low-observable in order to avoid and defeat existing and emerging threats , have a long range to help give it more independence from increasingly vulnerable aerial refueling tankers , and just generally be able to operate persistently in denied areas. At present, the indication is that the goal is still have a piloted platform, but unmanned systems are increasingly the way of the future and the final design, however it evolves, may turn out to be at least pilot optional . “We believe you have to go fight the enemy in their airspace if you want to make air superiority work,” U.S. Air Force General Mike Holmes, head of the service’s Air Combat Command, said in 2017 . “Certainly we think we’re going to pursue counter-air, we’re going to pursue suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, we’re going to have to pursue an electronic warfare component of that.” A notional sixth generation fighter jet blasts a target with a laser weapon., Lockheed Martin A new air warfare paradigm It’s an aircraft that will fit into this otherwise potentially revolutionary concept of aerial warfare. At least one concept study has even pointedly attempted to avoid using a notional “F-X” nomenclature , suggesting that the Air Force believes the final design will be functionally distinct from previous fighter jets. An aircraft that flies together with loyal wingmen drones, engages with swarms of smaller unmanned aircraft or munitions, and carries advanced kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, could definitely fit that description. Like these other capabilities, the Air Force hopes that the NGAD will begin to enter service sometime in the 2030s. It’s an ambitious set of goal with an equally aggressive schedule, but the Air Force believes this is necessary in order to maintain its dominance over potential opponents, especially Russia and China . The U.S. military as a whole is increasingly sounding the alarm that those countries are pursuing their own increasingly advanced military projects that are closing the capability gap, directly or indirectly , between them and the United States. “China’s impressive military buildup could soon challenge the United States across almost every domain,” U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command told members of congress earlier in 2018. “We don’t have any defense that could deny the employment of such a [hypersonic] weapon against us” by Russia or China, U.S. Air Force General John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told legislators more recently in March 2018. Some in the Air Force might be hesitant to call its sixth generation fighter jet the “F-X,” but its clear that slipped into the Air Force 2030 video., USAF Finding the funds and resources to keep these research and development programs on pace while trying to sustain an increasingly complex force may pose serious challenges for the Air Force, though. The service is in the process of trying to ramp up F-35s , purchase new B-21 Raider stealth bombers , and just pay for the aircraft, personnel, and other assets it already has, which continues to be a struggle , among a host of other projects . It’s also worth noting that many of these and other critical assets are curiously absent from this video, including the B-21 , advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms , new aerial refueling tankers , fully autonomous UCAVs , and anything space related . That latter topic is already important will only continue to become more so in the near future for a host of different reasons . The need for more resources in general and the desire to potentially share those burdens more broadly among the reasons why AFRL and the Air Force are looking to increase their partnerships with academic institutions and private industry . This desire for more cooperative research and development in order to speed up the process overall was a significant theme in Secretary of the Air Force Wilson’s remarks in September 2017. “We want to use methods and organizational structures that best support university-based research so that we simultaneously benefit from the work that is done and develop the next generation of American engineers and scientists that we will need as a service to take us forward into the next frontier,” she said. This strategy “will define our highest research priorities to be sure, but it will also help us strengthen new relationships between our Air Force and the science community, our universities, and our industry partners.” And beyond just showing a potential future of air combat, AFRL’s video is, as noted, a call to action. If you think you have your own good idea, you can go to the Air Force 2030 website right now and let them know.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 28, 2018",Riyadh Just Came Under Ballistic Missile Attack Resulting In These Crazy Videos,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Saudi Arabia’s capital just came under ballistic missile attack, during which Patriot missile interceptors were launched to intercept. Although it looks like at least one Patriot hit one missile, a missile fragment, or even another missile itself, came careened into the ground, resulting in this amazing video: The trajectory of the projectile as it approaches the ground is a bit puzzling, it almost looks like it is turning while under control, but it could just be the result of the intercept. Then there is this amazing video of the Patriot missile launches, and it looks like one missile either intercepted an incoming missile at very low altitude or detonated shortly after launch either by command or due to a failure. Here is what appears to be at least a partially successful intercept: We still don’t know how many ballistic missiles were detected and engaged, or who fired them, but it was almost certainly Houthi rebels in western Yemen. The group has put Saudi Arabia under an increasing threat of missile barrage via ever more capable ballistic missiles that some claim are being provided at least in part by Iran. Saudi Arabia has ordered a highly elaborate missile shield from the United States in recent months to help defend their territory these types of attacks. Just three days ago an aircraft belonging to the Saudi-led coalition was shot down over Yemen by an improvised surface-to-air missile belonging to the rebel faction. We will update this post as more information comes available. UPDATE: 2:30pm PST— It looks like a Patriot went totally amiss. As we pointed out in the first video, the trajectory looked like a missile was being guided prior to impact. Once fragment from the engagement: UPDATE: 3:30pm PST— Yemen’s SABA News agency claims the missile fired at Riyadh was indeed a Burkan H2 belonging to Houthi rebels, the same type fired at Riyadh International Airport back in November . It’s the most advanced ballistic missile type associated with the separatist group. https://youtube.com/watch?v=6b5esH459o8 The attack may have been part of a larger barrage targeting multiple locales within The Kingdom. UPDATE: 6:50pm PST— A total of seven missiles were fired in a coordinates ballistic missile attack. Arab News citing a Saudi-led coalition spokesman: “Three of the missiles were fired toward Riyadh, two toward Jazan, and one each toward Khamis Mushayt and Najran.” One Egyptian worker was killed and two other people were injured as a result of the attacks. The Saudis claim they had intercepted all of the missiles. CNN states the following regarding targeting: “Houthi spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam said on his Twitter account that the rebels fired the Burqan 2H ballistic missile, targeting the prestigious Yamama Palace hotel in the Saudi capital.” Targeting of course is a relative term considering the quality of the ballistic missiles fired.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Strategic Command Boss’s Computer Screens Go Dark When Foreign Missile Is Launched,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that we at The War Zone take a heavy interest in America’s strategic command and control and continuity of government architecture, so whenever we get a new look into a particular aspect of that ecosystem we think it’s well worth sharing. CNN’s Barbara Starr seems to agree as she recently went inside Strategic Command’s “battle deck” command bunker at Offutt AFB —maybe the most likely spot in American where the end of the world as we know it would begin. You may be surprised by the fact that it looks more like a telecom company’s headquarters than something out of Dr. Strangelove, but don’t let its looks deceive you, the decisions made in this facility can result in mankind’s extinction. In the report we get some unique insights from Strategic Command’s head honcho and notorious straight shooter General John Hyten on what it’s like when a foreign missile launch is detected. Quite frankly it sounds like that episode from The Office where there is one app that instantly sends a single message to every peripheral and social media account you have. In Hyten’s case, the six monitors in his office go black, an alarm rings, subordinates message him and so on, prompting him to rush down to the command and control bunker to assess the situation. If need be he would quickly be on the phone with the National Command Authority, including the President and the Secretary of Defense, to order a counter-strike before an enemy attack arrived—a task that may need to occur in less time than it would take to watch an episode of Seinfeld without the commercials. During Starr’s visit to the Omaha base, a real-world launch was detected—almost certainly by the USAF’s space-based infrared early warning satellite constellation—with those missiles likely being of Russian origin and fired into Syria. As for Putin’s widely publicized push to develop and field new strategic weapons, such as hypersonic boosted glide vehicles and nuclear-powered cruise missiles , the general stated: “We have very good intelligence capabilities, and we watch very closely, so nothing he said surprised me.” Hyten, whose greatest fear is that the U.S. has forgotten how to go fast developmentally speaking, also shared those concerns with Starr, stating: “We have always been ahead of the world when it comes to those critical technologies, and we are today and everyone should know that… The question is 10 years from now will we still be ahead, and that’s what I am concerned about.” We even get to see the small safe that houses the same menu of launch options that the President has to work with in the nuclear football that follows him wherever he goes . But the general underlines that his business is all about deterrence, telling CNN: “If someone launches a nuclear weapon against us we launch one back… They launch another we launch another, they launch two and we launch two. You are on this escalation ladder that ends up nowhere. The key is to stop that behavior before it gets bad.” Make sure you watch CNN’s full report linked here . Another video that’s worth watching while we are on the subject of nuclear deterrence and the strategic apparatus that supports it is this one from PBS. It is similar to a recent 60 Minutes report , but it goes a bit further, taking you onboard a B-52H , inside a boomer and into a Minuteman III ICBM launch control station .

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Russia Halts Years of Work On Ballistic Missile To Pay For Hypersonic Weapons,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned it in a provocative speech , Russia has reportedly decided to shelve development of its RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic (ICBM) missile system and focus on fielding the nuclear-armed Avangard hypersonic boost glide vehicle using other designs. The decision suggests the Kremlin may feel the hypersonic weapon is more valuable than the missile carrying it, but also raises questions about whether the country has the necessary funds to support its broader strategic plans . On March 22, 2018, Russian state-run news outlet TASS reported that development of the RS-26 was no longer a feature of the state armament plan for 2018 to 2027. In an annual state of the union address on March 1, 2018, Putin said that the road-mobile Rubezh would be the primary launch vehicle for Avangard . The country had previously used the latter name to refer to the entire development program , including the intercontinental ballistic missile component. “The Avangard was included in the [state armament plan] program’s final version as more essential to ensure the country’s defense capability,” the source said, according to TASS. “All the work on the Rubezh and the Barguzin [rail-mobile ICBM] was put on hold until the end of 2027. A decision on the work’s resumption will be made after the current armament program is fulfilled.” Reportedly a smaller derivative on the RS-24 Yars ICBM , the RS-26 has been in development since before 2011. It is a controversial design that some have suggested could actually violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, commonly known as INF. Though Russia has insisted it is an ICBM, and has demonstrated that it can reach the appropriate range, experts believe this was only because the missile involved in the launch in question was carrying a light payload or no payload at all. The Russian Ministry of Defense released the video below earlier in March 2018 reportedly showing Avangard prototypes and a computer generated depiction of its operational concept. Subsequent tests have strongly indicated the missile can’t fly beyond intermediate ranges with an actual warhead, making it a design that the INF would prohibit Russia from fielding operationally. The United States accuses Russia of having already put a treaty-breaking ground-launched cruise missile, the SSC-8 , into service and the RS-26 appeared to be another means of skirting the agreement’s restrictions. Without the Rubezh, the primary launch vehicle for Avangard will likely be the still-in-development silo-launched RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, also known as the “Satan 2.” This missile is set to replace the older R-36M , also called the SS-18 Satan, by 2020. Some reports suggest it may be able to carry as many two dozen of the hypersonic boost glide vehicles, but this remains unconfirmed. The video below shows tests of the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM. However, separate TASS reports say that the hypersonic boost glide vehicle will be operational by 2019 and that it could enter service first aboard older UR-100N UTTKh IBCMs , also known as the SS-19 Stiletto. Russia reportedly acquired approximately 30 more of these Soviet-era weapons, in a deactivated state, from Ukraine in the early 2000s, and would refurbish and modify them in order to carry Avangard. Since these weapons remain in Russian service already, it would be relatively easy for the country to swap out the existing weapons with upgraded versions carrying hypersonic vehicles. Per the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) that Russia is party to with the United States, both countries can only have so many “launchers,” which includes land-based silos , mobile launch vehicles , or individual launch tubes on submarines , as well as nuclear-capable bombers . However, the deal sets higher limits on the total number of warheads either side can retain in total and places no restrictions on how many missiles without warheads a country can have in storage. This plan makes a lot of practical sense. As we at The War Zone have written in detail before , the benefit of a hypersonic boost glide vehicle is that it eliminates many of the existing vulnerabilities of traditional ICBMs, which follow largely predictable signatures and flight paths after launch. While existing U.S. space-based early warning sensors should be able to detect the launch of any one of the Russian ICBMs, especially from the thermal plume of the missile blasting off, they wouldn’t be able to monitor the subsequent flight of Avangard, which will reportedly be able to make rapid and frequent course changes at extremely high speeds. By the Pentagon’s own admission, the new component of the U.S. military’s ballistic missile shield wouldn’t be able to shoot down such a weapon, either. “Our defense is our deterrent capability,” U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, told members of Congress during a public hearing on March 21, 2018. “We don’t have any defense that could deny the employment of such a [hypersonic] weapon against us, so our response would be our deterrent force which would be the triad and the nuclear capabilities that we have to respond to such a threat.” In February 2018, Hyten detailed the need for faster development of new space-based sensors that would be able to pick up hypersonic threats, but that capability is still likely some years away. Russia, which routinely criticizes any and all American ballistic missile defense efforts, is undoubtedly aware of this, which helps explain the focus on Avangard. As it stands now, there is no realistic means of destroying a ballistic missile the Russians would launch from within their own territory during its vulnerable boost phase . Coupled with the sensor- and countermeasure-dodging capabilities of the hypersonic vehicle itself, the launch platform’s job is largely reduced to just getting that system to the right altitude and speed. The decision to abandon to the RS-26 in favor of putting Avangard on other platforms could also point to the hypersonic boost glide vehicle being further ahead in development than we might have previously understood. If that’s true, it’s also possible the Russians might also be inclined to look into retrofitting other existing ICBMs, such as the road mobile RT-2PM2 Topol-M and RS-24 Yars, with the new warhead. It’s worth noting, of course, that the U.S. ballistic missile defense shield as it exists today is in no way capable of defeating the Kremlin’s existing nuclear deterrent capabilities, either. This then brings up the possibility that the Russians simply can’t afford RS-26, whether they want it or not, along with the slew of other advanced strategic capabilities they claim to be pursuing. “It was initially planned to include both the Avangard and the Rubezh in the state armament plan,” the anonymous defense industry source told TASS. “It became clear later that funds would not suffice to finance both systems at a time.” There’s evidence that this may have been increasingly apparent for some time. Prior to Putin’s remarks in March 2018, there had been scant official mention of the RS-26 at all for years. The Kremlin was supposed to demonstrate the system to arms control inspectors from the United States first in 2015 and then in 2016, an event that still has not come to pass. Digging the old UR-100Ns out of storage can be seen as a cost saving measure as much as it is a way to potentially get Avangard into service faster, too. It’s an established design that Russia already knows how to operate and maintain. And despite Putin’s fiery remarks about the West having failed to contain his country, there are indications that international sanctions in response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014 and subsequent involvement in that country’s still-simmering civil conflict are having an impact . In March 2017, the Russian Federal Treasury announced deep cuts to defense spending, which subsequently forced the country to put a host of large-scale projects , including the Barguzin rail-mobile ICBM , on hold indefinitely. Earlier in March 2018, President Aide Andrei Belousov announced plans to trim billions of dollars more from upcoming defense budgets, though he claimed it was because of reduced demands from Russia’s armed forces. “This will be simply because we have passed the peak of saturating our defense forces with new types of armaments and military equipment,” he said. True or not, there are still serious questions about whether or not Russia will be able to sustain its myriad of strategic weapons programs in the future. At present, the country claims to be working on the RS-28 ICBM, Avangard, the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic nuclear missile, a fleet of upgraded Tu-160M2 long-range bombers , the Poseidon long-range nuclear torpedo , the Burevestnik nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed cruise missile , as well as upgrades to many of its existing designs, including the addition of advanced warheads . And while it might still be cheaper than an all-new missile, it could easily cost a significant amount of money to rehabilitate the UR-100N ICBMs and make them compatible with the hypersonic boost glide vehicle. There are reports that adding Avangard would make the missile substantially longer, too, which would necessitate the modification of the existing silos or the construction of new ones. Still, with all of these systems in various stages of development or production, it’s easy to see how the Kremlin could have decided it didn’t need the RS-26, too. But with the almost certainly high costs associated with this broad strategic armament program, the Russian government might not have had a choice when it came to deciding whether to keep working on this missile system, and it might be forced to curb its ambitions further into the future.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Early last February, The War Zone published an exclusive story detailing what amounts to a “missing link” in Lockheed’s flying-wing unmanned aircraft lineage, one that bridges the gap between the Skunk Works’ abortive RQ-3 Darkstar from the 1990s and the RQ-170 Sentinel that appeared a decade later in Afghanistan. You can read all about what we know and what we don’t about this previously highly classified experimental aircraft and why its existence is so important in our feature on the X-44A linked here. And now we are excited to announce that we have detailed images of the aircraft we described in our report to share with our readers. Below are photos taken by our great friend and prolific SoCal aerospace photojournalist Matt Hartman , proprietor of Shorealonefilms.com . The images were taken this morning at the site of the Los Angeles County Air Show that will be underway this weekend in Lancaster, California. The X-44A is being unveiled to the public there as part of the Skunk Works’ 75th anniversary. Considering it is the biggest public aerospace event in the same community where the famed ‘bleeding-edge’ aerospace engineering unit is based, it is a perfect setting to show off a previously unknown and seemingly very important Skunk Works test article.

The designation and even the use of the Indigo-Delta-Kilo (I Don’t Know) cryptic badge are as we previously reported, as it the fact that it uses a small Williams jet engine (Williams badge on the fuselage). The wings also appear removable and/or foldable, and the belly fairing seems to be able to be changed out to accept various payloads and gear designs. And its resemblance to the P175 Polecat demonstrator and the RQ-170 is striking. We are certain to hear more details about the clandestine life of this aircraft and how it got the seemingly contradictory title of X-44A soon as Lockheed is now showing it off to the public. But above all else, it allows us to fill in a blank that the author has long posited to have existed as part of the Lockheed’s flying-wing, penetrating drone lineage .

Eight months after the most deadly crash for the USMC in nearly a decade and half, the Navy and Marine Corps’ fleet of KC-130T tanker-transport aircraft remain grounded . As a result the Blue Angels have been without their beloved ‘Fat Albert’ airlift support plane, leaving a gaping hole in the team’s on-demand logistical needs and a favorite part of their air show act. Now it seems the Pentagon has sourced a replacement—from the Royal Air Force. The federal government’s contracting site FBO.gov posted a single-source contract announcement on March 23rd, 2018 for an urgent replacement transport aircraft for the Navy’s Flight Demonstration Team. The notice reads in part: “The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD), Whitehall, London, United Kingdom for the procurement of one (1) C-130J under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.” The Government requires a suitable replacement aircraft, which must be delivered in an expeditious manner, to avoid a gap in logistical support of the Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron. The aircraft being procured from the UK MOD has the requisite amount of life and technical capability to support the Blue Angels mission. Procurement of a comparable replacement C-130J from any source other than the UK MOD would create an unacceptable increase in program cost and delay in fielding this critical capability. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement.” Fat Albert over San Francisco Bay., USN The move is an interesting one on multiple levels. First off, NAVAIR decided it could not spare a single aircraft from its own KC-130J inventory, of which it has roughly 53 in service, nor could the USAF spare a C-130 airframe apparently either. On the other hand, apparently the Royal Air Force has C-130Js to spare, which stands in stark contrast to what was widely viewed as an airlift deficit over the last decade and a half, although clearly the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan helped with this issue considerably. A RAF C-130J blasts through Wales at low-level., Peng Chen/Wikicommons According to our friends over at Flightglobal.com , the RAF intends to operate their 14 C-130J-30 airframes that feature stretched fuselages through 2035, but their short-fuselage C-130J models, known as C-130J C5s, have been placed in storage: “In a controversial move, the UK government’s Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 proposed removing the RAF’s entire C-130J fleet from service. But with the service facing a looming tactical airlift shortfall and delays to the introduction of tactical capabilities for its incoming Airbus Defence & Space A400M Atlas, this decision was partially reversed in its 2015 review, which identified a need to retain 14 Hercules. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the RAF’s C4-model C-130Js as being aged between 17 and 21 years. Its short-fuselage C5-standard examples have already been retired from use or placed in storage. The UK acquired an original 25 “Super Hercules”, with one having been destroyed after sustaining damage from an improvised explosive device on landing at a remote airstrip in Iraq in 2007.” Paul Crouch/MoD Second, the acquisition of this aircraft will change Fat Albert’s routine dramatically. The possible transition to the J model has long been talked about, especially after the team used up its last JATO bottles which offered a spectacular opening to Fat Albert’s act. The C-130J would allow a near similar departure without the use of strap-on pyrotechnics and would also provide more dramatic maneuvers throughout Fat Albert’s routine. Above all else, it would mean a more reliable transport for the team which has a grueling schedule as the KC-130T force had suffered due to its old age and heavy use. The Blue Angels have recently gone entire seasons without their Fat Albert KC-130T as it required extensive depot maintenance, with a “gray” KC-130T being borrowed from a reserve squadron in its place. These borrowed fleet aircraft are usually referred to as “Ernie.” A much younger C-130 will help lessen the frequency and severity of Fat Albert absences. USN Third, the decision may be a ‘canary in the coal mine’ for the Navy’s geriatric and presently grounded KC-130T fleet. The aircraft already need over a hundred million dollars in upgrades to their propeller systems to get them flying again, and whether or not that money will materialize is yet to be seen. The summary of the 2018 omnibus spending bill has money for four additional KC-130Js but it doesn’t detail any funding for upgrading the KC-130T fleet. The 2019 budget has the upgrade on the Navy’s unfunded priorities list. Meanwhile NAVAIR will continue to suffer from the loss of nearly half of is organic airlift capacity and a large portion of its refueling capability. A pair of KC-130Ts seen in better days. They are some of the oldest C-130s in the Pentagon’s inventory. , Cpl Tatum Vayavananda/Wikicommons It’s also unclear how much this second-hand C-130J will cost NAVAIR, but if past surplus aircraft sales between the MoD and the Pentagon are any indication, it will probably be had at a very attractive price. The Blue Angels will likely be thrilled with this upgrade, and the fact that the aircraft will come from RAF stocks will make it all that much more interesting of a performer on the air show circuit.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A mob of protesters gathers outside an American embassy in a foreign country, chanting slogans and waving signs and banners, but militants eventually begin to infiltrate the crowd with weapons. Suddenly some of those individuals begin to hear strange, disembodied voices and see bright lights that come seemingly from nowhere, while others duck for cover from phantom machine gun fire or begin to feel a burning sensation. Eventually a voice begins to explain the situation to nearby civilians and advises them to disperse. This may sound like an odd cross between a near-future war movie and a horror flick, but it’s a very real concept the Pentagon’s central less-than-lethal weapon office, called the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ), is working on. This specific project , called Non-Lethal Laser Induced Plasma Effects (NL LIPE), aims to have a perfected a beam that can produce audible instructions and commands to an individual or a small group of people within three years and maybe have a practical prototype system ready in five years . “I’m trying to get a little plasma ball to speak to you,” David Law, head of the JNLWD’s technology division, told Military Times earlier in March 2018 at an exhibition focused on directed energy systems in Washington, D.C. “We’re this close to getting it to speak to us,” he added to Defense One on the sidelines of the same event. You can watch demonstrations of the experimental systems below. In the final experiment, which begins at 5:40 in the video’s runtime, you can eventually hear what sounds like a broken radio transmission. https://youtube.com/watch?v=0eJzcPz8ujo But it’s not actually transmitting a recording or relaying an actual person talking at all. What’s actually happening is an interaction between two lasers. The first is what’s known as a femtosecond laser , which shoots out pulses of amplified light at an extremely high speed. This creates a ball of plasma, a field of highly electrified gas with unique properties distinct from other states of matter – gasses, liquids, and solids. Those properties mean that U.S. military scientists can hit the field with a second small nanolaser to create different effects, such as light, sounds, and even the release of thermal energy. They say they’re working on developing ways to tune the system to produce specific audio wavelengths, which in turn will allow them to effectively artificially generate a human voice. It can also generate loud sounds – more than 140 decibels in some cases, the same as hearing a typical gunshot from 100 feet away – that could be distracting or painfully disorienting. A practical system could potentially replace a host of less-than-lethal systems American forces already have available to them. These include visible lasers that can temporarily blind or disorient individuals, so-called “ acoustic hailing devices ” that focus sound waves at long range to convey messages or pump out painfully loud noise, and microwave active denial system “ pain rays ” that can chase people away with an unbearable burning sensation. A plasma-based system could have added benefits in terms of range and safety over those existing devices, too. Theoretically, a practical device could hit a target with a less-than-lethal effect tens of miles away, exponentially greater than the aforementioned options. “Now I can put it anywhere. Range doesn’t make any difference,” Law told Military Times. “Range is a function of the optics. The bigger the mirrors, the farther the range,” he explained to Defense One. The arrangement also only creates an effect where the two lasers converge, meaning that there’s no broad range in between where the effects are the same. This, in turn, means that it’s less likely to inadvertently hit friendly troops or other bystanders situated between it and that actual target. These features might potentially open up the possibility of applying the same principles to other roles, as well, such as long-range, covert communication. The potential for lasers by themselves to transmit information across long distances is already well established and has been put into practice, especially in space-based applications . The video below offers a more detailed introduction into optical communications systems using lasers on satellites. A practical plasma system would also have definite potential as psychological warfare tool, especially if fitted to an unmanned aircraft that could potentially provide this capability discreetly or even in denied areas .  Both the U.S. military and the U.S. Intelligence Community would undoubtedly love to have the ability to direct disconcerting or false messages out of thin air at the enemy or even a particular individual, such as a terrorist leader. They might mistake the experience for some sort of divine intervention or a deteriorating mental condition. There’s some precedent for this within the U.S. military already, too. during the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force actually experimented with air-dropped “psychoacoustic weapons,” which were speaker boxes with recordings to either spew propaganda messages or terrifying or distracting noises. These “ Screeming Meemies ” never progressed beyond the prototype stage. The inner workings of the prototype air-dropped “Screeming Meemie” device. , USAF via FOIA Depending on how wide a range of effects scientists can create with the plasma, a similar system might be able to produce a potentially lethal or otherwise damaging effect at extended ranges, too. There are already laser-based defense systems for ground vehicles and aircraft that either destroy optics on sensor systems or blind the seekers on incoming missiles. The concept is still very much in the experimental phase, though, and there are significant issues that could make it difficult to employ it in real-world situations. Most importantly, the footage of the experiments shows that the device will still likely need a straight line between it and the target. When the scientists place an object in the lasers’ path it results in the light and sound pinging off its surface. The physical makeup of the target, including just its color, can also produce different results, which might lead to problems in devising a practical non-lethal weapon, as well. These kinds of variables are among the factors that have effectively prevented the U.S. military from employing its pain rays, even though American officials insist they’re perfectly safe.  Though it’s not clear how realistic a risk it actually is, there is definitely a concern that if someone were to turn the power too far on an active denial system, it might result in permanent injuries. Critics have similarly questioned whether or not long-range acoustic devices and dazzling lasers might actually have long term effects. The US military did briefly deployed an active denial system, such as the one seen in this picture, to Afghanistan, but never used it, possibly because of fears that an operator’s error could lead to serious injuries., USAF From both practical and public relations perspectives, being able to finely and precisely control the effects will be essential if the U.S. military wants to transition the system from a laboratory experiment into a realistic tool. Scientists and engineers will also have to build a complete system that is small enough to be readily deployable and rugged enough to survive real world conditions. The underlying science is sound, though, and it’s very possible that American troops might find themselves literally firing off balls of plasma full of warnings, instructions, among other effects, to protesters, other forces, or even enemy personnel sometime in the next decade.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on May 10, 2018",John Bolton As National Security Advisor Damages Prospects Of A North Korea Deal,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Trump just announced that his second National Security Advisor, Army three-star general H.R. McMaster, and the author of the administration’s guiding foreign policy strategy , has been canned. Taking his place will be John Bolton. Bringing in a guy that has been maybe the loudest voice when it comes to tossing away the Iran nuclear deal sure doesn’t help the chances of coming to a realistic agreement with North Korea on their own nuclear weapons program. McMaster was no dove, but John Bolton is the hawk of all hawks who has never met a war or military action he didn’t like. Right now, when we have to at least try and make Pyongyang think that a deal is a deal with the United States, putting this guy in as the President’s top national security aid is ludicrous and sends a terrible message. North Korea is already fully aware of how America treated Muammar Gaddafi after he gave up his nuclear ambitions, but putting John Bolton at the head of the National Security Council just when trust between two bitter foes is most needed is such a bone-headed move it would be laughable if it weren’t so dangerous. It’s also odd that Trump, who railed against the neo-conservative troop that brought us the war in Iraq and constantly told voters how stupid our past diplomats have been, would hire a major Bush administration retread like John Bolton. This is especially true considering that Bolton was a key proponent for the Iraq war during his time as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, the position he held in the Bush administration before taking up the role as Ambassador to the United Nations. Make sure to watch these three videos. Bolton talks about tearing up the Iran deal in the first video, how he sees a meeting with Kim Jong Un going in the second, and makes some head spinning comments about WMDs in the middle east that sound woefully familiar in the third. He even goes on to defend the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and other regime change dreams. It is a wild piece of footage that really underscores how volatile this man can be when given daily access to the President’s easily influenced ear. It’s near certain that Bolton’s constant presence on Fox News had something to do with his appointment by Trump as not only is the cable news network a major source of information for the President, but it’s also a primary recruiting ground for his administration—a tactic that has had laughably poor results . Now the biggest test will be seeing if Bolton can muzzle it when it comes to Iran until talks with North Korea have concluded one way or another. I would handicap the chances of him doing so at one in four, and that may be generous. This man will also be alongside the President at those critical negotiations, hardly a moderate voice when it comes to reaching an amicable compromise in leiu of starting what will undoubtedly be a massively bloody war that will shake world markets to their core. As for his super militant talk towards Iran, the United States needs a war in the Persian Gulf like it needs a hole in the head. With Mike Pompeo moving over from CIA Director to Secretary of State, the Trump foreign policy executive team is shaping up to be quite the Hawk’s nest. Considering what a very similar if not a more seasoned group of like-minded individuals got us into in the 2000s, it’s a frightening turn of events indeed.

Joseph Trevithick,"Updated on Jun 7, 2018",‘Marillyn Lockheed’ Tells President Trump The F-35 ‘Absolutely’ Is Invisible,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yet again, President Donald Trump has offered evidence that he may think Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is literally invisible . What’s worse, the firm’s top executive, Marillyn Hewson, agreed with his remarks and made no attempt to correct him at a time when her company finds itself in increasingly acrimonious negotiations with the U.S. military over the stealth fighter’s costs . The comments came after Trump signed a presidential memo on March 22, 2018, calling for tariffs and other trade measures against China, which could impact up to $60 billion worth of goods that country exports to the United States each year. Before, during, and since the 2016 presidential election, Trump has repeatedly criticized Chinese trade practices and theft of private intellectual property , which experts believe includes industrial espionage and scooping up data on sensitive military technology . Hewson was on hand for the signing and press conference afterwards, which prompted the president to introduce her – as “Marillyn Lockheed,” with particularly heavy stress on Lockheed – and make the comments about the F-35. Here’s a transcript of the exchange, which you can also watch below: Trump: “We buy billions and billions dollars worth of that beautiful F-35. It’s stealth, you cannot see it. Is that correct?” Hewson: “That’s correct Mr. President.” Trump: “Better be correct, right?” Hewson: “Absolutely.” Let’s be perfectly clear up front, the F-35’s low-observable design does not render it literally invisible to the naked eye. It is possible that Trump was referring to its reduced radar cross section and low-probability of intercept electronic emissions, but we at The War Zone have already documented a number of past cases that continue to indicate the president is talking about potential opponents being physically unable to see the aircraft under any conditions. In 2017, he told members of the U.S. Coast Guard, which is not expecting to receive any of the jets, the following : “With the Air Force we’re ordering a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is almost you know like an invisible fighter. I was asking the Air Force guys how good is this plane, and they said ‘well sir you can’t see it,’ I said yeah but in a fight, you know a fight, like I watch on the movies, the fight, they’re fighting, how good is it? ‘Well it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, even if it’s right next to it, it can’t see it.’ I said that helps, that’s a good thing.” Prior to that statement, the President gave a briefing in Puerto Rico concerning recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria, where strangely he told another Coast Guard representative following: “Amazing job, and amazing job. So amazing that we’re ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. Do you like the F-35? I said how does it do it in fights, and how do they do in fights with the F-35. He says we do very well, you can’t see it. Literally you can’t see. It’s hard to fight a plane you can’t see right? But that’s an expensive plane you can’t see. And as you probably heard we cut the price very substantially, something other administrations would never have done, that I can tell you.” These sorts of statements are both worrying and embarrassing, not least of which because they could easily send the wrong message to our allies , enemies , and the general public . It’s even more concerning given Trump’s propensity to make casual offhand threats of military action in public settings without any clear indication of how serious he might be or other useful context. If he is basing those kind of statements, and potentially policy decisions, on an inaccurate view of America’s actual military capabilities or other misreadings of events , he might unintentionally put the country in unnecessarily risky situations. It also hurts the United States’ credibility for other, more knowledgeable senior officials to have to later clarify or walk back these statements, which might also lead to dangerous confusion about what the actual facts are further down the line. Joint Strike Fighters, like this US Marine Corps F-35B, are quite visible to the naked eye., Lockheed Martin But even more galling is that it’s increasingly apparent that defense contractors and the U.S. military have become increasingly willing to try and manipulate Trump’s almost juvenile fascination and understanding of weapon systems as a negotiating tool. In front of the cameras at the White House, Lockheed Martin’s Hewson deferred entirely to the president. It’s not the first time she has done something similar, either. In February 2017, Lockheed Martin issued a statement crediting Trump with reducing the unit costs of all three F-35 variants, sentiments Hewson echoed herself the following month. “For him [Trump] to focus on the F-35 and to focus on how he can get the best price for the taxpayer going forward, I think, was perfectly appropriate,” she told reporters in March 2017. “He helped accelerate that [the low-rate initial production lot 10 contract] along, and I think he put a sharper focus on price and how we drive the price down.” Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, AP It is simply inaccurate to say that Trump was directly responsible for cutting the unit costs and saving hundreds of millions of dollars as he went on to claim. What it did do, though, was hand the president a victory and firmly turn him from an ardent opponent of the stealth fighter, who once said the program’s “cost is out of control ,” into an outspoken supporter of “that beautiful F-35.” We saw this again more recently when the White House claimed Trump had saved the American taxpayers nearly $1.5 billion in a deal with Boeing to purchase a pair of new, highly specialized presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force Ones. Trump had previously been highly critical of the project and claimed he had shaved at least $1 billion off the price tag. The Chicago-headquartered planemaker lauded the agreement, and the president’s participation, even though the basic math behind the claim just didn’t add up . An artist’s conception of the future Air Force Ones from Boeing., Boeing Hewson may now feel even less inclined to challenge the president given that her company is locked in unusually bitter talks with the Pentagon over the next F-35 contract, for low-rate initial production lot 11. The head of the U.S. military’s joint program office overseeing the program, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, has publicly said he believes Lockheed Martin isn’t negotiating entirely in good faith and that they are being unreasonably recalcitrant about discussing further reductions in the unit costs of all three Joint Strike Fighter variants. On top of that, Winter and other senior U.S. military officials have increasingly shared their frustrations with other elements of Lockheed Martin’s support of the aircraft, including on-going problems with the aircraft’s computer brain and associated cloud-based computer network , sharing of intellectual property information , and so-called “ quality escapes .” This latter term refers to aircraft that arrive with components or other features that don’t meet requirements and can require costly fixes. These issues can be as minor as contractors drilling holes too wide, but on a stealth aircraft any out-of-spec elements can completely throw off the aircraft’s low-observable qualities. As of March 2018, at least half of the deficiencies the U.S. military discovered with F-35s it had received had to do with stealth coatings or other features, according to Winter. All told, “the [F-35 unit] price is coming down, but it’s not coming down fast enough,” Winter explained to reporters back in February 2018. “I will tell you that I am not as satisfied with the collaboration and cooperation by Lockheed Martin.” Then Rear Admiral Mathias Winter speaks at a conference in 2016., USN When asked about whether he might decide to get Trump involved in the process somehow, the admiral reportedly said he didn’t think it would be necessary. Having seen how this process works in the past, and knowing a single one of Trump’s trademark Tweets can send ripples through a defense contractor’s stock price, it’s entirely possible the admiral could consider using the president as a cudgel if the negotiations continue to drag on. This is hardly a functional model for these kinds of negotiations. They also don’t inspire confidence that the actual requirements and demands of the U.S. military to respond to current and emerging threats and potential threats to the country will be the primary driving force behind any final decisions. As The War Zone’s Own Tyler Rogoway wrote in November 2017 : “His almost child-like view of tactical aircraft capabilities in particular is also a massive blessing for U.S. defense contractors who are in increasingly close orbit with the White House. Someone with this level of comprehension about complex weapon systems does not represent a good negotiator or strategist when it comes to procurement decisions and setting up America’s military capabilities mix. Instead they represent an easily persuadable mark with the power to make or break major defense deals worth billions of dollars. And those defense contractors are playing ball when it comes to feeding the President’s ego with great results to show for it.” Of course, one shouldn’t forget that Trump has done his fair share to foster this negotiating environment for major defense programs by insisting on personally and publicly injecting himself into a series of high-profile pet projects in the first place. That’s not necessarily to defend contracting processes across the government, especially within the U.S. military, which can be anything but functional in their own right. There is definitely a need for acquisition reform on a variety of levels within the Pentagon, but this method of engaging with defense contractors is part of the problem. It’s one issue that candidate and then president-elect Trump had himself suggested he would work to resolve , but something he unfortunately does not appear to have been able to put into practice. As to being able to see the F-35, we hope that someone will eventually make sure the president understands that the aircraft isn’t actually invisible.

Joseph Trevithick,"Posted on Sep 7, 2023",The UK Has Spent Nearly 15 Years Developing Watchkeeper Drones It Says Aren’t Safe to Fly,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After more than a decade of development, the U.K. Ministry of Defense has acknowledged that its Watchkeeper WK450 drones have yet to receive a full “release to service” certification. This means that officials have not yet deemed the aircraft safe enough to operate regularly in training exercises, let alone actual operations, and it’s not clear when they might be ready routine duties. On Jan. 29, 2018, Permanent Secretary Stephen Lovegrove, the U.K. Ministry of Defense’s chief civilian administrator, revealed the latest setbacks in a letter to the head of the Public Accounts Committee within the country’s parliament. The memo appeared online earlier in March 2018 and a report by Jane’s 360 called it an “unprecedented move” on the part of the Secretary. The United Kingdom first announced the project in 2005 and the British Army now has a fleet of approximately 52 of the unmanned aircraft, which carry a sensor turret with electro-optical and infrared full motion video cameras and synthetic aperture imaging radar with a ground moving target indicator function. “Any impact on value for money caused by the delay … has been mitigated by the ability of WK [Watchkeeper] to meet operational need in the intervening period,” Lovegrove insisted in his letter in defense of the project. “In relation to the balance between propriety and regularity, and value for money, existing controls, and their cost, are appropriate in relation to the potential for achieving value for money benefits.” “Watchkeeper has flown thousands of hours, supported British troops in Afghanistan and could be sent on operations now if required,” a Ministry of Defense Spokesperson told Jane’s, echoing those sentiments, in a statement earlier in March 2018. “The release to service safety certificate is expected later this year.” A British Army Watchkeeper WK450., Crown Copyright But these comments clearly downplay what otherwise appear to be serious issues that have plagued the program from the start. And though it is technically true that British Army, which operates the existing drones, could deploy them if necessary, they would need to secure an “Operational Emergency Clearance” waiver in order to do so. According to Lovegrove’s missive, the most recent delay was the result of the crash of one of the unmanned aircraft, with the serial number WK003, into Cardigan Bay off the coast of Wales in March 2017. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has not yet released the cause of that mishap, which occurred while a team of British Army and contractor personnel were training a new pilot. This incident, which was the second crash in as many months, grounded the entire Watchkeeper fleet until June 2017. The “subsequent development of relevant evidence” allowed flights to resume, but a under an experimental flight testing permit, Lovegrove explained. It is not entirely clear why the program has been so troublesome and the U.K. Ministry of Defense has been historically tight-lipped about the aircraft in general. The U.K.-based subsidiary of French defense contractor Thales and Elbit formed a joint venture company, UAV Tactical Systems, to build Watchkeeper in the United Kingdom. An underside view showing some of Watchkeeper’s sensors., Crown Copyright Watchkeeper at its core is a derivative of Israeli manufacturer Elbit Systems’ Hermes 450 , which first flew in 1998 and remains in military and civilian use around the world. Setbacks with the project even prompted the U.K. Ministry of Defense to lease nine of those drones from Elbit directly for combat operations. Part of the issue could be in Watchkeeper’s navigation system. The Hermes 450s that the British Army obtained from Elbit featured a unique inertial navigation system using laser gyroscopes, which may have carried over to the WK450. The earlier Hermes 450., Elbit Systems Those unmanned aircraft flew more than 86,000 hours during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but had also suffered eight crashes during flights in the latter country by 2013. Unfortunately, we don’t know the exact circumstances of those mishaps and whether some of the nine aircraft were involved in multiple incidents. Whatever the case, the issues appear to be long-standing at this point. In 2015, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that the British Army had only deployed three Watchkeepers to Afghanistan and only for a brief period of a few weeks before the United Kingdom withdrew the bulk of its forces from the country in 2014. The aircraft flew only 146 hours in total. This came as the Royal Air Force (RAF) successfully deployed its MQ-9 Reapers, which can also strike targets directly, to that country . Since then, the RAF has also employed those larger and more capable unmanned aircraft against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. There is no indication that Watchkeeper has participated in that conflict or returned to Afghanistan. It seems that the U.K. Ministry of Defense is determined to get some value for its money out of the Watchkeeper program. The United Kingdom has already spent more than $1.5 billion on the project. At the same time, the U.K. government has already had to cut defense spending and is considering trimming those budgets back even further as the country’s economy slows as it  moves ahead with its increasingly controversial decision to leave the European Union . As such, any further delays with Watchkeeper are only likely to require additional funds that are in increasingly short supply. Another of the British Army’s Watchkeepers., Crown Copyright On March 22, 2018, Stephen Lovegrove himself said the country’s military might have to give up a number of “ sacred cows ” in order to free up funds for more pressing priorities. He didn’t say what programs he had in mind, but the WK450s would seem like a good candidate for any cull, despite his remarks in the January 2018 letter. Doing so could leave the British Army with a glaring intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance gap. The time it might take to initiate a new program could leave the service without those capabilities for an even more protracted period of time or force it to consider another short term lease of suitable drones. Doing so could allow the service could turn to other more capable aircraft, such as the MQ-9 or a derivative of the U.S. Army’s MQ-1C Gray Eagle . The U.S. Air Force has also just retired its older fleet of MQ-1 Predators , another well established platform, and the United Kingdom could potentially look into purchasing some of those aircraft. RAF and US Air Force Reapers in Afghanistan., USAF The British Army could also look into more closely collaborating with the RAF in its drone operations. Since 1999, the two services have already worked together with the Royal Navy to run a single, U.K. military-wide Joint Helicopter Command , so there is some precedent for this kind of arrangement. Regardless, as it stands now, Watchkeeper isn’t providing the British Army with any real capability, either, and it remains uncertain when the bulk of the fleet will actually be ready for actual missions.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reports that Houthi rebels had turned seized Russian made air-to-air missiles into improvised surface-to-air missiles have been circulating for months.

Houthi rebels claim the aircraft targeted was a Saudi F-15S and that it shot it down, but we still don’t have any official confirmation of this being true, and considering how the Saudis have dealt with these incidents in the past, we may never receive such a report. A streaking fireball can be seen in the video which points to the aircraft at least being severely damaged in the engagement. https://youtube.com/watch?v=N7dUgR_4wBU In recent weeks the Saudi-led coalition posted aerial surveillance images of a Vympel R-27 turned SAM mounted on a truck. The image is troubling for coalition aircrews as the R-27 is a medium-range air-to-air weapon, and the P model, like the ones the Houthi rebels are putting to use, use passive infrared homing. F-15SA, RSAF This means that if the targeted aircraft isn’t equipped with missile launch detectors, and only the Saudi’s newest and most advanced F-15s are, the F-15SA , and the aircrew does not spot the missile as it ascends towards them, they would have no indication of an impending attack until it is too late. Saudi led coaltion The missile’s high speed also makes reaction time highly limited, as you can see in the video. In this case the missile’s incoming vector was from below and behind the jet on its left side, meaning it was likely not seen nor detected before it detonated very near the targeted aircraft. There is also intelligence that shows short-range R-73 air-to-air missiles have also been adapted into SAMs. Employing one of these weapons would be more challenging due to its more limited range, which is exacerbated by the fact that it is launched from the ground and without a booster, making what is already a limited-range air-to-air missile much more limited in terms of reach. Saudi led coalition Many to believe that Iran is actively helping with the Houthi’s missile conversion initiative, which makes perfect sense as they have helped with supplying or adapting other advanced weapons for the Houthis to use in the past. These have including everything from anti-ship missiles and explosive-packed drone boats , to ballistic missiles , to ‘suicidal drones that target air defense systems. At the same time, some analysts think these conversions could be done by ex-Yemeni Air Force engineers who are familiar with the servicing the missiles. As for where the missiles came from themselves, they were looted from air bases in the western part of country as the Yemeni civil war kicked off. Yemen’s now largely shattered air force flew dozens of fairly advanced MiG-29SMTs, the first of which were delivered in the mid 2000s. The primary air-to-air armament for those multi-role jets were R-73E and R-27T missiles. It’s unknown how many of these missiles have survived three years of incredibly bloody conflict, but clearly some of them have. And considering they didn’t have to be smuggled into the country, they offer Houthi fighters and possibly the powers that be in Tehran an attractive anti-air resource in which to badger coalition fighter aircraft. If the events of the last few months are any indication, we haven’t seen the last of these jury-rigged Houthi SAMs. Contact the author: Tyler@thedrive.com Tyler Rogoway Editor-in-Chief Tyler’s passion is the study of military technology, strategy, and foreign policy and he has fostered a dominant voice on those topics in the defense media space.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",AC-130 Gunship Mysteriously Flew Hours Worth Of Laps Over Seattle on Tuesday (Updated),"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. An AC-130 gunship, the most feared asset in the Pentagon’s special operations aircraft inventory, flew a highly peculiar path around south Seattle on Tuesday afternoon. The highly modified C-130J transport plane , which bristles with 30mm and 105mm cannons , advanced sensors and defensive countermeasures, and can carry a variety of missiles and guided bombs, wasn’t ‘squawking’ its callsign and wouldn’t even have been noticed if it weren’t for keen-eyed aircraft trackers who monitor plane movements via their ADS-B transponders, which provide basic geographical location, altitude, speed, and flight registry. The AC-130J Ghostrider gunship—the newest AC-130 variant that was just declared operational late last year by Air Force Special Operations Command—flew all the way from its home at Hurlburt Field located on the Florida Pan Handle to Seattle with a possible stop for fuel in Grand Junction, Colorado under the callsign SHADOW99. USAF Once on station, the gunship began flying a series of tight racetrack patterns with the majority of them passing over Seattle International Airport and extending out as far as Renton to the east and Vashon Island to the west, with one track going as far north as the upper reaches of Lake Washington. The AC-130’s route over Seattle., ADS-B Exchange Screencaps We don’t know for sure what the AC-130 was doing flying these patters at roughly 8,500 feet over such a dense area—both in terms of population and air traffic—but the event is eerily reminiscent of another series of flights that occurred last summer. The War Zone broke that story as well , but the aircraft in question then was a shadowy CN-235 special operations transport plane that was highly modified for surveillance and intelligence gathering. It flew very well defined surveillance patterns over a number of weeks in the same area as where the AC-130 was flying on Tuesday. The specially outfitted CN-235 is used to find and fix terrorist targets overseas using its suite of electro-optical and signals intelligence gathering sensors, and to directly support special operators on the ground. The AC-130J is also outfitted with an elaborate surveillance suite, but it’s primarily used is to provide overwatch and targeting for the aircraft’s diverse weapons inventory, including its two cannons. Primarily the Ghostrider leverages a pair of powerful MX-20D electro-optical/infrared turrets located under its nose and on an expanded landing gear sponson on its port side for these duties. Having two turrets allows for the AC-130 crew to quickly build-up their situational awareness over a target area, and to maintain surveillance while simultaneously engaging targets on the ground with pinpoint accuracy. It’s possible that these new aircraft could also be equipped with some communications intelligence gathering and emissions geolocating capabilities as well to help it hunt for targets on the battlefield. Gunners on the AC-130J “Angry Annie” operate the 105mm cannon during that aircraft’s first live-fire test in January 2017., USAF What’s most interesting about the Ghostrider’s jagged flightpath over Seattle is that in most cases the aircraft flew directly within the perimeter of Seattle International Airport. It’s possible that the AC-130J was practicing locating targets at the airport and along its extended flight paths. As we mentioned in our earlier piece on the CN-235’s mysterious flight patterns, the area presents a unique mix of diversified terrain, complex roadways and urban sprawl, as well as port facilities and large bodies of water that are frequently trafficked by vessels. This would be a very “target rich” but also challenging environment for AC-130 crews to train above. The Pentagon, and especially Special Operations Command, have made it abundantly clear that future wars are likely to be fought in so called “mega cities.” The AC-130 in particular would be extremely useful in such a fight as it can deliver high-volumes of fire with better precision than nearly any other platform in the inventory, and it can stay on station and provide overwatch for a long time without the need to refuel. It’s worth noting that Special Operations Command is known to conduct training operations in urban areas , sometimes with little or no notice, which has drawn significant ire from local populations. USAF The track does not make it clear exactly where the aircraft landed, but it is likely sortieing out of McChord AFB located near Tacoma to the south of where it was flying its patterns. Apparently the aircraft landed, took on fuel, and then launched again and was up flying similar patterns last evening, although we don’t have a recorded track on that flight. We have done a cursory examination of the radio traffic emanating from Seattle International Airport at the time the AC-130 was overhead and strangely enough, we couldn’t pick up any direct communications or traffic calls. It’s possible both air traffic control and the AC-130 was communicating on UHF, which wouldn’t be recorded by LiveATC.com. We have reached out to Air Force Special Operations Command for explanation but they were unwilling to “comment on the movement of our assets” at this time. We will be sure to keep you in the know if the mysterious Ghostrider gunship pops up again over Seattle. Update: 1:30am PST— Here is another track from the AC-130J’s latest mission, flown on March 21st, 2017. The aircraft executed the mission under the callsign EXIDS11. The jagged lines are likely the result of imperfect telemetry garnered from Multilateration (MLAT) tracking according to two separate sources. The MC-130J’s route continues to be focused on Seatac and is very similar to the one flown the day earlier. The length of these legs is also consistent with an AC-130’s overhead surveillance profile according to multiple sources that have contacted The War Zone. ADS-B ADS-B Other sources have also mentioned that a larger special operations exercise may begin in the coming week, with multiple aircraft flying out of McChord AFB. We will keep an eye out to see if the MC-130J in question is joined by some of its special operations stablemates in the skies over Seattle.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jun 29, 2018",The Best Of The USMC’s Aging F/A-18 Hornets To Receive Lethal Radar Upgrade,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. With a new Navy plan to retire nearly half its F/A-18A/B/C/D fleet in the near term to help boost the readiness of its youngest so called “legacy Hornets,” which the USMC will inherit in the not so distant future, the Corps is now moving to upgrade seven squadrons worth of jets with new active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. The move signifies the most substantial capability upgrade in the legacy Hornet’s entire history. In a posting on the government’s contracting site FBO.gov it states that the USMC is looking to install the systems “in 4th Quarter 2020 and complete in 4th Quarter 2022, for fielding of a total of 98 systems (7 fleet squadrons retrofitted with 14 replacement radars each.” These 98 Hornets stand to be the most capable of their kind once upgraded as an AESA array gives a fighter a slew of enhanced abilities. These include drastically enhanced detection and tracking ranges, target discrimination and identification, the ability to spot low-flying reduced radar cross-section targets like cruise missiles, as well as the capability to rapidly scan huge volumes of airspace as AESA radars do not rely on a mechanically steered radar dish to do so. APG-73, Raytheon AESA radars and their powerful backend processing abilities can also “interweave” air-to-air and air-to-ground radar modes simultaneously, drastically increasing a fighter pilot’s situational awareness and defensive capabilities. Even electronic attack and long-range communications are secondary capabilities of an AESA array, the former of which could be intrinsic to the jet’s battlefield survivability in the years to come. But maybe most important is that AESA’s are far more reliable than their mechanical scanning counterparts. And the supportability of the existing AN/APG-73 radars is becoming a big concern for the USMC. The contracting notice reads: “The AN/APG-73 is installed on F/A-18 C/D aircraft. The APG-73 has been subject to ongoing maintainability, supportability, and readiness issues. To alleviate these issues, the USMC is pursuing a replacement to the APG-73. Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) solutions are required due to the increased reliability and sustainability requirements as well as the associated capability improvements.” The F/A-18A Hornet was originally fitted with an AN/APG-65 radar, which is lighter and less capable, especially in air-to-ground modes, than its successor, the AN/APG-73 which appeared during the F/A-18C’s production run. The earliest F/A-18E/F Super Hornets were built with the AN/APG-73 as well, but Raytheon’s AN/APG-79 AESA radar system quickly became a prime feature of the Super Hornet and Growler, and the radar sets were back-fitted to earlier Super Hornet jets. USN The USAF has followed a similar upgrade path as of late as what the USMC is proposing. The F-22 Raptor was the first to field and AESA array in the form of the AN/APG-77. Today a large portion of the F-15C/D fleet has been upgraded with the highly powerful AN/APG-63V3 radar system. The F-15E is also getting a very similar radar from Raytheon, albeit one optimized for multi-role missions, called the AN/APG-82 . Some of the USAF’s F-16C/Ds are set receive an AESA arrays as well in the form of the modular AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) built by Northrop Grumman. Raytheon also has a similar modular radar design called the AN/APG-84 Raytheon Advanced Combat Radar (RACR). These two radars are likely to compete directly for the USMC’s Hornet upgrade initiative just as they did for the F-16’s upgrade program, albeit that was an internal Lockheed decision. But Raytheon appears to have an advantage in this case as they are the sole supplier of radars to the Navy’s Super Hornet fleet and they have even demonstrated how easily their RACR AESA array can be fitted on an F/A-18C (see video below). https://youtube.com/watch?v=zB-Sb8849Y0 The contract announcement also has terminology that seems to give Raytheon a massive leg up over the competition: “Requirements include expertise in the design and integration of AESA radar systems, specifically on F/A-18 C/D platforms to ensure size, weight, power, and cooling requirements are met with no change to the established aircraft interfaces. Familiarity with F/A-18 C/D mission computer interfaces will be required to meet the retrofit schedule stated above… Hardware commonality with existing USN and/or USMC radar programs of record is required in order to reduce support and sustainment costs.” Other possible candidates do potentially exist, including Israel’s Elta 2052, Sweden’s Selex’s unique ES-05 Raven , and other adaptations of existing foreign fighter AESA arrays like Euroradar’s CAPTOR-E, albeit these companies would have to pair with a domestic contractor to compete. Regardless of who wins, the 98 jets that get this upgrade will become far more formidable and will likely become the last front-line legacy Hornets in the Pentagon’s inventory in the decade to come. The radar upgrade could also attract interest from other Hornet operators who may look to prolong the life of their fleets instead of buying replacement aircraft. Finland, Switzerland, Spain, Australia and Canada also fly the legacy Hornet. Canada in particular may jump on the concept if the USMC moves forward as they look at stretching their Hornet fleet’s lifespan to the max as a result of continued delays in procuring a new fighter aircraft. An AESA upgrade would also make full use of the AIM-120D AMRAAM missiles they have been cleared to purchase. Royal Canadian Air Force The upgrade could also be packaged with a structural life extension and other upgrades, such as a new digital electronic warfare suite and cockpit displays, for air arms looking for bargain 4.5 generation fighter capability on the second-hand market. If anything else, further radar upgrades to more legacy Hornets in the USMC’s and Navy’s stable could provide a far more capable adversary support aircraft for aggressor squadrons. Currently both VFC-12 and VFA-204, as well as the Naval Air Warfare Development Center, fly legacy Hornets as aggressors and what aircraft will replace them has become an increasingly pressing issue both in the Navy and Congress. VFA-204 jet blasting out of PDX., Tyler Rogoway/Author Regardless of if the program leads to additional upgrade prospects or not, it’s good to see the USMC investing into its largely neglected legacy Hornet fleet, and it will be exciting to see this final, ultimate F/A-18C configuration as the type enters into the twilight of its nearly four decades long career.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 3, 2018",U.S. Army Forges Ahead With Its Railgun As Navy’s Commitment To The Tech Is Questioned,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There have been largely unfounded claims that the Navy is ‘abandoning’ what was once its most high-profile future weapons technology, the electromagnetic railgun. But even though the Navy’s railgun program continues, it still exists largely in a primordial research and development state. Meanwhile China shocked the world by moving forward with fielding its own prototype railgun for shipboard testing . But the U.S. Army, with the help of the Pentagon’s Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium (DOTC), is quietly aiming to move General Atomics’ scalable “Blizter” railgun concept into a semi-operational state. For those who don’t know what a railgun is, the Army best describes the technology as such: “Railguns use two parallel metallic rails with a sliding armature between them that holds the projectile. When a large electromagnetic pulse is introduced to the rails, a powerful magnetic field is created that propels the armature and projectile along the rails at hypervelocity. Velocity depends upon the power of the pulse. Railgun projectiles are non-explosive and safer to manufacture, transport and store. Velocity is adjustable shot-to-shot, conserving power. Projectiles are guided to the target after leaving the launcher, and reach a target faster. At 100 yards, railguns sound no louder than a .30-06 rifle firing. What little “smoke” they create is actually plasma particulates or dust.” Earlier this month, General Atomics—the same folks who produce the Predator and Reaper drones, as well as the Navy’s less than ready for prime time Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), among many other defense products—announced that it had been awarded a contract to further develop and test their railgun for U.S. Army applications. The contract will run for three years and will result in a number of prototypes that will be evaluated and integrated into existing Army vehicles and fighting doctrine. General Atomics Nick Bucci, vice president of Missile Defense and Space Systems at General Atomics stated the following in a company release: “This contract allows the ARDEC to leverage our on-going research, development, and testing to advance railgun technologies and further develop railgun weapon systems for Army applications enhancing their effectiveness against multiple types of threats… The railgun weapon system is intended to integrate with existing Army systems and complement conventional capabilities, providing an effective counter to aircraft, rocket and cruise missile raids as well as other threats.” Mike Rucker, the director of programs for Missile Defense Systems also added: “Using hypersonic projectiles, railgun provides the soldier with shorter time to target, achieves effectiveness at longer range, and provides a lower cost per engagement than conventional interceptors.” General Atomics We have detailed all of these potential benefits of railguns in the past but usually in terms of how the Navy could employ such a system, not a land-centric force like the United States Army. But in actuality, the Army has just as much if not a greater need for railgun technology. If anything else, it would give the service’s artillery units the ability to rapidly deliver extremely hard-hitting attacks over double the range of existing multiple-launch guided rockets systems—namely the M30 and M31 guided rockets used by HIMARS . It would also have much deeper magazine depth and the ability to provide more persistent fire support. And it would be able to do all this economically and in any weather conditions. Being able to draw an 80 to 100 mile radius around a point on a map and know you can quickly engage targets at any time and in any atmospheric conditions within that circle without relying on air power is a very attractive capability to have in itself. But executing artillery strikes is just one of the railgun’s many applications. As noted by Mr. Bucci, the technology is nearly an ideal anti-air weapon—potentially capable of taking out air breathing and ballistic missile threats. Even counter-motor, artillery, and rocket defense could be another critical job for these weapons. A land-mobile railgun concept., General Atomics So for the Army, which will face the possibility of operating deep in contested territory, potentially without persistent air cover, the railgun concept is something of a super weapon. With this in mind, General Atomics wants to take what they have learned from their three mega joule and 32 mega joule test guns and refine the technology into a 10 mega joule land-mobile railgun system. The company has supposedly made some major advances in miniaturizing the infrastructure needed for generating and distributing the pulsed power required to launch guided projectiles at hypersonic speeds via their railgun architecture. General Atomics Nick Bucci told the Army the following during testing last Summer at Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah: “We’re getting more energy in a smaller package, so you can have more energy and still have (the railgun) be transportable… We’ve made tremendous strides on the energy density of capacitors.” One of the biggest roadblocks in operational railgun development has been longevity of the barrels used to propel projectiles at nearly 6,500 miles per hour—twice that of a standard artillery round. But Bucci notes that this too is changing: “The way we produce the launchers now, we believe bore life will be in the neighborhood of thousands of shots” An amazing shot of a hyper-velocity projectile separates from its sabot casing after leaving the railgun’s barrel., General Atomics Meanwhile, China’s military has confirmed that it has indeed fielded their railgun prototype aboard a ship for testing. Global Times quoted the official Chinese release as such: “On Thursday, navy.81.cn published a report about Zhang Xiao, an associate research fellow at the PLA Naval University of Engineering. The report mentioned that Zhang is a key figure in China’s research into “electromagnetic launching technology,” and she is also a core member of the team led by Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ma’s team is responsible for research into the most significant areas for the Chinese navy, including nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, and Zhang has also made her own contributions to the navy. “After hundreds of failures and more than 50,000 tests,” Zhang has successfully developed the largest “repeating power supply system” in the world, the report said.” China’s railgun prototype mounted on an amphibious transport vessel for testing., Chinese Internet The idea that the Pentagon would abandon electromagnetic railgun technology during a new age that the Pentagon itself describes as one marked by ‘great power competition’ was and still is a laughable claim. And now it’s clear that the Army putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to making its own railgun dreams a reality in the not so distant future. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oZW6s8C1vqA We will have to wait and see if the Navy’s program, which also includes BAE Systems’ railgun design, gets accelerated through reprogrammed funding. Just two years ago the seagoing service was dead-set on a shipboard test of the technology around right now. In fact, some of the Navy’s brass was contemplating skipping that test altogether and installing the system on an operational ship—a ludicrous idea but one that was being floated nonetheless. Although those fevered railgun dreams have been severely tempered, if General Atomics can prove its technological breakthroughs in a proof of concept format over the next few years for the Army, maybe the Navy will migrate towards the program as well. It wouldn’t be the first time the Army has given birth to a high-tech capability that other services quickly appropriate as their own .

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 6, 2018",The United States Could Offer Taiwan Leased F-15C Eagles According To Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s no secret that Taiwan wants the F-35, and especially the F-35B with its ability to operate from dispersed locales that normal fixed-wing fighters cannot. During the Obama administration, even allowing Taiwan to purchase late-block F-16s was deemed unacceptable under a highly controversial policy. Instead the country had to upgrade its old F-16As to a similar configuration. Although the Trump administration is rewriting the book when it comes to Taiwan-U.S. relations, F-35s are still seemingly off the table, but leased second-hand F-15C Eagles may not be. It has been abundantly clear from early on that despite trying to woo the favor of China’s President Xi Jinping, along with his help with the North Korea standoff, the Trump administration has no plans on sticking to established norms as to how it deals with Taiwan. Just this week Trump signed a travel bill that encourages direct visits to Taiwan by U.S. officials, which infuriated China, who subsequently warned against deepening military ties between Taipei and the United States. Part of this changing relationship will likely involve the U.S. offering up more advanced weaponry to Taiwan than in the past. Taiwanese news outlet Up Media was first to report on the potential offering, describing it as a compromise solution between exporting a new fighter to Taiwan, like an advanced Strike Eagle derivative, or even the F-35, and denying Taiwan any additional upgrades in tactical air power fleet. The piece describes what sounds like ex-USAF F-15C/Ds that would be acquired under a lease arrangement with tight restrictions over how the aircraft would be employed and what modifications would be made to it. Tyler Rogoway/Author The report notes that the Eagle is especially well-suited for intercept operations and can operate from shorter fields, not to mention its large missile load and plentiful range. Taiwan isn’t only facing an ever increasing threat from advanced Chinese air power , but that threat is emanating from an expanding geographic area. China can now approach from the country’s east via Beijing’s carrier-based fighters . Long-range bomber patrols around the island, which are still something of a new concept , have increased substantially as well, turning Taipei’s strategic gaze in multiple directions. Currently the Republic of China Air Force flies a mix of F-16A/Bs, Mirage 2000s, F-5s, and F-CK-1 lighter-weight indigenous fighters—none of which possess the range, magazine depth, radar reach, or raw kinematic performance as the F-15. F-CK-1, Toshiro Aoki/wikicommons As for how such a deal would be executed logistically, the question is where would the F-15s come from? There are roughly 100 F-15Cs and a small handful of F-15Ds currently in storage at the Pentagon’s aircraft boneyard in Tucson, Arizona. The majority of these aircraft are beyond their service lives and would require structural enhancements or some sort of intensive inspection regime to keep them in the air reliably. But under a lease deal, giving the jets some structural upgrades could be factored into the price. Other upgrades could be installed at that time as well, although it isn’t clear if the State Department would clear the installation of APG-63V3 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars onto the jets. That radar set is widely regarded as the most powerful fighter-borne AESA array in the world. The country’s F-16A/Bs will also be getting a smaller but still highly capable AESA array during their upgrade process. If the Taiwan’s notional Eagles had upgraded radars as well it would go a long way when it comes to balancing the playing field between Taiwan and China, at least qualitatively, and would be especially useful for detecting and engaging low-flying cruise missiles which are a massive threat to Taiwan. F-15C with APG-63v3 installed., Tyler Rogoway/Author On the other hand, the F-15C/D’s future within the ranks of the USAF is not fully assured. Last year there was considerable thought put into retiring the USAF’s fleet of around 200 F-15C/Ds and replacing them with upgraded F-16s. That controversial initiative was put to bed for the time being, but it seems somewhat clear that the USAF would have to invest big money to re-winging some or all of the fleet beginning in the late 2020s. Other structural enhancements, like replacing the jet’s infamous longerons around its cockpit section, would have to occur sooner. Then just last week it was reported that the F-15C/D’s much anticipated electronic warfare upgrade—the backbone of a new set of survivability and lethality enhancing features—has been cancelled. We can’t stress enough how much of a red flag this move is for air superiority Eagle community’s long-term viability. With this in mind, if the USAF does retire the fleet in the coming years, some of these jets, many of which have the new radar, could be sent to Taiwan. The possibility of selling F-15s to Taiwan surfaced before in a Lockheed Martin briefing to U.S. Pacific Command on enhancing the country’s F-16 fleet that was obtained via FOIA. It makes it bluntly clear, at least in their opinion, that Boeing wouldn’t dare sell Eagles to Taiwan due to the company’s vested interest in China which consumes a huge amount of its commercial aircraft and will be assembling them soon. But under a lease agreement, where the F-15s are furnished by the U.S. government, not Boeing, this would be a moot point. 2010 PACOM briefing Still, even though the Eagle offers outstanding capabilities, even in its earlier configurations, the F-35B that Taiwan really wants provides a whole other set of abilities. But stealth and advanced sensor fusion aren’t really the jet’s most important factor for Taipei, the fact that it can do what the Eagle simply cannot—takeoff and land from very short strips —is what makes it so attractive. Fighters regularly practice operating from sections of highway in Taiwan, but those areas are well known to Chinese intelligence and far larger compared to the potentially small operating areas that F-35Bs or AV-8Bs could operate from., AP With that in mind, maybe providing Taiwan with AV-8B Harriers could be an additional compromise. We have talked at length how the USMC’s Harrier fleet will become a hot commodity as it exits the Pentagon’s inventory, but whereas other potential operators would want it for shipboard operations , Taiwan would want it for land-basing out of austere and widely dispersed locales during a crisis. Currently a large portion of the USMC’s Harrier force are made up of AV-8B+s which carry second-hand APG-65 radars which were pulled from Legacy Hornet’s noses during an earlier upgrade of that jet. They still have a robust AIM-120 AMRAAM capability, but a Harrier with a compact AESA array could be a very capable anti-air weapon system, especially for cruise missile defense, that can also hide in the countryside. But above all else, the AV-8B would be able to strike maritime targets and provide high air-ground/surface sortie rates during a conflict. USN So maybe the best solution for Taiwan, at least one that is politically possible at this time, is to lease second-hand Eagles as well as AV-8Bs when they come available. Eventually Taiwan can take what it has learned from short-takeoff and landing Harrier operations and roll it into the F-35B when it finally gets cleared to acquire them, which is likely still many years away. In the end the idea of leasing Eagles to Taiwan is an intriguing one, albeit we have to wait and see if it actually is something that materializes. And the Harrier acquisition seems even more logical and obtainable, although it may be a bit more logistically challenging at this time.

Bashar al Assad claims to have driven his own Honda Accord into East Ghouta on Sunday, with the Syrian government posting video of him behind the wheel during the trip to the horrifically brutal and bloody combat zone located on the eastern outskirts of Damascus. The stunt is a propaganda play but a somewhat familiar one, and we still don’t know how authentic the little road trip actually was. Assad supposedly took the drive so that he could visit regime troops that are fighting in the area, some of which have made notable advances in recent days. Rebel fighters have been largely split off into three separated pockets. Reuters reports that the regime has tried to sow division among rebels forces fighting in each of the three pockets by entering secretive talks with some but not others. Military pressure has been strategically applied to help with the regime’s divisive plan, and that pressure has c ontinued to be catastrophic to civilians trapped in the area. Below are four clips of Assad driving into East Ghouta posted by the official Youtube channel of the Syrian President, you can see all eight here . The fifth video is of Assad visiting with his forces. It is a chaotic scene, but his plain clothes body guards are in tow along with his uniformed guards with their CAR-15s. Still the scene looks risky to say the least with a lot of small arms on all sides, although we don’t know exactly how staged it actually is. Finally, there is a video of Assad meeting with his command staff in a nearby command post. https://youtube.com/watch?v=I_wCzamUgjM https://youtube.com/watch?v=eZCqP4A88hk https://youtube.com/watch?v=NRkzFijKgLs https://youtube.com/watch?v=3qakG4GfeAw https://youtube.com/watch?v=otCfJ3aeNdQ https://youtube.com/watch?v=9AOunggqI9I There is no doubt that Assad has become very emboldened as a result of his recent spate of military success as of late—which only came via backing by Russian forces and Iranian proxies. But even if Assad did drive into the edge East Ghouta, he unquestionably would have had a detail of bodyguards in tow. The choice of vehicle is also logical, not just because it makes him look like a down to earth dictator, but because a Honda Accord isn’t a huge rolling target like a heavily armored SUV or S550 Mercedes. Not only is Assad cognizant of the possibility of an attack from opposition forces, but he is also well aware of aerial capabilities Israel and the U.S. have in the region. It is impossible to think that Assad isn’t paranoid of being taken out from above, regardless of the geopolitical realities surrounding such an action. It is known that the Syrian strongman does like to drive himself , but he usually doesn’t do so directly onto or very near a battlefield. In the last year he has also made appearances driving a black Kia Sportage (below), and it seems most of his solo appearances behind the wheel occur deep in uncontested territory, usually near Syria’s coast. This video from 2013 shows him driving a far more conspicuous 2014 Porsche Panamera: Assad’s propensity to drive himself around aside, the humanitarian situation in East Ghouta remains dire in many areas. Although some wounded and innocent civilians have been able to evacuate, many remain. The onslaught has been so brutal that it now has the possibility of touching off a much wider conflict. France has threatened to strike Assad’s forces if they do not deescalate, and Russian claims the U.S. is gearing up to do the same, especially among accusations of continued use of chemical weapons by Assad on his own people. Russia says it will respond in kind against U.S. interests if Washington launches an attack. France has also warned its journalists to leave the country immediately , and to not plan future trips. French President Emmanuel Macron stated the following on Friday: “The day we, particularly in tandem with our American partners, have irrefutable proof that the red line has been crossed—namely, through the use of chemical weapons to lethal—we will do what the Americans did more than a few months ago now; we would put ourselves in a position to proceed with targeted strikes.” East Ghouta is largely in ruins. Much of the population has hunkered down underground due to the constant air strikes. , AP Secretary of Defense Mattis also warned Syria to not use gas , or suffer the consequences. If the whole of East Ghouta falls to Assad’s forces it will be the largest rebel loss since Aleppo, but at this point the momentum seems on the regime’s side.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Jan 10, 2019",The KC-46 Pegasus Tanker Program Is Still A Mess,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As an October 2018 deadline for the delivery of the first 18 KC-46 Pegasus tankers and nine refueling pods quickly approaches, Boeing’s 767-based next generation tanker is facing mounting problems. Just this week three new “category I” issues, which are considered major, have been publicly identified. And these are on top of other critical issues with the tanker that still have not been fixed. Delays have vexed the high-profile program, but cost overruns are falling squarely on Boeing, who entered into a fixed-price deal for development and initial examples of the KC-46 tanker years ago. You are probably wondering how strange and unacceptable it is that the USAF, and especially Boeing for that matter, a company that rapidly developed the KC-135 over 60 years ago, is having such a hard time just developing a new tanker. What’s worse is that said tanker is built on a platform that has been flying since 1981 and has already been delivered in a tanker configuration to two allies. Boeing In early 2015, I detailed this outrageous reality in a past editorial feature titled Broken Booms: Why Is It So Hard To Develop & Procure A New USAF Tanker? I suggest you give it a read as it has only proven to be more accurate and damning as the KC-46 program has continued to falter. Here are some of the major issues the program continues to struggle with: The KC-46’s boom has an unacceptably high chance of scraping the skin of receiver aircraft. This is especially troublesome for the USAF’s growing inventory of stealthy airframes—F-35, F-22, B-2 and in the coming decade, the B-21—that rely on their delicate radar absorbent coatings to remain hidden from enemy sensors. It also would cause persistent damage to many other airframes that rely on boom and receptacle refueling. What’s worse is that boom operators can’t even tell when they have impacted the aircraft’s skin, so they can’t relay that information to receiving aircraft. Such a mishap may result in a mission kill, but at least it wouldn’t mean a combat loss if the pilot knew it had occurred. The Remote Vision System—a control console with 3D screens that takes the place of a window and boom operator’s pod traditionally built into the tail of a tanker aircraft—is failing to perform as expected. And this in turn only exacerbates the first issue of the boom scraping away at the skin of the aircraft it services. The Remote Vision System is one needless feature in particular that I especially loathed in my editorial piece previously linked. The centerline drogue, one of up to three on the aircraft, used to refuel probe-equipped aircraft like those flown by the Navy and Marine Corps, keeps disconnecting inadvertently from receiver aircraft. Considering that aerial refueling is already a delicate task, and that probe equipped aircraft take much longer to refuel than those that use the boom, this issue could become very frustrating for pilots, and especially when trying to refuel in bad weather, at night, or under tense situations . The KC-46’s high-frequency radio does not stay turned off during refueling operations as it should. The aircraft’s boom shoves forward into the receptacle violently when fuel flow is turned off and it disconnects. The KC-46s boom was also the focus of another issue which made it unsafe to refuel larger aircraft. A software fix failed to solve the problem and a redesigned boom was in the works as a result. It isn’t clear if this issue has been fully remedied either. There are other issues as well, but these are the top tier ones that have emerged or have plagued the program as of late. Further delays in the program will impact the USAF’s plan to retire its force of 58 KC-10 Extender tankers as the KC-46 comes online. This is also somewhat new as the KC-10s were originally going to be replaced via another tanker procurement program dubbed KC-Y , with yet another tanker program following it around the late 2030s called KC-Z. Now it looks like the USAF plans on skipping the KC-Y initiative altogether. A impressive lineup of KC-10 Extenders., Rockwell Collins According to Defense News’s Valerie Insinna , in total the USAF looks to field a force of 179 KC-46s and 300 KC-135s, for a total of 479 tankers, which is 24 more tankers than the USAF currently has. The KC-46 is also superior in capability compared to the KC-135, so the tradeoff will be an overall capability gain in terms of available net fuel and cargo transportation ability even with the lumbering KC-10s out of the picture. But the KC-10 is larger and in many ways more capable than the KC-46. Its absence will be felt, especially for very-long range and high capacity refueling and cargo hauling operations. As for the USAF’s confidence that Boeing will meet the current deadline, it seems to be quite low , with projections of an eight month or longer delay being forecasted. The KC-X program is now over a decade old, but it really dates back much further, to around 2002 when a scheme to lease and buy a number of 767 tankers was put forward, with Senator John McCain being a principal backer. The first tanker built on the 767 platform flew 13 years ago, although the KC-46 is an amalgam of various 767 variants components. The KC-767s that were built continue in service with the Italian Air Force and the Japan Air Self Defense Force. The USAF will eventually get a working KC-46, it’s just a matter of when. And the fixed price contract scheme saved the tax payer billions in overruns, which is a good thing. In the end its better that the USAF receive a KC-46 that is capable and reliable, than rush airframes onto the ramp that are anything but, and Defense Secretary Mattis seems to agree with this sentiment. The KC-46 is also likely be the basis for a number of critical aircraft replacement programs in the future. Some good news for the program has emerged though. Japan has ordered its first KC-46 , which makes it the first export customer of the type. Japan’s KC-46s will join the four KC-767s in service along with their four E-767 Airborne Warning And Control System aircraft. The KC-10 has capabilities the USAF is likely to miss even with the KC-46 online and operational., Tyler Rogoway With the retirement of the KC-10, maybe the USAF could prioritize a low-observable (stealth) tanker-transport program in place of the skipped-over KC-Y initiative. Even combining that aborted effort with an accelerated KC-Z program could make sense in the coming decade. The USAF is fully aware that its tankers are increasingly vulnerable, and considering how anti-access capabilities are proliferating, the flying force’s fleet of stealthy but very thirsty tactical jets will become less relevant in a peer state conflict without having a survivable source of fuel flying within their combat radius. KC-46 undergoing testing in the anechoic chamber at Edwards AFB., USAF Even the best of the KC-135 fleet can’t fly forever, nor can C-17s, the oldest of which will be meeting their end of service life in the late 2020s, for which there is no available replacement. Replacing some of these with an aircraft that can survive at least along the fringes of contested airspace, or even penetrate a distance into it , would not only be logical, but potentially necessary for future battles to come. A stealthy tanker-transport program, along with KC-46s and increased contractor tanker support, could allow the KC-135 to finally retire around the middle part of the century, by which time many of them will be approaching a century of service.

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Dec 30, 2020",This Could Be Your Only Chance To Buy A Flyable Phantom Fighter Jet,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When it comes to warbirds, the F-4 Phantom is the most advanced American fighter ever owned privately. Just one exists, an F-4D, and it belongs to the Collings Foundation which flies it occasionally for air shows and other events. But another Phantom exists in private hands that could bring the number of civilian-flown Phantoms to two—and it’s for sale. McDonnell Douglas F4H-1F Phantom Bu.145310—just the 11th Phantom built and before the aircraft got its ultimate designation of F-4—is being presented for sale by Platinum Fighters according to our friends over at Warbirdsnews.com . Supposedly the jet is the only privately owned Phantom that is capable of being restored to flying condition, of which roughly 85 percent of the work has already been done. Platinum Fighters Only 45 F4H-1Fs were built, and they used an earlier variant of the famed J-79 turbojet than widely produced F-4 models that came after. Part of the work remaining to be done of the aircraft includes upgrading its engines, of which five are included in the sale price, to a later standard. Ejection seats also need to be activated and the jet’s avionics need to be upgraded as well. The price tag of acquiring the ultimate toy in its yet to be flyable condition? A cool $3.95M. But for that price you also get a full set of external fuel tanks and a pair of drag chutes—I don’t think even Cal could do better than that! As for the jet up for sale, it has lived a very colorful life, one that was intrinsic to the very success of the Phantom as a whole. Being just the 11th Phantom to roll out of the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis—first taking to the skies in 1959, a whopping 60 years ago—the aircraft worked as part of the original development and testing cadre for the Phantom program. It was the first jet to be modified with hardpoints and went on to drop 22 bombs during a major demonstration for the USAF at Fort Bragg, one which ended with the service deciding to purchase the Navy jet. It was also part of a group of three Phantoms to take part in the ‘Sageburner’ low-altitude speed record initiative. Wartbirdnews.com describes the event as such: “Bu.145310 was also one of three Phantom IIs selected to take part in the famous ‘Sageburner’ low altitude world air speed record attempts over a 3km course at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Sadly the first such attempt ended in disaster on May 18th, 1961 when F4H-1F Bu.145316 experienced pitch damper failure. This lead to pilot-induced-oscillations, and due to the aircraft’s enormous speed at the time, these rapid pitch movements immediately overstressed the airframe, which experienced catastrophic structural failure and disintegrated in flight with the loss of her crew, Commander Jack L. Felsman and Ensign Raymond M. Hite, Jr. Undeterred, however, the Navy achieved their goal later that year on August 18th when Lieutenants Huntington Hardisty and Earl De Esch flew F4H-1F Bu.145307 to an average speed of 902.714mph over a 3km closed course…. all at an altitude of less than 125 feet! This aircraft is now part of the National Air & Space Museum’s collection.” 145310 during operation Sageburner., USN The jet continued its testing and demonstration work through the fall of 1964, when it was retired with just 461 hours on its airframe. Over the next 40 years the jet was passed around from museum collection to museum collection, before ending up in the hands of Rich Wall in 2003. It’s then that Aircraft Restoration Services LLC at the French Valley Airport in California began a painstakingly detailed restoration of the aircraft. They are hoping to complete the job for its new owner. Now with the jet fairly close to be ready to take to the skies again, there has to be some very wealthy airplane nerd willing to plunk down the cash to realize their Phantom dreams. Paul Allen of Microsoft and Vulcan Companies fame comes to mind. He already has his own air force that includes flying examples of the F-5 and maybe the world’s most cherry MiG-29. Adding a Phantom to the mix only seems logical. One does have to wonder how hard it will be to keep what is essentially a pre-production version of the F-4, with some minor differences (windscreen configuration for instance), in the air. But really it is nothing huge gobs of cash and love for going really fast can’t solve. If anything else, the new owner would be the most popular dude at Oshkosh , and you may even be able to sell the jet for more than you put into it once it’s actually roaring through the twilight skies over Wisconsin . For more on this exclusive offering, check out Platinum Fighters . Actually check them out anyway because they pretty much are a vending machine that converts your cash into realized fevered dreams. You can even buy this SAAB Draken from them and stage your own spectacular dogfights.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Just as India’s once again hits the reset button on its premier fighter aircraft procurement program and becomes ever more disillusioned with Russia’s 5th generation fighter offering, the head of U.S. Pacific Command has supposedly stated that he supports the sale of F-35s to India. This would be the first official admission that such a possibility is even on the table, although The War Zone has long suspected this would be the case. First reported on by Stratpost.com , during a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing USPACOM boss Admiral Harry Harris Jr. is quotes as stating the following: “At the moment, India is considering a number of U.S. systems for purchase, all of which USPACOM fully supports: the F-16 for India’s large single-engine, multi-role fighter acquisition program; the F/A-18E for India’s multi-engine, carrier-based fighter purchase; a reorder of 12-15 P-8Is; a potential purchase of SeaGuardian UAS; MH-60R multi-role sea-based helicopter; and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter… …India will be among the U.S.’s most significant partners in the years to come due to its growing influence and expanding military. As a new generation of political leaders emerge, India has shown that it is more open to strengthening security ties with the U.S. and adjusting its historic policy of non-alignment to address common strategic interests. The U.S. seeks an enduring, regular, routine, and institutionalized strategic partnership with India. USPACOM identifies a security relationship with India as a major command line-of-effort… …USPACOM will sustain the momentum of the strategic relationship generated by the POTUS-Prime Minister-level and the emerging 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue through strengthening our military-to-military relationship and working toward additional enabling agreements to enhance interoperability… …Over the past year, U.S. and Indian militaries participated together in three major exercises, executed more than 50 other military exchanges, and operationalized the 2016 Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA). Defense sales are at an all-time high with India operating U.S.-sourced airframes, such as P-8s, C-130Js, C-17s, AH-64s, and CH-47s, and M777 howitzers.” The potential confirmation comes after India has denied that they are interested in the F-35, or that they have been briefed directly on the program. But rumors of background talks about the possibility of purchasing the stealth fighter have persisted. AP The possibility of F-35s wearing Indian Air Force roundels is not new. During the Obama Administration, as India tightened up more and more with the United States, the possibility was often discussed in defense circles and by the author of this post. But that administration was far heavier handed when it came to controlling weapons exports compared to the Trump Administration, which has a not so secret affinity for selling American weaponry to allies abroad. The threat China poses in the region is also accelerating, and India in particular is being faced with Beijing’s extra-territorial assertiveness more than ever . The F-35 could go a long way in counter-balancing China’s rapidly modernizing air combat capabilities, including the introduction of its own low-observable fighter, the J-20 , into service recently. India’s need for fighters that can operate from land and from ships, with catapults and without , could prove to make the F-35 especially enticing, as the Indian MoD could use all three variants in the coming years. Obviously tight export controls would have to be part of any F-35 deal with India, and it is very unlikely that technology transfer or major industrial offsets would be included in a purchase. But India could buy other aircraft, even the F-16 Viper or F/A-18 Super Hornet, or something from another country, to accomplish those goals. So an F-35 purchase would be a longer-term strategic play, with the possibility of industrial offsets and technology transfer occurring much farther down the line. F-35 tests its dorsal drogue chute enclosure during recent trials. , Lockheed Martin The big question is does India needs the F-35’s capabilities in the near term, even if that means eating into their budget for other tactical jet programs. That’s a question that we will have to wait to have answered, but New Delhi could jettison its PAK-FA deal with Russia—which is based on a variant of the Su-57 —and divert those separate funds to an F-35 procurement initiative. Such a move would enrage Russia, which is banking on Indian funds to help sustain and stabilize the Su-57 program, a jet which Moscow is having trouble buying itself. Above all else, if this report is accurate, we have our first official admission that the F-35 is very well in play when it comes to U.S.-Indian military cooperation. With high-level talks between both countries defense officials scheduled in the weeks to come, we may hear more about a Joint Strike Fighter’s possible sale to India soon.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 13, 2018",Navy Ditches Its Plan To Upgrade 34 Destroyers With Hybrid Electric Drives,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The seagoing service has officially cancelled its plans to retrofit 34 of its Arleigh Burke class destroyers with hybrid-electric drives. The modified propulsion systems were supposedly going to enhance endurance and reduce fuel consumption, among other advantages. I wrote about the ambitious plan back in 2015, stating : “Starting next year, the Navy will retrofit 34 of its newest Arleigh Burke Class destroyers with an electric motor tied to the ship’s main reduction gear, which will be able to propel the ship at speeds below about 13 knots. At higher speeds, where the ship’s LM-2500 gas turbines are more efficient, the ships will run on traditional power. The end effect will be better endurance for typical destroyer missions, such as executing ballistic missile defense, where cruising at lower speeds are usually standard operating procedure. The Navy says that using the system 50 percent of the time will result in as much as two and a half days of extra time between refueling and thousands of barrels of fuel saved during a typical deployment. The Navy plans on initially outfitting a pair of destroyers with the system in 2016 and four ships a year after that.” But in the Pentagon’s 2019 budget all its funds for program have been cut, as Defense News’s David Larter points out . So far the Navy has spent $52M on the initiative with the total cost to retrofit the 34 destroyers set at $356M. USN The reasoning behind the abandonment of a program the Navy had put a high priority on just a couple years prior is multi-fold. The Navy says it has other priorities that are more pressing than the hybrid drive upgrade program, and that they have no intention of spinning the program back up in the future—at least at this time. As such, USS Truxtun (DDG-103) will be the only existing Arleigh Burke class destroyer with the system fitted and will serve as something of a test ship for the retrofitted hybrid electric drive concept going forward. The other reason for axing the hybrid electric drive retrofit program is that it seems to have run into some technological and engineering hurdles that simply made it less viable and logical without further developmental investment. These ships have three generators, two of which are operational at any given time. When steaming under 13 knots on the hybrid drive’s electrical power, the load on those two active generators is extreme, making the ship vulnerable to blackouts and taxing its electrical distribution system to the max. Guided missile destroyers are notoriously electricity hungry, with their powerful Aegis radar system and other sensors and combat systems requiring lots of juice, especially in combat situations. “At that point you are a light switch flipping on away from winking out the whole ship,” a Navy official told Larter in reference to the hybrid drive system. Also, because the two running generators have to be pushed so hard while the hybrid electric drive is active, the fuel savings has turned out to be less impressive than originally envisioned. USN Still, the technology is the future of naval propulsion, and various versions of it are in use on commercial ships around the world, as well as on the latest ‘Gator Navy’ amphibious flattops. The Zumwalt class destroyers use an even more elaborate electrical drive system for propulsion, but to our knowledge the upcoming Flight III Arleigh Burke class destroyers will have increased power capacity to support its powerful SPY-6 radar and future growth potential, but that will come in the form of three uprated generators , not a hybrid electric drive system. Truxtun’s crew and the yard workers post in front of the ship’s massive props. Photo dated March 6th, 2018., USS Truxtun Facebook page But designing a ship around this propulsion concept is one thing, retrofitting it back into existing vessels—especially combat ships with all sorts of unique demands and constraints—is another. In the end it sounds like the Navy made the right call. If Truxtun can be tweaked to make the system work within acceptable tolerances over time than maybe there is a case to be made for the retrofitting plan once again. In the mean time the Navy does have other priorities, and the idea of actually handicapping the backbone of their surface combatant fleet with this still temperamental technology is not worth the rewards. In fact it is refreshing seeing the service try something ambitious and reevaluate before doubling down on a very risky and expensive concept with questionable returns. Such a move could very well be the product of recent hard-learned lessons from other higher-profile programs. It will be interesting to see how Truxtun adapts to their new propulsion system and how that ship’s crew will cope with its current limitations.

Our good friend James Drew over at Aviation Week posted a story that included new details and new pictures of Boeing’s MQ-25 entrant. According to Drew, Boeing’s Phantom Works had painted a large piece of tarmac at Lambert Field in St. Louis in the outline of an aircraft carrier’s deck, and have been executing mock shipboard suitability and deck handling tests, both during day and night. During one of these tests is probably when this picture was taken of the drone which The War Zone initially published on January 9th, 2018. The ground tests included locking the aircraft into a mock catapult and parking it in some of the tightest dimensional spaces on the flight deck. Drew also notes that the concept by which Boeing testers are controlling the drone during taxi operations remains unknown. Northrop Grumman previously used a glove-like apparatus to direct their now defunct X-47B demonstrator around the carrier deck, but such a contraption doesn’t seem to be in use when it comes to Boeing’s carrier-based drone prototype. Northrop Grumman’s X-47B went to the boat using this wearable apparatus for controlling deck movements. , USN And as we have long suspected, Boeing’s MQ-25 design originally began development back in 2012 for the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program that was later withered down into a tanker drone with some ancillary surveillance potential. In fact, the airframe itself was secretly finished in 2014, before being put into storage until it was revived for the Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS)/MQ-25 tender. So in essence, the design is not ‘clean-sheet’ for the tanking mission, although Boeing says they had that also in mind when designing it, and it isn’t clear what was modified on the aircraft to meet the CBARS/MQ-25 requirements—but more on that in a moment. Drew does mention that the aircraft’s small air inlet on its nose is used for environmental cooling, as we suspected. Also the camera system seen on the drone is just for testing purposes, an electro-optical sensor turret will eventually be fitted should the company win the contract to build four prototypes. He also notes that Boeing is not pitching their entrant as low-observable, but clearly it has many low observable features—which are a byproduct of its UCLASS roots—but the long, slender, glider-like wings that we are just now getting a full view of in detail are not stealthy at all. Boeing says that their aircraft will be able to meet the CBARS requirements with substantial margin built in. That is a high order as the Navy’s future MQ-25 has to unload seven tons of gas to other aircraft after flying 500 miles from the carrier and then have enough fuel to return to the boat. The ability to accomplish such a feat relies a lot on the aircraft’s wing design, which looks particularly well suited for loitering and endurance at altitude as opposed to speed and agility. One has to wonder what wings Boeing’s MQ-25 wore before it was repurposed as a tanker drone, and with that in mind, it’s pretty easy to imagine Boeing’s design being reconfigured as a somewhat stealthy platform used exclusively for surveillance and light strike missions. An internal weapons bay seems plausible (and we may have already spotted it ) considering the fuselage design, and it may even be there already considering the aircraft was originally designed for such a mission set. In light of what we know now about Boeing’s MQ-25 wing design, the question of where the government furnished Cobham aerial refueling pod will be mounted is a relevant one. It seems that the aircraft’s centerline will be the most logical location. It’s not clear if the wings will feature any sort of plumbed hardpoints that could accommodate the pod or external fuel tanks, but considering its thin chord, it seems doubtful. And those wings don’t look like they can hold much gas either, making one wonder if 14,000 pounds of gas can fit inside its fuselage alone. That’s just over an F-15C’s full internal fuel load, and that doesn’t count the gas the MQ-25 needs to make it 500 miles to its tanking position and back to the boat. We also still don’t know who is part of Boeing’s team for their MQ-25 entrant. The engine manufacturer and type are particularly of interest considering the design’s exotic flush-fitted air inlet configuration—one that is historically problematic when it comes to airflow, especially at higher angles of attack, like when landing aboard an aircraft carrier. As we reported on in-depth recently, Boeing claims this is a ‘must-win’ contract and has even gone as far as teaming up as a subcontractor with General Atomics on their own MQ-25 entrant. Of course that relationship would only go into effect if General Atomics wins the competition. But considering it’s really just the MQ-25 and the USAF’s T-X jet trainer as far as major aircraft programs up for grabs in the near future, Boeing’s historic St. Louis plant needs one of them to carry the facility through as the Super Hornet’s production run dims . Even if Boeing wins the day, it will be for just four airframes that aren’t scheduled to arrive until roughly 2024. The Navy says it will begin buying MQ-25s in bulk two years later if it likes what it sees, with up to 76 airframes being delivered in total. So it’s not a huge program even if it makes it to initial operating capability. Some think, including one NAVAIR insider The War Zone recently talked to, that the service, which has a major cultural aversion to unmanned carrier aviation, will “strangle the MQ-25 in the crib” long before it gets to that point. And considering how the program has devolved over the years that isn’t an unwarranted assumption. But regardless of cultural headwinds or naysayers, the future of tactical combat aviation is unmanned , and the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) realm is especially attractive when it comes to carrier operations. With this in mind, if Boeing can get a foothold in this space with the Navy, it could mean the company would have a huge advantage when it comes to fielding more advanced and plentiful unmanned carrier-borne aircraft systems down the line. And some of those systems could just end up being Boeing’s current MQ-25 design reverted to its earlier stealthier configuration. As they say in the corporate world, “product synergy” is a good thing.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Cessna is hard at work on a totally new twin turboprop design that will allow the company to go after a relatively underserved market for a small but hardy twin engine aircraft capable of hauling outsized cargo or passengers into austere locations. And like its singe turboprop Caravan cousin, the Skycourier seems ideally suited for military applications as well. Skycourier’s performance goals are fairly straight forward: 200 knots max cruise, 900 mile max range, and a 6,000lb max cargo hauling capacity. Its unpressurized fuselage will feature an oversized cargo door and will be capable of swallowing up three standard LD3 shipping containers or 19 passengers. Its gear is designed to handle unprepared airfields, which means the Caravan’s rough and tough pedigree carries over. It also will feature a single point refueling system and the latest Garmin 1000 avionics suite. But above all else, this aircraft is being designed to be run very hard with minimal interruptions. As Cessna’s literature says, “fly, unload, and repeat.” Cargo and passenger configurations of the Skycourrier., Cessna/Textron What may be attractive to cargo haulers and charter companies will be equally attractive to militaries around the globe. Cessna’s Caravan is used by air arms to deliver personnel and cargo to remote areas, to act as skydiving platforms, and as surveillance and strike assets, with some being armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. Iraqi Air Force Currently Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan fly Hellfire armed ‘Combat Caravans’ which have proven themselves as very efficient hunter-killer platforms over the years. Other countries, including some in Africa, also fly US furnished Caravans outfitted for surveillance and reconnaissance. Orbital ATK offers one heavily armed version, which it presently calls the AC-208 Eliminator , on the open market, as well. AC-208 Eliminator, Orbital ATK/Northrop Grumman The Skycourier could not only supplant or supplement the Caravan in some roles, it could also replace Shorts Skyvans , CASA 212s , and M28 Skytrucks in service around the globe.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Nov 13, 2017",Two Of The Navy’s Youngest Perry Class Frigates Are Set To Be Sunk,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The USS Ingraham (FFG-61) and the USS Ford (FFG-54) are set aside to be sunk during sinking exercises (SINKEX), and Ford could be bombed, torpedoed, and shot until it succumbs to its watery grave as soon as this fall for Valiant Shield 2018. Both ships are among the youngest Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates currently in the Navy’s mothball fleet, both having been retired between three and four years ago. Ingraham in particular is the last of the class built in the United States, having been commissioned in 1989. Both of the vessels call Bremerton home as they silently await their destruction. Five other vessels have been set aside for SINKEX duties as well, including two Charleston class amphibious cargo ships, a Newport class amphibious landing ship, and two older Perry class frigates. USN document Ingraham and Ford , along with the two other FFGs set aside for SINKEX drills are joined by another ten Perry class frigates set aside for foreign sales, the majority of which are older. USN Document There are another eight Perry class frigates set aside for scrapping. USN Document Using retired vessels for sinking exercises is widely beneficial. Not only are they the best training various maritime warfare crews can get, but they are also key in gathering critical data on the real-world effects of various weapon systems and how various parts of a vessel perform against actual kinetic attacks. Perry class frigates are particularly attractive targets for SINKEX because they were built very stout and can handle an unbelievable amount of damage before sinking. In fact, even after being pummeled by subsurface, surface, and aerial weapons, explosive charges still may be needed to send the ship to the seabed. But sinking two of the youngest of the Perry fleet seems nearsighted especially as the Navy struggles to come up with a plan to realize its 355 ship fleet goal. There were high hopes that a number of Perry class frigates—at least seven hulls—could be returned to service even if just for low-threat environment operations, such as drug interdiction or anti-piracy operations. Meanwhile some have argued for the ships to receive modern upgrades like their counterparts that still serve with allied navies around the world. USS Ford , USN In the end the Navy brass decided to do nothing with the Perry fleet—an unsurprising move considering the service’s obsession with buying new ships and high-end technologies over maintaining the vessels it already has . Shipbuilding politics and congressional pork also play a major factor in such decisions as well. Making matters more concerning is that when you look at the Navy’s fiscal justification for deciding to sink, chop up, or sell off the frigates for next to nothing to allies instead of putting put back to work for the United States, it just doesn’t add up. Regardless of the Navy’s decision as it sits now not to regenerate the Perry class, as foreign transfers, the scrappers torch, or torpedoes and anti-ship missiles take more of these ships out of the reserve fleet, the Navy will have a dwindling parts source if they were to decide to change course and reintroduce the ships into fleet in one role or another—even during a major crisis. Additionally, one has to wonder why some of the youngest retired frigates need to be used as targets instead of much older ones that are already set aside for scrapping. USS Ingraham looking sharp with a massive stars and stripes flying while pulling into port at the end of her final deployment., USN Such a plan also calls into question the viability of the Navy’s ever shrinking reserve fleet in the first place, especially during a time of supposed “great power competition” between the United States and peer states like Russia and China. Considering it takes many years to build a ship, retaining a sizable force of Perry class frigates in reserve, on which modular weapon systems could bolted during a time of need, seems like a good if not wholly necessary insurance policy to have.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",USAF Officially Retires MQ-1 Predator While MQ-9 Reaper Set To Gain Air-To-Air Missiles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Reaper has come for the USAF’s long-serving MQ-1 Predator drone fleet, literally. Today, March 9th, 2018, the flying service will officially retire Predator, a platform that ushered in a new era of unmanned air warfare—most notably the ability to rain down precision death as its controllers sat halfway around the globe in dark trailers. The decision to pull the Predator fleet is a previously preempted and controversial one , but its legacy is secured in the form of its super-sized cousin, the MQ-9 Reaper, an aircraft that will become the backbone of USAF drone operations. And with its elevated importance within the USAF’s inventory, the Reaper is going to gain new capabilities and an expanded mission set, including the ability to fire air-to-air missiles. You can read all about how the Predator went from a useful surveillance tool to an airborne assassin and the divisive star of the Global War on Terror in this past article of mine . But Predator won’t totally disappear as it serves in other roles globally and surplus USAF airframes, of which there are many, will end up in the Navy’s hands , and likely under the control of contractors here at home and in the fleets of friendly allies’ air arms as well. Reaper evolution Just as the MQ-1 leaves the USAF’s active inventory, the MQ-9 is getting a series of upgrades that will add new elements to its already diverse capabilities list. Presently the Reaper is used for surveillance or strike missions, and the USAF is trying to blend these two mission sets more smoothly together. The latest variant of the MQ-9 can fly upwards of 40 hours when not carrying weapons. A Predator and Reaper operating out of Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. , USAF The Reaper’s hardpoints give it the ability to carry a mix of AGM-114 Hellfire, GBU-12 Paveway, and now GBU-38 JDAM munitions . In contrast, its forbearer, the Predator, can only carry two Hellfires. Typically a Reaper’s external payload totals no more than about 2,500lbs on a strike mission, but that enables the Reaper to carry four Hellfire missiles and a pair of harder-hitting 500lb Paveways or JDAMs. In the future, guided micro-munitions will give Reapers a deeper and more flexible magazine. A variety of surveillance, fuel, communications relay, and electronic warfare pods, including Wide Area Aerial Surveillance (WAAS) camera arrays can and are carried on the Reaper’s pylons. These systems are supplemental to the drone’s nose-mounted MTS-B multi-spectral surveillance and targeting turret and its fuselage mounted Lynx synthetic aperture radar . A ventral hardpoint allows for larger radar systems to be mounted in a semi-permanent enclosure. USAF The USAF is eyeing putting more powerful radar systems onboard some Reapers in an attempt to help build-out a ‘system of systems’ of ground moving targeting identification (GMTI) sensor nodes that can be distributed around the battlefield. This is part of the overall effort to replace E-8C JSTARS planes in a decentralized manner and to increase resiliency and capability for the critical GMTI mission set. GMTI is a radar capability that tracks moving targets on the ground over time using radar. These systems have gotten more advanced and smaller in recent years, with some podded systems being able to track human movements and other small ‘patterns of life’ related data points. RQ-9 Guardian, US Border Patrol The Reapers have the ability to field a more capable radar via the addition of an underwing pod or by activating their ventral hardpoint. The latter of which has been done for maritime patrol optimized variants of the Reaper commonly referred to as “Guardian.” Back to the future with unmanned air-to-air In addition to a possible radar upgrade option, the Reaper is also going to get the ability to employ air-to-air missiles . This is truly a ‘back to the future’ moment in that the Predator was outfitted to carry AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles under an urgent development initiative led by the USAF’s Big Safari office 16 years ago. Air Force Magazine recounts the lightning fast initiative and its wild outcome: “Some Predators were armed with the AIM-92 Stinger missile, to defend themselves against Iraqi fighters. Getting the Stinger certified on the Predator took only 91 days. On Dec. 23, 2002—less than three months before Operation Iraqi Freedom began—a Stinger-armed Predator was performing reconnaissance over a no-fly zone when an Iraqi MiG-25 turned in to attack. The Predator fired at the MiG-25, and the TV imagery showed the smoke trails of the two missiles crossing in midair. Unfortunately, the MiG’s missile downed the Predator, but the Iraqi Air Force apparently drew the conclusion the US would have wanted them to: that there was no future in combating Stinger-armed Predators. There were no further attacks against the UAVs.” I wrote a bit more detailed account based on information I had heard back in 2012: “By 2002 the saber-rattling between the Bush Administration and Saddam’s gang of war criminals and military puppets (who can every forget goons like “Baghdad Bob,” Tariq Aziz, and “Chemical” Ali?) had reached a thundering crescendo. IAEA inspectors were frustrated, the US had assets literally pouring into the region, and the long-established no fly zones were still firmly in place over northern and southern Iraq. As tensions increased Saddam’s forces became more emblazoned and defiant towards coalition aerial patrols. It just seemed crystal clear that war was on its way no-matter what really happened. At the same time, America was continuing to realize the true value of the General Atomics Q-1 series of unmanned aircraft. At the time, less than a decade ago, the USAF only had a small inventory Predators, less than two-dozen to be mores specific, compared with today where well over 200 Q-1 and Q-9 series of unmanned aircraft fly for the USAF. From what I have heard about this unique footnote in military aviation history is that it was somewhat common that MiG-25 Foxbats would make slashing incursions across the no fly zone boundaries, especially when US unmanned aircraft were operating in the areas and when coalition AWACs coverage was offline. The US recognized the increase in Iraqi brazenness and devised a plan to first bait and subsequently deter Iraqi aggression towards unmanned aerial vehicles. At first the Predators would bait the Iraqi fighters to violate the no fly zone boundary and then they would run. Over time a cat and mouse game ensued, until one day the Predator did not run. Instead it made an intercept course for the fast-flying MiG-25. This is where the video posted below comes into play, you see these were no normal RQ-1 Predators, they were in fact armed with a pair of AIM-92 heat-seeking “Stinger” missiles. The MiG-25 is thought to have fired a medium range AA-6 “Acrid” air-to-air missile at a relatively close distance from the diminutive Predator, although still at a long enough distance that the Predator’s AIM-92’s could not lock onto the massive MiG’s heat signature. Thus the Predator fired its missile while the Iraqi’s shot was well on its way. The Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat missile’s hot exhaust confused the Stinger’s infra-red seeker which sent it astray. Foxbat one, Predator zero. In the end the little Predator, pretty much the slowest and lightest combat aircraft in the USAF’s inventory, was brought down by a massive MiG-25, the heaviest and fastest fighter in the Iraqi Air Force at the time. Just like a classic gunfighter’s standoff, the guy that was able to shoot first lived to fight another day, just barely averting mutual destruction. Surely the Iraqi MiG-25 pilot must have been amazed when he saw what amounts to a seemingly defenseless, glorified radio controlled plane shoot back at his mach three capable interceptor.  Yet maybe what at face value seems like a loss for the USAF was in fact exactly the outcome they wanted as that was the last time Iraqi fighters ever pushed an intercept on an unmanned US drone. And that my friends is how the future of unmanned air-to-air combat was born…” Stinger-laden Predators quickly fell out of fashion as the fleet rapidly expanded and became a centerpiece of the Global War on Terror and the controversial “targeted killing” drone assassination program. But over the last decade, American drones have been harassed repeatedly by the Iranians while on patrols over the Persian Gulf. The problem got so bad that F-22s were called in to send a message to roving Iranian tactical jet crews that leaving the unmanned aircraft alone while flying in international airspace was good for their health. Fast forward to today and it’s evident why giving the Reaper the ability to defend itself is attractive—even for deterrent reasons alone. Additionally, these aircraft have had the benefit of operating in largely benign environments since their introduction into service. Future operations may not be so convenient. The air war over Syria, where Reapers are often shadowed by Russian fighters, is a reminder how defenseless these assets are, and because of the limited situational awareness of their operators, it may not even be possible to confirm how one was brought down should such an event occur. This can be a huge problem, especially when one is operating on an essential mission. And in Syria, unmanned aircraft are usually the only coalition aircraft to penetrate into the western part of the country, where Russian forces are deeply entrenched. https://youtube.com/watch?v=oi_qJFzmV_g An air-to-air arrow for the MQ-9’s quiver For the self defense role, the AIM-9X is a far more capable missile than the AIM-92 Stinger. It is capable of shorter beyond visual range engagements, has a wider field of view than its AIM-9L/M predecessor, uses a far superior imaging infrared seeker, and most importantly, it can engage targets far off the aircraft’s centerline. The block II variant also features a data-link that enables lock on after launch capability. It can even engage ground and surface targets under certain circumstances. You can read much more about the AIM-9X and its capabilities here . It may be possible to slave the AIM-9X’s seeker to the Reaper’s sensor turret, which itself may be able to be directed to targets in the MQ-9’s operating environment that are pushed to it from third party platforms via an onboard Link 16 data-link terminal. That information could then be sent back to Reaper’s operators via the aircraft’s standard Ku band satellite communications link. Think of this as a virtual radar of sorts, and there are platforms that specifically support this kind of concept, namely the USAF’s E-11 and EQ-4 BACN aircraft . MQ-9, USAF This would give the Reaper’s operators much higher situational awareness and may allow the AIM-9X to target enemy aircraft at the very edge of its range. It would also allow its operators to obtain positive identification of potential enemies at long ranges prior to firing. If a new radar was added to the Reaper that had an air-to-air mode, the missile’s seeker and the Reaper’s turret could be pointed at targets it sees as well. Additionally, when upgraded with advanced threat sensing gear and software, including the possible fielding of radar warning receiver pods and rudimentary distributed aperture systems , MQ-9 crews could use the AIM-9X to better defend their aircraft than they could otherwise. Even drone sense and avoid technology being developed for civilian uses could be adapted to help the Reaper protect itself with its own missiles against airborne threats. Reaper fitted with ALR-69A radar warning receiver and electronic warfare pod. This system drastically increases the MQ-9’s survivability and its operators situational awareness. It can even help with cueing weapons on enemy targets, like marauding fighters, too., General Atomics What I am getting at here is that the Reaper would not have to point its nose at the enemy in order to shoot at it. Basic fighter maneuvers (dogfighting) in a turbo-prop powered drone with long slender wings, where the pilot is operating on a slight time lag and looking through a ‘soda-straw’ isn’t well-advised. But that is unlikely to be how the MQ-9 would employ such a weapon. Other potential options for self defense may be on the horizon as well, including miniaturized hit-to-kill defensive interceptors . Think of this type of system as an active close-in defense kinetic capability for aircraft. Still, the AIM-9X is readily available and it would give the MQ-9 a good defensive capability in murky, or semi-contested operational environments and when patrolling very close to hostile territory. The aircraft is not designed to survive over highly-contested airspace. Reaper As A Missile Truck Another possibility is fitting MQ-9s with AIM-120 AMRAAMs to serve as forward-deployed air-to-air missiles platforms. This would allow a Reaper to set up a combat air patrol of sorts over a location, with operators using off-board sensor data to track and engage enemy targets. This could be useful when setting up persistent deterrent patrols over key areas, such as forward operating bases in regions where air superiority is not assured. Compared to fighters, a loaded MQ-9 only needs gas roughly once a day instead of every hour, and when it fills up its tank the bill is way cheaper. Operational costs are also less than that of manned fighter assets. And once again, its high-magnification optical sensors could be useful in identifying targets at long distances before firing. A Reaper ground control station., USAF The threat from drones is drastically increasing as well as we have discussed for years. One recent scenario that comes to mind where such a concept could have been handy was the shoot down of two Iranian drones over a forward operating base used by U.S. and allied forces near At Tanf, Syria. A properly outfitted Reaper could even work as a stand-in for ground-based short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems, and even medium ones as well, not to mention taking the place of fighters. The U.S. military’s SHORAD gap is well established, and efforts are finally moving in the direction of closing it. In the future, a Reaper with a solid-state laser could also work as a anti-small drone platform as well. General Atomics’ Advanced Ground Control Station., General Atomics An MQ-9 could also be used to carry extra missiles into an area where fighters are present, with those fighters launching the MQ-9’s missiles on demand remotely once their own magazines run dry. This is a concept we have talked about in great detail , but it’s not as attractive an option for the MQ-9 as it’s comparatively slow and it may have trouble surviving even on the rear edge of contested territory. Just a peek at what’s to come The introduction of the AIM-9X or the AIM-120 into the Reaper’s weapons portfolio is just an example of a radically altered unmanned aerial battlespace that is emerging on the horizon—at least publicly speaking. Although not popularly discussed, the air-to-air environment may be the unmanned aircraft’s best mission of all as I have laid out in my previous special feature on the mysterious absence of high-end unmanned air combat vehicles: For so long UCAVs (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles—stealthy and advanced fighter sized drones) have been seen as strictly deep strike and surveillance platforms, but when networked together, they could offer an incredible counter-air capability. Even the subsonic and less than highly maneuverable but very stealthy flying-wing UCAV configurations that we know of today could be absolutely devastating when it comes to sanitizing enemy airspace. The same swarm technology applies to the air-to-air realm as it does to attacking pop-up SAM sites. In fact, under certain circumstances enemy fighters may be an easier threat for UCAVs to deal with than those emanating from the ground. Enemy aircraft would have a very hard time remaining undetected in airspace that an operational swarm of UCAVs is operating in. Its cloud-like mind will leverage feeds from the multitude of sensors carried by its individual UCAVs, all spread over a wide area. In essence, the swarm acts as is its own virtual AWACS, although in some cases it is far superior as it is forward deployed, can carry a diverse set of sensors spread over a wide area, and the data it collects can be enacted upon instantaneously. If a potential enemy aircraft is detected, even just for a brief moment, multiple sensors aboard multiple UCAVs can instantly and seamlessly steer their sensors (radar, infrared etc) from multiple angles onto the single piece of sky where the aircraft was. Anti-stealth detection tactics can then be employed, aimed at collectively detecting an aircraft well enough to build a weapons-grade engagement track of it. Working as a team, the swarm can then engage the target in question. Once a track is established, the best UCAV or UCAVs positioned to deal with it can be assigned the task of doing so, making long-range coordinated missile shots at the bad guy. Instead of using their own radars alone to guide their missile shots, they can use the swarm’s common “picture” to do so. In other words, the UCAV firing on the enemy aircraft does not even have to use its own sensors to do so as it sees all the other UCAV’s sensor pictures fused together and can use that data instead. This means certain UCAVs, such as those closest to the threat aircraft, can operate “silent,” not emanating any electromagnetic energy. Combined with the UCAV’s wide-band stealthy shape, low infrared signature and radar-absorbent coatings, it is unlikely the target will detect the attacking UCAVs at all. Well at least until their missiles go “pitbull” and lock onto the aircraft during the terminal phase of their attacks, which is likely far too late. Possessing an extreme level of stealth, both in the radio and infrared spectrum, and having near perfect situational awareness, the UCAV swarm is really a flying pack of telepathic robotic wolves that are all working together to kill the bad guy in a coordinated manner. Having a UCAV even sacrifice itself for the greater good can be programmed as a viable tactical choice. When it comes to the within-visual-range air combat environment, the current types of UCAVs could never turn successfully with a modern fighter jet. Yet with the latest block of AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles, which are capable of making greater than 180 degree snap turns and locking onto an enemy aircraft after being launched from an internal weapons bay, the UCAV may not have to maneuver aggressively at all. Then again, avoiding marauding fighters or attacking them with so called “non-kinetic” weaponry would also leverage the UCAV’s unique capabilities. Instead of launching missiles, parts of the swarm could jam and change course to keep themselves outside of the detection range of enemy aircraft. Or they could send pinpoint electronic attacks and pencil-sized high-power beams of electromagnetic energy chirped off by their onboard AESA radars directly at the enemy fighters’ radars and radar-guided missile seekers, blinding, disabling, or destroying them in the process. Even the ability to swat incoming missiles out of the sky with directed energy weapons is clearly on the horizon. Finally, a fully air-to-air optimized UCAV design may be the most awe-inspiring of all UCAVs as such an aircraft’s maneuverability would not be limited by the crushing gravitational forces a human pilot can endure. As such, a UCAV designed to absolutely rule the air-to-air realm could be able to sustain unheard of G forces, making shooting it down with missiles, or trying to parry it in the within-visual-range air combat realm, nearly useless. Regardless of what’s to come in regards to the future of air-to-air combat, the Reaper’s evolution is accelerating after its first decade of service. Now that its game-changing progenitor—an icon of modern warfare—is bowing out of service, the MQ-9 will only become more trail-blazing in its own right. With all this in mind it will be very interesting to see what else the USAF decides to do with its Reapers as it buzzes its way into a second decade of service.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Feb 12, 2018",Here’s A Handy Inventory List Of USAF Aircraft And Their Mission Capable Rates,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The reliability of various USAF aircraft has always been a hot topic within defense circles, but the reality of keeping different platforms in the air has made mainstream news as of late . At the same time, the average person seems to be a bit surprised by the actual number of different types of aircraft in the Air Force’s inventory. So a simple chart showing both metrics would be very helpful, and that’s exactly what our friends over at Scramble posted on their Facebook page recently. The list, which was sourced from the USAF’S data by the Air Force Times , includes four years of mission capable rate (aircraft can fly with all combat systems functional) data as well as the historical change for each platform, for better or worse. The inventory as of 2017 for each aircraft is also posted in its own column. Some may be surprised that even with all the USAF’s complaining about how old and unreliable the airframes are, the E-8C JSTARS was still able to pull off a mission capable rate of 64 percent in 2017, and a respectable 76 percent in 2016. Aircrew cleans the windscreen on a well-worn E-8C., USAF Meanwhile the relatively small fleet of F-22s hit an abysmal 49 percent—basically you need two aircraft available for one sortie—in 2017, down from a paltry 60 percent the year earlier. This is the cost of flying a low-observable, “thoroughbred” fighter. Considering only about 125 are combat coded for front line service at any given, this figure is even more troubling. Over a decade after taking its first flight, the F-35A continues to struggle as well with a 55 percent mission capable rate. This has been a major story as of late , and even though the USAF and Lockheed Martin are working to increase the aircraft’s availability, still only around half are available at any given time. The test fleet full of early examples also draws down this number, but the cost of upgrading those jets to current standard is going to be very high, and still they are unlikely to be on an equal level with their newer counterparts. C-5 in depot., USAF The C-5M Galaxy —a re-engined and updated refit of earlier C-5 models —continues to struggle. This is especially troubling considering the massive investment in these aircraft to make them more reliable and the drawdown of the fleet. Its mission capable rate has steadily dropped since 2015 to a troublesome 60 percent in 2017. Meanwhile the C-17 continues to be a workhorse with an 84 percent mission capable rate, which is among the highest in the entire fleet. Although the Air Force is working to replace at least the missile silo tender and security helicopter part of its aging UH-1N Twin Huey force, the aircraft still have an outstanding mission capable rate of 84 percent. T-1A Jayhawk, USAF The Air Force Training Command’s T-1 trainer fleet, which isn’t disappearing anything soon , has an abysmal 56 percent mission capable rate. That is breathtakingly low considering it is essentially a modified version of the Hawker/Beechcraft 400A business jet, which has a good reputation for reliability.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 20, 2018",Learjet And Airbus Had Strange Encounter With Mysterious Craft Over Arizona,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A series of strange events occurred high up in the flightlevels above Southern Arizona on February 24th, 2018. Between roughly 3:30pm and 4:15pm local time, N71PG , a Learjet 36 belonging to Phoenix Air , and American Airlines Flight 1095, an Airbus A321, had independent close encounters with a strange craft flying at around 40,000 feet. The planes were flying east at about 37,000 feet between the Sonoran Desert National Monument and the New Mexico border when the incident took place.Â The War Zone has obtained an official audio recording directly from the FAA of Albuquerque Center air traffic control talking to the pilots and other aircraft in their vicinity as the bizarre incident unfolded. Here it is in its unedited form: The initial report came from N71PG, the Learjet, asking Albuquerque Center if traffic had passed above them. The controller replied “negative,” meaning that there was no traffic to his knowledge that would account for such an observation. The Learjet pilot replies defiantly, “somethin’ did.” Another pilot chimed in on the frequency saying “a UFO” and the Learjet pilot replied “yeah.”Â A few minutes later, the controller asks American 1095 to let him know if they see anything “pass over you here in the next 15 miles.” The American Airlines pilot replies in a puzzled manner “if anything passes over us !?” The controller responds “affirmative, we had an aircraft in front of you at 37 [thousand feet] that reported something pass over him and we didn’t have any [radar] targets, so just let me know if you see anything pass over you.” At this point things get even more interesting as the Learjet pilot chimes in saying “I don’t know what it was, it wasn’t an airplane but it was–the path was going in the opposite direction.” A minute later American 1095 calls back in saying “yeah something just passed over us, like a–I don’t know what it was, but it was at least two-three thousand feet above us. Yeah it passed right over the top of us.” The controller calmly acknowledges the pilot’s report and says nothing else.Â An American Airlines A321 like the one involved in the incident. , Alan Wilson/Wikicommons Then a moment later the controller asks American 1095 “Could you tell if it was in motion or if it was just hovering?” The Airbus pilot quickly replies “I couldn’t make it out if it was a balloon or whatnot, but it was just really beaming light or had a big reflection and several thousand feet above us going the opposite direction.” The controller confirms the report by just saying “roger.”Â Shortly after that communiquÃ© a pilot asks on the frequency “was it a Google balloon ?” To which AAL1095 responds in a troubled tone “Doubtful.” Another voice then comes on the frequency saying “a UFO!”Â The whole event, at least as we understand it at this point in time, lasted about six minutes.Â According to an FAA representative who was incredibly helpful and forthcoming during our preliminary investigation, he didn’t think the incident was written up and noted that the supervisor at Albuquerque Center didn’t even know about it when queried. That does seem somewhat odd considering some sort of unidentified craft was flying along highly trafficked air routes at jet altitudes that didn’t have a transponder, did not appear on radar, and was not communicating with air traffic control.Â Top image is N71PG’s location at 3:47pm local time, the bottom is AAL1095’s location at that same time to give you an idea of the spacing between the two aircraft as they flew east over Arizona. , Flightradar24 The incident comes after a bizarre and remarkably well documented series of encounters with a mystery aircraft flying at a similar altitude occurred over Oregon and Northern California last Octoberâ€” a story which The War Zone broke and has just posted an in-depth update on. In that prolonged event, USAF F-15s were scrambled to investigate and the response from both the FAA and the military was extensive on multiple levels.Â We do have to note that the region in which this incident took place is very well known for being highly active with military aircraft, and even possibly clandestine aircraft that remain under a cloak of secrecy. To the east is White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force base. To the south is Tucson, where throngs of military aircraft operate out of two major basesâ€”Davis Monthan AFB and Tucson International Airport. To the North is Phoenix and Luke AFB which is a major training installation for F-35 and F-16 pilots. To the west are MCAS Yuma and the elaborate range complexes that surround it.Â To the south is also Fort Huachuca, which is the home of multiple unmanned aircraft units, including one belonging to the Army Special Operations Command (MQ-1Cs Gray Eagles and who knows what else) and the U.S. Border Patrol (RQ-9 Reapers), not to mention it is also a major training station for the Army’s RQ-7 Shadow drone operators. Then there is all the transient military traffic that visits the area for training and exercises. Suffice to say it is a hotspot of military aviation and is thought to also be somewhat of a corridor for clandestine aircraft as well. But none of that directly explains why an aircraft would be traveling totally unannounced to air traffic control in broad daylight right over the tops of airliners. And no story of a rogue drone or a military aircraft with malfunctioning communications surfaced with the FAA after the incident, at least to our knowledge.Â It is also worth mentioning, although it will surely draw the ire of some, that weather balloons do get launched into the upper atmosphere regularly all over the United States, and the regulations surrounding their operations don’t necessarily mandate the launching party contact the FAA or provide a radar reflector or a transponder.Â A U.S. Navy Aerographer’s Mate about to release a weather balloon. , USN You can read about these regulations here , and they will probably be surprising to many as a six pound radiosonde, camera, or other device slamming onto a jet’s windscreen at 500mph seems like a threat to public safety. But the fact is these scientific devices are launched on a daily basis around the globe without incident.Â That doesn’t mean they can’t come close to airliners. There are plenty of videos on the internet of them filming jets buzzing by that are pretty unsettling (make sure to turn the sound on for the video below).Â Weather balloon activity over Arizona has a uniquely interesting history as of late. One guy found what appears to be a radiosonde of Russian origin while hunting in the Sawtooth Mountains, which are located right around where the February 24th incident took place. The mysterious find is detailed in this article . During the summer when the notorious heat hits the Arizona desert, weather balloon activity usually increases dramatically. There are also other advanced balloon developments in the area as well, but they aren’t likely to go unreported or untracked.Â But even with these possibilities in mind, the pilots don’t sound that convinced that the object they saw was simply a balloon passing by, and there seems to have been some sort of combined closure rate involved as well. We have filed a Freedom Of Information Act request for any additional information related to this mysterious event and will report back to you when we have more details to share. In the meantime it will remain yet another mysterious aerial event in the skies over the American Southwest.Â What do you think it was?

Tyler Rogoway,"Posted on Apr 27, 2018","Accepting Kim Jong Un’s Invitation Was The Right Move, Now Get Realistic About A Deal","The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Following the South Korean delegation’s groundbreaking dinner meeting with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last week, it was clear that the North Korean premier is now pushing forward with an entirely new strategy when it comes to engaging diplomatically with the South and the United States. The supposed letter that South Korea subsequently rushed in person to the Washington, DC was an invite from Kim to meet directly with Donald Trump to discuss the nuclear standoff situation. Trump not only agreed to the invitation, but he said the meeting needs to happen no later than May. The whole affair signals a monumental and high-stakes shift in U.S. foreign policy in regards to North Korea. The announcement that Trump would to meet with Kim Jong Un was a strange one as it was made by South Korean officials on the White House lawn after sundown. Trump made an ultra rare surprise visit to the White House press briefing room letting reporters know something was in the works, and reports state that the Pentagon was taken by surprise by the proclamation. Also missing from the whole affair was America’s top diplomat Rex Tillerson. It’s abundantly clear that the extreme sanctions placed on North Korea, and a chilling in Pyongyang-Beijing relations, are seriously impacting the country and its economy. The regime will begin to suffer more dramatically in the coming months if something doesn’t change. And that is clearly the genesis of this change in attitude by the North, and so far the Kim regime has tightly controlled this new course of action that South Korea and now the U.S. are eagerly willing to participate in. This was not the case just a month ago when it was still stated that multiple preconditions would have to be met in order for the U.S. to engage directly at all with North Korea. South Korean delegation dines with Kim Jong Un on March 5th, 2018., AP Kim Jong Un knows that Trump can be swayed heavily by in-person contact and flattery, and that he isn’t bothered by brushing shoulders with dictators. Kim’s advisors have watched how Trump demonized China for years only to become best buddies with Xi Jinping and drastically ratcheting down the rhetoric towards Beijing as a result. With a nuclear arsenal already assured, not to mention a nearly complete long-range delivery system, the timing is right for Kim to try make some sort of deal, or at the very least prolong his timetable to better fortify his missile capabilities while also realizing some relief from crushing sanctions. Kim also knows that South Korean President Moon Jae-In is a unique partner after he has rebuffed U.S. concerns about bilateral talks with North Korea in hopes of deescalating the military standoff. But above all else, Kim is set to get what his father always wished for, direct talks with the U.S. at the highest levels, and recognition on a peer level by the world’s only superpower. But don’t be fooled by a simple invitation and deflated rhetoric, North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal. As we have discussed many times over, a freeze on nuclear weapons and missile development may be possible, but the idea that Trump’s presence would result in North Korea freely releasing what it has spent decades and countless resources developing—and what the regime sees as its primary insurance policy and only real bargaining card, is a laughably naive proposition. Chung Eui Yong, head of the South Korean presidential National Security Office, says at the White House in Washington on March 8, 2018 that U.S. President Donald Trump would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by May., AP But regardless of these issues, President Trump needs to be applauded for seizing on this opportunity and leading from the front when it comes to negotiating with one of America’s most vicious and long-standing enemies. For years I have written how the U.S. needs to drop the failing strategy of decades past and engage directly with North Korea on the highest levels. I have praised Donald Trump time and again for stating that he is willing to talk to Kim Jong Un one-on-one. I wrote the following in May of 2016: “The fact of the matter is that the North Koreans have had one major ask over the last decade-and-a-half of fragmented negotiations: unilateral negotiations with the United States, which they still ask for today. The US has been absolutely steadfast in not granting this single request, and it’s infuriated the North Koreans. Sure, old-school diplomatic insiders and traditional pundits will say that doing so will simply elevate the North Korean regime and lend legitimacy to Kim Jong Un’s rule. Well, guess what? Kim Jong Un is the ruler of North Korea whether you like it or not, and considering that we’ve talked to other dictators in the past, and have even subsidized their power structure , why is talking to Kim Jong Un any different? Above all, the long-standing policy toward North Korea has been a therapeutic solution at best. Now that the North Korean state is racing towards long-range nuclear ballistic missile capability and miniaturizing its nuclear warheads, the time for a change in our diplomatic strategy has clearly come. Simply sitting down with Kim Jong Un, or at least having high-level unilateral negotiations with officials from both sides, will change the game and will at the very least allow us to see if this new approach is capable of being effective or not. Going into the room with an incredibly strong package—including energy and food resources, a structured plan to open up the North Korean economy to foreign investment, illustrating what the lifting of harsh sanctions will look like for the North Koreans, and a route for normalization and reconciliation with South Korea—will provide the best shot at ending 60 years of bitter and dangerous tension. In addition, China and other nations can be a major part of this opportunity, but the US has to lead it and a President should deliver it. Doing so will mark an unprecedented and powerful diplomatic gesture, one that North Korea will know they won’t likely ever get again. If such an effort fails miserably, what’s lost? Nothing tangible. The North Koreans will spin their state-level propaganda any way they want, regardless of the outcome. They do it every day. The US will look like it’s serious about peace on the world stage, and is willing to do anything it can to see the tension on the Korean Peninsula come to an amicable end. For those who think it will embarrass the United States, I ask how so? If we come ready to make a deal and North Korea clearly does not, we would then be more certain of their intentions than ever, and could adjust our foreign policy and military footprint accordingly. It’s not as if the world community thinks highly of North Korea as it is; if they decided to walk away, or not show up at all, they would just go back to being the dangerous, clown-like regime they were before.” In addition to taking the bold first steps to involve itself in such an exotic diplomatic initiative, the U.S. must be realistic about what it can actually achieve in a deal and what would come next if a deal can’t be reached. Putting together a package that would drastically decrease tensions on the Korean Peninsula while also bringing North Korea into the international community—a beachhead of diplomacy if you will—that would have an architecture of carrots and sticks in which North Korea could change with dignity over time is absolutely key. Blatantly playing extreme hardball by saying ‘give up your nukes or it’s war’ will likely end progress before it even starts, or worse. But if you have read Art Of The Deal , Trump’s business negotiating style is exactly this. Kim’s calculation that he can woo Trump with flattering and pomp and circumstance is likely a well calculated one, but maybe that’s not such a bad thing either as it could allow the President to moderate his extreme demands in exchange for getting diplomatic momentum moving in a positive direction. Yet the real pitfall here is in North Korea’s true intentions and its long-history of not abiding by any comprehensive deals it has agreed to in past. The meeting will be seen as a breakthrough by some and as a giant step in the wrong direction by others. , AP But Kim Jong Un is not his farther. He has been startlingly forthcoming and accurate about his nuclear and missile programs. Maybe he wouldn’t mind a more stable situation either at this point. But once again, freezing testing and manufacturing of missiles and nuclear warheads is far cry from giving them up altogether. Any deal at all would have to include invasive inspections and verification protocols, something that reclusive North Korea has reneged on in the past. There are also the questions of military posture, including the status of forces along the DMZ, and especially America’s conventional forces footprint in South Korea, that will likely have to be addressed as well. In other words, there is no ‘simple agreement’ here, any deal short of total capitulation will be convoluted and full of its own roadblocks and pitfalls. Still, this engagement will notionally provide diplomats with a chance to ask what would it take for North Korea to denuclearize. If they are willing to respond to that at all, even if the response is totally outlandish, it will at least give a better indication of if the regime see such an outcome as possible under any circumstances at all. With all these challenges in mind, the Trump Administration will have to get its messaging straight and its peace offering structure down ironclad. Seeing as organization on this level is an area that the White House has struggled with in the past, and considering that the meeting is already rapidly approaching, the whittled down diplomatic corps will have to work in overdrive to ready itself for such a crucial and monumental geopolitical event. There may be only one shot at this so polishing the details to a spit shine and having everyone on the same page will be absolutely crucial when it comes to realizing any real success. Donald Trump himself will have to know his product much better than he has in past congressional dealings. Charm alone won’t change the course of history with the North Koreans. Trump says he is great friends with China’s newly minted forever ruler Xi Jinping., AP Regardless of the challenges ahead or even how this turns out, at least we are going to get a much better idea of North Korea’s level of tolerance for real change. And such a truth can be scary indeed as a negative outcome from the talks could push both sides closer to a terrible conflict. But fear of the truth is no reason not to engage with one-another directly. As it sits now, the alternative to doing so seems to be far from ideal, anyways. As for the pundits who say this is happening too fast, and that there should be talks about setting up high-level talks, they are totally missing the point. Those traditional forms of foreign relations have not gotten us anywhere with North Korea. If they want to move fast than rise to their challenge and execute with our best foot forward. If nothing else, you have the weight of the President himself behind this diplomatic excursion, so the North Koreans will know that they can’t play low-level diplomatic shell games as they have done for so many years. In the end we can only hope that something good can come out of this, and if it ends up being a fruitless affair, at least we know we tried.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jan 24, 2019",Congressman Details Integration Issues With The B-21’s Exotic Air Inlet Design,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Representative Rob Wittman (R-Va), a powerful member of the House Armed Services Committee, talked in an unprecedentedly open nature about the shadowy B-21 Raider program during a defense conference in Washington, DC. In his remarks he described the program as largely on track, but did detail a couple notable issues, one in particular having to do with the aircraft’s stealthy air inlet system and engine and exhaust configuration. He also noted that an “Iron Bird,” basically a non-flying, full-scale, systems configuration model of the aircraft, was being made to ease component integration issues. Defense News’s Aaron Mehta and Valerie Insinna published the initial report about Wittman’s remarks in which he described a few of the ‘hiccups’ associated with the bomber’s accelerated development, almost all of which remains deeply classified. The development cost alone for the aircraft is slated to run over $20B, with the program cost to build at least 100 of the bombers projected to cost upwards of $100B. Representative Rob Wittman is the chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee., AP As for the aircraft’s ‘hiccups,’ Wittman noted to reporters: “This is an extraordinary, complex aircraft… The issue is not that you have these uncertainties. The issue is how you address them.” But powerplant integration and airflow issues seem to be particularly vexing for the program judging by the Congressman’s remarks: “This is a very, very different design as far as airflow, and there have been some design challenges there… Pratt and Whitney says one thing; if the exhaust, the ducting contractor says another thing and says, ‘There’s only so much air we can move through there,’ and Pratt & Whitney says, ‘No, we need a certain amount of air to go through the front of the engine,’ then the question is, how do you do that?… Do you split [the requirements] between the two? Does Pratt & Whitney say, ‘Well, we can change some of the cowling on the surface face there to be able to do that’… It’s not just the engine, but it’s the ducting on the engine, too. I think all those things are elements that you would normally expect in an aircraft that’s new, that takes a concept from B-2, refines and uses it on this platform.” Wittman was also fully aware that messing with the B-21’s inlet design could have a major impact on its low-observability, and he is very much right for elevating those concerns. The inlet design of a low observable aircraft is among its most finely tuned and critical features. A jet aircraft’s radar cross section is largely impacted by its ability to conceal the fan blades of its jet engines from radar waves. At the same time ‘burying’ jet engines deep behind a complex duct system is not conducive to allowing for the consistent and massive volume of airflow needed to produce high and reliable thrust. The F-35 uses a ‘Y’ shaped inlet to completely hide the F135 turbofan’s first stage from line of sight. The bumps you see are part of its Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI) design which solves boundary air layer separation issues through its bulbous shape. You can read more about this concept here .  , Lockheed Martin Even the use of serpentine ducts that conceal a jet engine’s fan face from line-of-sight are also usually accompanied by other hidden low observable features. These can include baffles mounted directly in front of the engine’s face, radar disruptive structures installed under the intake’s skin, and radar absorbent coatings surrounding and lining the intake itself. Issues with stealthy aircraft designs and airflow to their jet engines are nothing new. In fact it dates back to the dawn of stealth , and Northrop’s own progenitor to the B-2— Tacit Blue (aka The Whale)—had major issues even starting due to its dorsal shared inlet design and twin engine configuration. Tacit Blue featured a recessed dorsal inlet that housed two engines side-by-side. , Northrop The B-21’s design is supposedly optimized for broadband stealth from virtually all directions—more so than its B-2 forebear that gave up some low-observability, as well as altitude performance, for a capability it has never used. Fielding the most low-observable engine configuration, to include a stealth optimized inlet and exhaust, is surely a key element of the program, but we know very little about any of it. We have had good indications for some time that B-21 will likely utilize two engines instead of the B-2’s four. A non-afterburning and tweaked variant of Pratt and Whitney’s F135 turbofan found on the F-35 fighter is rumored to be the powerplant of choice. That engine, without major tweaks that will surely be made for use on the B-21, puts out 28,000lbs of ‘dry’ thrust (without afterburner). With modifications, this number would likely climb into the 30,000lb+ thrust category. In comparison, the B-2A has four General Electric F118 engines that put out 17,300lbs of thrust each. The B-21 will almost certainly be a smaller design, with a payload of about two thirds to half that of the B-2. Thus the twin-engine design with a pair of roughly 30,000lb thrust class powerplants makes some sense. But regardless of who makes the engines for the B-21, or even if it has two engines instead of four, without a good inlet design that can deliver optimum airflow to the air thirsty engines during various phases of flight, their thrust ratings as advertised will plummet significantly. This can impact range, ceiling, and especially takeoff performance. This photo offers a great look at the B-2’s complex low observable inlet design which blocks line of sight to the engine face aside from certain elevated angles from the forward hemisphere. Notice how the stealthy intake still features a splitter plane for separating boundary layer air from the fuselage., USAF From the only concept art we have showing the B-21 the inlet design, it looks to be more seamlessly streamlined and integrated in the aircraft’s upper fuselage, as opposed to the B-2’s design which uses s-like ducts housed in protruding dome-like inlets to feed air to its engines. If the B-21’s inlet is as flush as it looks in the concept art, managing boundary layer airflow will also be an issue and could impact airflow as well. Clearly de-conflicting inlet configuration and airflow management for such an exotic design would be challenging, but we will have to wait to see just how much of a preference ends up being put on this feature, especially if an extremely low-observable inlet design starts eating into hard performance requirements severely, one of which is very likely a high operating altitude of around 60,000 feet or more. The B-21’s exhaust is a total mystery. We have no idea what it will look like, but it’s totally possible that the twin planar type exhausts found on the B-2 will be a thing of the past. Ducting the exhaust out of a larger portion of the bomber’s upper trailing edge is a possibility, not just to drastically reduce the aircraft’s infrared signature but to also provide better stability during engine-out conditions. Going from four engines to two would complicate scenarios where an engine has to be shut down in flight, especially for a flying wing design with very limited longitudinal stability as it is. It is also possible that the exhausts from both engines will be ducted towards the centerline of the B-21’s “V” shaped tail, mitigating engine-out controllability issue to a large degree. The main point here is that powerplant integration on a very low-observable and exotic aircraft is a very big issue, but at the same time it is hardly unforeseeable that problems would arise in this department considering what we know about the program’s ambitions. Wittman also mentioned that the aircraft’s wing design is something of an roadblock, but we don’t really have any details as to why. We have posited that one “bleeding edge” stealth technology that could potentially be incorporated into the B-21’s design is so called “morphing wing” technology . If this concept is being used to any degree it would drastically complicate the wing design and fabrication process, but the low-observable payoff could be significant. Wittman also mentioned that Northrop Grumman is having issues stacking enough engineers onto the program to keep up with its ambitious timeline, which really isn’t a surprise. Beyond propulsion, bringing in all the subcontractors together to participate efficiently in building out the bomber is also a challenge. The Congressman noted that Northrop Grumman is working on that aforementioned “Iron Bird” full-scale mock up to better stave off major systems integration issues. This is clearly more information on the B-21’s development than we have ever gotten before, and the fact that it is coming from a Congressman and not the USAF or even Northrop Grumman seems very odd. Also the implied timeline conflicts somewhat with recent comments made by the 412th Test Wing commander, who noted just last week that testing will begin of the B-21 at Edwards AFB in the near future. We don’t know exactly what that means, but it seems that the program would need a flying example of the aircraft within the next 24 months or so to have any hope of staying on track developmentally speaking. Then again it’s also very possible that the congressman could have been referring to issues in the past that he has been briefed on, we just don’t know. The USAF is counting on the B-21 reaching initial operating capability by roughly 2025, at which time it will begin replacing B-2s and B-1Bs that together currently makeup the majority of the USAF’s bomber fleet.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 1, 2019",American Destroyer Packed New Electronic Warfare System During Black Sea Mission,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney (DDG-64) made a two week visit to the tense Black Sea region recently alongside USS Ross (DDG-71), with the mission wrapping up in recent days. It was the first time that two American surface combatants were patrolling the largely enclosed body of water since Exercise Sea Breeze 2017 that occurred last July. One of the vessels, USS Carney , was photographed sporting a new piece of advanced hardware as it transited the Bosphorus Strait —the latest “Block II” configuration of the U.S. Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SWIP). There are many versions of the AN/SLQ-32 (“Slick 32”), a system which has been in service in one form or another for nearly 40 years. It is not only an integral and critical part of ship’s combat system and defenses but it is also a major node in America’s sprawling electronic intelligence gather apparatus which keeps tabs on potential enemies’ electronic order of battle through myriad of platforms and weapon systems . Just some of the traditional assets used to keep tabs on enemy emissions and their emitter locations., USN brief available here . Later and more elaborate variants of the AN/SLQ-32, like the AN/SLQ-32V5, even include active jammers arrayed around the ship—a peripheral system largely known by its nickname “Sidekick.” This gives the vessel extended 360 degree jamming capability and is meant to counter the growing threat of ever more complex anti-ship missile systems proliferating around the globe. AN/ASQ-32(V5), USN brief available here . The new Block II variant of the system introduces the beginning of a whole new level of hardware and expanded capabilities. Instead of the old “Slick 32” enclosure that features a hodgepodge of sensor and jamming arrays, the new system (AN/SLQ-32V6) uses a unified array that is far more capable when it comes to geolocating (interferometry), identifying, and classifying threats. It also leverages an enhanced back-end control system that is tied into the ship’s combat system and defenses—namely its decoy control system—as well networked with other external assets. The domain of U.S. Navy electronic warfare is a shadowy one, and even conceptual publication of details surrounding these systems and the hardware they are based on is somewhat limited. But Joe Ottaviano, Lockheed Martin’s SEWIP program director, stated the following about the enhanced system: “This latest Block 2 upgrade will ensure the AN/SLQ-32 system allows the system to continue to outpace the  threat and establishes a framework to easily install future upgrades… Preliminary results from the ships testing have been very exciting and exceeding our expectations. The system is providing detection capabilities that allow the warfighter to see the enemy before being seen.” SEWIP Block II mounting locations., Lockheed Martin The next major leap in SEWIP capability will come in the form of the SEWIP Block III, which will build on Block II’s advanced passive detection abilities by introducing a high-end electronic attack capability as well as other ancillary functions, including possibly long-range, high-bandwidth communications using a new active electronically scanned array (AESA) emitter. In other words, Block III will add to Block II’s hardware to give American surface combatants an independent, high-end electronic warfare capacity, which will allow the unified system to not only detect, geolocate and classify potential threats at long ranges, but also actively deceive or even destroy those threats using advanced “soft kill” tactics. There are multiple versions (V) of previous block AN/SLQ-32 systems in use, including enclosures that include jammers (bottom arrays) and those that do not (below). , Yasu Osugi/wikicommons SEWIP Block II includes a whole new and simplified array enclosure which gets rid of the busier looking, classic “SLICK 32” installation that comes in various sensor/emitter configurations. The one above, which doesn’t include jammers, was pictured mounted on USS Gridley (DDG-101)., USN We are not simply talking about old-school jamming here. AESA arrays have a secondary electronic attack capability that goes beyond traditional forms of confusing or blinding an enemy’s radar or communications system. They can potentially fire powerful pinpoint beams of RF energy that can cause physical damage to targeted radar components and especially the sensitive radar seeker heads mounted on many anti-ship missiles. Other targets for such a system can include drones or even enemy aircraft and ships within the system’s effective range, which would be extensive. Using the system against enemy communications nodes is also a possibility. By its very nature it could also perform other more traditional radar functions and may end up being a backup for a ship’s primary combat radar system. Because AESA arrays are so agile and precise, they can execute multiple functions at one time and could provide multiple forms of electronic attack against multiple targets simultaneously. Such a capability represents a massive leap in protection for American fighting ships, and also gives vessels a new offensive magazine to draw upon in some scenarios. With all this in mind, if SEWIP block II is a ship’s electronic ears, SEWIP Block III will be its electronic fists. SWEIP Block III array will provide high-end electronic attack capabilities to SWIP Block II., Raytheon Retired Navy commander Bryan Clark, now with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, told Breakingdefense.com the following about SEWIP Block III’s capabilities. “SEWIP Block 3 brings active electronic attack across a wider frequency range…with digital processing that will facilitate new ‘intelligent’ EW processing that will enable the system to react to signals it has never seen before… SEWIP Block 3’s AESA array enables it to be a passive sensor, communication array, or a radar… It could also confuse or obscure aircraft and ship radars as part of the Navy’s new electromagnetic maneuver warfare concept.” These systems will be increasingly networked among other vessels and assets that are part of any American naval armada. The evolving SEWIP roadmap also includes distributing pieces of the surface-fleet’s electronic warfare and electronic surveillance apparatus off-vessel as well. The integration of an Advanced Offboard Electronic Warfare (AOEW) pod system to be flown aboard MH-60 Seahawk helicopters would allow AN/SLQ-32 architecture to obtain data from areas far over the horizon that are inaccessible to shipboard systems. According to Defensesystems.com , Joe Ottaviano, Director of Electronic Warfare at Lockheed Martin said the following about the AOEW pod system: “The pod gives you additional reach-back capability. You get a look well over the horizon that will be communicated back to the ship. Depending on what the solution is, you could actually decide to provide some type of response. You can see the adversary well before he can see anything in the fleet.” USN brief available here . The Marines in particular have been very aggressive about fielding podded electronic surveillance and electronic warfare systems on various platforms, usually referred to as Intrepid Tiger II . But those systems weren’t designed to be integrated directly with SEWIP. With SEWIP Block III now in development, SEWIP Block IV will supposedly include electro-optical and infrared capabilities for long-range identification and targeting. This will probably include a staring distributed aperture system for close to medium range detection, tracking, and situational awareness, as well as longer-ranged systems for target discrimination and targeting, like upgraded versions Mk 20 electro-optical sensor system currently fielded on American destroyers and cruisers. These systems could be especially useful when trying to detect and counter low-observable (stealthy) missiles and drones that use passive homing techniques like imaging infrared, and thus give off no RF emissions to home in on. Although USS Carney is far from the newest destroyer in America’s inventory, it’s is no mystery why it was prioritized to receive such an upgrade. Alongside her three sister ships forward deployed to Rota, Spain, they find themselves operating independently in some of the globe’s nastiest areas with little support— namely the Black Sea . This body of water is dominated by Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and would become a super anti-ship missile engagement zone should hostilities erupt. Based in the region, Russia has aircraft tasked with chucking anti-ship missiles, shoreline cruise missile defenses, and dozens of ships, from small corvettes to destroyers, bristling with anti-ship missiles both new and old. As such, the U.S. Navy vessels tasked with regularly operating in this area have received fast-tracked defensive upgrades. These upgrades include the installation of a Mk15 Phalanx close-in weapon system forward and a SeaRAM self-contained Rolling Airframe Missile launcher aft. You can read more about this unique configuration here . With the severity of the potential threat in mind, it makes sense why USS Carney, and likely the ship’s pier-mates will be on the leading edge of the latest electronic warfare and other defensive upgrades available now, and in the foreseeable future. Don’t expect the Navy to slow down anytime soon on evolving shipboard electronic warfare systems or enhanced close-in defenses. Quite the contrary. It has already been announced that the service will be fielding operational defensive laser systems in the near term as well as laser dazzlers that can blind unmanned vehicle and missiles optical sensors. But these directed energy systems alone won’t stop the threat of large barrages of advanced cruise missiles or even a swarming attack by small drones . The latter of which may not be able to sink a vessel, but it could result in a “mission kill” by taking out a fighting ship’s sensors and other key components. USN brief available here As it sits now, a “cocktail approach” is being quickly expanded on in an attempt to counter these increasingly varied threats to American surface combatants. From kinetic options in the form of new multi-million dollar long-range missiles , to upgraded rapid-reacting medium range missile systems, to new types of close-in defenses, the Navy is moving quick to bolster its naval defenses. But “soft kill” systems like SEWIP Block III provide an indispensable, and maybe the most realistic way of enhancing a ship’s survivability against a major attack as it can react instantly in every direction, in multiple ways, and it is not limited by magazine depth. USS Carney , USN Considering the rapid pacing on maritime threats around the globe, and especially those posed by rising peer-state competitors, don’t be surprised if the Navy is already on its way to developing SEWIP Block V within just a handful of years. But in the meantime, SEWIP Block II has now been deployed into Russia’s backyard, giving the Navy a much sharper ability to detect, locate, classify, and monitor regional emissions and, if necessary, an enhanced ability to react in the best way possible defensively should an attack occur.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 29, 2018",B-21 Raider Officially Heading To Edwards Air Force Base For Testing,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been endless speculation over the past five years as to where America’s next stealth bomber would be tested and when. That conjecture was officially put to rest during a fairly obscure regional business conference attended by Brigadier General Carl Schaefer, the boss of the expansive 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base. During his remarks he made it clear that B-21’s testing home would be Edwards Air Force Base, and that the stealth bomber will be heading there sooner than some may have speculated. In his address made on March 3rd, 2018 at the Antelope Valley Board of Trade and Business Outlook Conference, which was covered closely by the Antelope Valley Press , General Schaefer made the B-21’s future basing crystal clear once and for all: “For the first time ever, I would like to publicly announce that the B-21 will be tested at Edwards Air Force Base… Edwards has been the home of bomber test and now we also can publicly release that the B-21 is coming to Edwards and we will be testing it here in the near future.” Shaefer went on to say that team Edwards will ramp up its push to ready infrastructure and personnel needed to support the B-21 test initiative, both on the ground and in the air. It has been a couple years since the USAF circulated this cryptic concept art of the B-21 and we haven’t seen any additional visuals since. , USAF The last time I was at Edwards, roughly five years ago, it was clear that the South Base installation was undergoing a major transition. The USAF’s B-52 and B-1 bomber test units had relocated to the expansive primary apron and South Base had been vacated, aside from the B-2 test unit, so that it could be prepared for a shadowy new program. Not long after my visit similar rumors began to permeate throughout military aviation community—something big was coming to South Base, and it was probably the yet to be named B-21 Raider, previously referred to as the Long-Range Strike Bomber, or LRS-B. It was possible that it could eventually be accompanied by a “family” of new systems that were supposedly in the works clandestinely to gain an upper hand on peer state competitors that had been closing the qualitative gap with the U.S. in recent years. 1 Jul 1997 at Edwards – Upon the completion of the B-2 Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase, the Air Force Flight Test Center assumed control and security responsibilities for the B-2 compound at South Base. (File photo dated May 2000), USAF/Edwards AFB PAO Fast forward half a decade and that bomber, now fully named but still highly classified, is moving toward a grand unveiling and the beginning of a formal flight test program. And there is no place on earth with more experience or the unique capabilities needed to support such an endeavor than Edwards AFB. The sprawling Edwards South Base complex offers additional security and unique facilities for high-end strategic programs. It has housed the B-2 program, ongoing test programs for the B-52 and B-1B, and the Airborne Laser program, among other initiatives. Aside from the B-2 test program occupying the smaller, low-slung hangar to the southeast of the massive hangar facility, it has become vacated, at least officially, in preparation for a new high-technology aircraft program., Google Earth Still, some pundits have tried to align virtually anything going on at Area 51 with the new bomber, even though there is no indication that the highly secretive locale is its intended primary flight test destination. We have a good idea that past technology demonstrators and other assets associated with the bomber program’s genesis likely flew out of there, but for the B-21, “The Ranch” is only likely to be a temporary destination for some testing purposes, just as it was for the B-2 Spirit. Such a testing effort will not be transient in nature, either. Beyond primary flight testing and eventually moving the new bomber into an operational test and evaluation phase, with a minimum requirement of 100 Raiders, and considering that the aircraft will be far more capable and flexible than a traditional bomber, and will feature entirely new weapons as well, testing is likely to continue at the base for decades following the jet’s initial entry into service. The B-2 was highly active during the early part of its development and has remained active out of both Edwards AFB and Plant 42. , Northrop Grumman The B-21’s planned trials at Edwards Air Force Base is in addition to Northrop Grumman’s expansion of its facilities by a million square feet and its workforce by nearly 2,000 people at Plant 42 in Palmdale , California—located just 20 miles to the southwest of Edwards AFB. With the program likely to cost nearly $100B, and possibly much more if the USAF’s ends up buying additional units, the B-21 enterprise will be a massive boon for the local “flight test valley” economy. But the big takeaway here is not just that the B-21 will indeed execute its test program out of Edwards AFB, but that it will be rolling out of the shadows to do so soon, at least according to the 412th Test Wing’s boss. And this would make some sense timeline-wise as initial testing of pre-production airframes will likely take nearly half a decade before production can begin. This vibes with the basic timeline as we understand it, in which the B-21 will replace both the B-1B and B-2A in active service, an initiative that will start in the mid 2020s and roll through the middle part of the 2030s. B-2 makes triumphant very low altitude flyby of Northrop’s Plant 42 facility during the early 1990s., Facebook Gif Rollout of the new bomber, or visual disclosure in some meaningful manner beyond a very basic and detail-lacking piece of concept art, will be one of the biggest aviation and military technology stories of the decade. It’s exciting to think that we may be finally on the precipice of such an event. It’s worth noting that the 30th anniversary of the B-2 Spirit’s rollout will occur on November 22nd, 2018. That date surely presents an opportune time to do the same for the B-2’s successor and Northrop Grumman’s second shot at constructing a flying-wing stealth bomber. https://youtube.com/watch?v=YvjAcQdgvyU Considering how much the company and the USAF know now as compared to in 1988 , I don’t think anyone will be disappointed when the B-21 finally breaks its cover and takes up its throne as the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",The Emergency Slides On The UK’s New Aircraft Carrier Look Like Way Too Much Fun,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To say that there is a lot of hype surrounding the Royal Navy’s new carriers would be a vast understatement. But who can blame the Brits who have longed for a proper flattop since HMS Ark Royal was retired the better part of a decade ago. The Royal Navy knows their new carriers garner major interest so they been on a major social media offensive to let people see seemingly every step HMS Queen Elizabeth makes as it inches its way ever closer to initial operating capability. This week that process included testing the carrier’s Marine Evacuation System (MES) as part of a broader Safety Of Lives At Sea (SOLAS) trial. First off, not many people even know that ships can have evacuation slides like airliners, but these days many do! In this case, the system’s mission would be to get up to 1,600 souls that may inhabit the HMS Queen Elizabeth at any given time off the vessel as soon as possible without resorting to sailors and passengers jumping from up to 88 of feet in the air into the unforgiving water below—a drop that can cause serious injury or even death. In order to accomplish this task the Royal Navy ended up with the mother of evacuation slides, and at the bottom there is a landing area where people would be boarded onto life rafts during an ‘abandon ship’ or other major emergency scenario. HMS Queen Elizabeth’s system looks nearly identical to the one below, but Marine Evacuation Systems come in many shapes and sizes. This includes ones that have huge, enclosed, bouncy-house like life rafts at their ends and spiraling chutes that drop escapees near-vertically into the contraption. This helps solve the complex task of keeping the slides and landing areas clear, and the need to tightly coordinate the pacing rate that evacuees egress down the slide and board into separate life rafts. HMS Queen Elizabeth’s evacuation system appears to be manufactured by Liferaft Systems Australia which has a large defense arm. Apparently the design was conceived in 1992 and has been constantly evolving ever since. For high-end military users, the system’s housing is even designed for reduced radar signature. According to the company’s website , 600 people can be evacuated per half hour per system. So in HMS Queen Elizabeth case, it would theoretically take less than 30 minutes to evacuate her maximum complement using the three slides on her starboard side. She has another three slides on her port side as well. The landing area also acts as a large life raft that is fully equipped with supplies. Liferaft Systems Australia Liferaft Systems Australia also notes that the system can be used as waterline platform for humanitarian and other missions, stating: “More frequently naval ships are being used for humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts and exercises to assist ships affected by piracy. The ability to recover persons from the water rapidly is crucial… Medical personnel can go down the slide and immediately assess recovered casualties on the safe stable platform provided by the attached 50 or 100 person liferaft… Uniquely it is also possible to rescue stricken personnel from the water using LSA MES… Personnel can be recovered up the inclined slide using a simple ladder or mechanical winch.” So there you have it, the HMS Queen Elizabeth’s e-ticket ride of an emergency escape system. Hopefully her crew will never have to use it, but it sure is good to know that it’s there just in case.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Putin’s Air-Launched Hypersonic Weapon Appears To Be A Modified Iskander Ballistic Missile,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yesterday’s bizarrely ominous presentation by Russian Vladimir Putin, where he showcased six super weapons that will supposedly give Russia an asymmetric edge over its potential foes—namely the United States—is still reverberating throughout the national security community. After we posted our master recap of the event and the weapons concepts featured in it, we and our incredible discussion crew here at The War Zone went to work dissecting what was presented in an attempt to parse fact from fiction. One system in particular that Putin touted seems to share a peculiar level of commonality with one of Russia’s most prominent operational weapons —the Iskander short-range tactical ballistic missile. One of the weapons touted in Putin’s speech was an air-launched hypersonic anti-ship missile launched from the belly of a massive MiG-31 Foxhound . Upon closer examination, one of our commenters “Idunknown” noted that it looked exactly like an Iskander ballistic missile. We took a closer look and after doing a proportional/dimensional analysis of the missile in relation to the Foxhound we came to the same conclusion. In fact, the missile doesn’t even look that highly modified, although it’s exhaust fairing, which drops off during launch, throws off the Iskander’s signature profile a bit at first glance. Youtube Screengrab The Iskander and its newest variant, the Iskander-M, are not air breathing missiles. They use solid rocket fueled motors to propel them on their ballistic arcs. Yet Russia claims its new hypersonic missile has a flight profile like that of a cruise missile. All this begs the question is this missile actually an air-launched ballistic missile system? A Russian soldier assists in loading an Iskander-M ballistic missile onto its transporter-erector-launcher. , AP The Iskander missile is hypersonic by its very nature, but it doesn’t achieve that through a long flat flightpath. Supposedly this missile system is named the KH-47M2 Kinzhal, and Russia’s Aerospace Force Commander-in-Chief Sergei Surovikin described it to reporters following Putin’s address as such: “The Kinzhal system substantially boosts the capabilities of the Russian Aerospace Force to respond to any possible act of aggression against our country and along with other strategic weapon systems will help deter possible adversaries from rushing headlong into action… The fast-speed fixed-wing carrier allows delivering a missile with unique performance characteristics to the area of its discharge within minutes. The main propulsion unit mounted on the aero-ballistic missile accelerates a warhead to hypersonic speed within seconds. The missile’s maneuvering at speeds exceeding the speed of sound by several times allows it to reliably breach all air defense and anti-ballistic missile defense systems that exist or are being developed.” The general went on to say that the missile’s seeker allows it to strike targets during day and night and in all weather conditions. “All the test launches of the most advanced hypersonic aero-ballistic missiles that have been conducted have ended with the accurate destruction of the designated targets. From December 1st last year, the first aviation unit armed with the Kinzhal aircraft missile system switched to accomplishing experimental and combat duty missions to practice the fundamentals of its combat use.” Nothing the general says disqualifies this from being an air launched ballistic missile. In fact, some of what he says points directly at that possibility. During his address, Putin said the following when describing the super weapon: “The missile flies at hypersonic speed, 10 times greater than the speed of sound, it is maneuvering in all parts of the flight trajectory. This allows it to overcome all existing and, I think, future air-defense and missile-defense systems, delivering to the target nuclear and other warheads at a distance of more than 2,000 kilometers [1,250 miles].” The hard maneuvers shown in the computer generated footage appears much more like that of an anti-ship cruise missile than a ballistic missile. And some outlets have reported that the system uses an air-breathing ramjet engine for sustained cruise, not a rocket engine. But there is no evidence of this, and by all the imagery we have it looks like this is indeed an air-launched Iskander ballistic missile that may have some additional targeting capabilities, like being able to hit moving ships at sea. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IGX1mpW0hvo Anti-ship ballistic missiles are an emerging high-end anti-access/area-denial technology that China has dominated developmentally speaking. In fact, Beijing has already fielded medium-range and even possibly intermediate-range land-based variants of anti-ship ballistic missiles and is actively working on porting the capability over to airborne launch platforms. But for Russia, such a capability remains a vacant hole in their own long-range defensive order of battle. And beyond anti-ship capabilities, presumably the missile would also be able to hit fixed targets anywhere within its reach. Being able to quickly forward deploy and launch such a weapon via Russia’s heaviest tactical aircraft makes some sense. Not only does the MiG-31, which is traditionally an interceptor, possess long range, very high-speed, and updated avionics, but most importantly, it can launch the missile from extreme altitudes providing maximum potential range. An air-launched ballistic missile is a relevant capability that dramatically expends the reach (by roughly four times), deployability, and flexibility over existing Iskander missiles. But if this missile does indeed have anti-ship capabilities, that’s a huge leap in capability for Russia’s already incredibly dense anti-ship missile arsenal. According to Putin, the system is somewhat mature, and has already been deployed on experimental duty to airfields in Russia’s expansive Southern Military District. This development will likely only increase calls for broader, more layered ballistic missile defense , not to mention the fielding of new targeting new sensors , and the distributing of some “shooter” roles to airborne systems. This includes those armed with directed energy weapons (lasers) and even very-long range air-to-air missiles . The high probability that Russia has adapted their staple tactical ballistic missile system into an air-launched variant with expanded targeting capability is also a reminder that Moscow can make big and even credible capability claims by leveraging and adapting assets that they have already invested in heavily. Soldiers in training with the Iskander mobile short-range ballistic missile system at the guided missile brigade in the Southern Military District. , AP So for the critics who rightfully question the economic and technological feasibility of Putin’s proposed super weapon arsenal, it’s important not to bluntly classify all of these concepts as farcical or unrealistic. Clearly each of the systems Putin touted in his address are in different phases of their developmental timelines, and the full capabilities stated for each weapon may not be entirely accurate or could even be downright misleading, but some of these weapons are actually quite feasible, at least to a certain degree. With this in mind, and taking into account the recent history of many prominent analysts’—not to mention the U.S. intelligence apparatus as a whole—atrocious handicapping of China’s and North Korea’s weapons development abilities, we shouldn’t underestimate Russia or its super weapons ambitions.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jul 3, 2020",Watch This F-22 Raptor Execute A Mind-Blowing Inverted Somersault At Altitude,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Russia and its lineup of thrust vectoring fighters—namely modern Flanker derivatives like the Su-35 —have certainly stolen the show when it comes to displaying extreme slow-speed maneuverability and other post-stall aerobatic feats. But the F-22, with its high thrust-to-weight ratio, huge control surfaces, and especially its two-dimensional thrust vectoring, can holds its own in this regard as well. Case in point, this pretty damn amazing clip of an F-22 executing a big belly-first somersault at altitude. The jet seems to defy physics as its nose quickly changes from pointing one direction to the other. Although extreme low-speed maneuvering has limited utility in modern air combat, for the F-22 its ability to quickly turn the tables on its enemy at low-speed is more important than it would be otherwise due to the lack of specific equipment on the jet. Although the Raptor now fields the AIM-9X Sidewinder, it still lacks a helmet mounted sight to aim the missile at targets located far off the jet’s centerline axis. The next generation Sidewinder does have a wider field of view, longer detection range, and can still be cued to targets far off boresight by the F-22’s APG-77 AESA radar, but in hard maneuvering fights, the pilot still has to point the jet at the target to some degree in order to get the missile to lock on and thus kill the enemy. Most fighters currently in service, including Russia’s thrust vectoring types, have helmet mounted sights to aim their short-range air-to-air missiles. You can read all about these tactics and how they apply to various aircraft and scenarios in this previous piece , but suffice it to say, beyond one-versus one dogfights, ending up in a very low energy state is a bad place to be whether you vanquish an enemy fighter or not. Yet convoluted air combat environments with strict rules of engagement, like the one over Syria , remind us that within-visual-range air combat can’t be fully discounted. This is also true as a result of new tactics, electronic warfare systems, advanced missiles, and stealthy aircraft that are proliferating around the globe. Beyond that, in some cases F-22 pilots will need to use all their missiles, and no, the AIM-9X is not there for purely defensive purposes, nor is the gun. USAF Beyond the within-visual-range combat arena, the F-22’s thrust vectoring also helps it significantly with flight control at extreme altitudes and high-speeds. The Raptor community is known to hunt as high up as 60,000 feet and can supercruise (fly faster than the speed of sound for sustained periods without the use of gas-guzzling and easy to detect afterburner) at speeds greater than Mach 1.5. Regardless of one of the most contested subjects in modern warfare and the F-22’s high-altitude abilities, this video is just another reminder that the Raptor has a deep bag of tricks and it remains the gold standard of fighter aircraft the world over.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Aug 19, 2017",It Looks Like Javelin Anti-Tank Missiles Are Headed To Battlefield Ukraine,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nearly four years after Russia’s initial incursion into Ukrainian territory and the shadow war that sparked off in Eastern Ukraine shortly after, the U.S. State Department cleared Ukraine to purchase FGM-148 Javelin advanced anti-tank missiles. According to Defense News the $47M deal includes 210 Javelin missiles, 37 command launch units (CLU) and two spares, as well as training, logistics and support. This would be the first time the United States has agreed to provide advanced lethal weaponry to Ukraine since the conflict began. The Javelin, although known largely as an anti-tank missile packing a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round that can penetrate the latest armor, is really a multi-role shoulder-launched missile system capable of taking out everything from heavy armor, to troops hiding behind cover, to low and slow flying aircraft. Its reusable command launch unit can also be used independently as a thermal imaging surveillance system which can drastically improve austerely equipped troops’ ability to surveil their surroundings, especially at night. It features wide-angle viewing modes as well as a zoom mode up to 12X. The 50lb missile and CLU apparatus can be used against targets in two modes. The first is direct attack, the missile flies directly at its target in a relatively straight line. The other is a top-down attack, which is really useful for obliterating tanks where they are the least armored and for taking out enemy formations hiding behind cover. The missile is fire and forget, and will stay locked onto a moving vehicle autonomously as it makes its attack. The standard Javelin’s range is only about a mile and a half with the latest versions adding about a mile to that range. So even though it does provide a standoff capability to some degree, it may necessitate getting within range of enemy weapons in order to deploy it. But this is less of a limiting factor for combat in urban environments. Javelin capability doesn’t come cheap, though. Each Javelin missile runs roughly $80k, and the reusable Launch Control Units cost about double that. But especially for troops using older equipment, with only rudimentary air cover and night fighting abilities, the Javelin provides something of an asymmetric advantage, one that could be incredibly useful when it comes to targeting separatist vehicles and groups of fighters in Eastern Ukraine. https://youtube.com/watch?v=llzKYdjeSzQ While the world has largely turned its gaze to other conflicts, the fighting between government forces and Russian backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region has raged on with sporadic levels of intensity . The use of heavy armor has been banned from the fight according to various accords that have proven to be flimsy at best, engagements continue with these vehicles. Just recently a video showing Ukrainian troops taking out an armored fighting vehicle surfaced on the net. The weapon used was likely a guided anti-tank munition like the Ukrainian Skif and the vehicle was said to have been on a reconnaissance mission in violation of deescalation agreements. In the past, the U.S. has only allowed certain defensive systems, utility vehicles, and support supplies to be exported to Ukraine. This has included small drones , Humvees, counter-battery radars, and everything from bed rolls to medical supplies. Training has been the largest form of assistance the U.S. has offered the embattled country, and it has benefited from American intelligence and strategic reconnaissance support over the area as well. But as for sending any “offensive weaponry” Kiev’s way, that has been strictly banned. This has enraged some in congress who believe the U.S. should supply far more deadly weapons capabilities to Ukraine in an effort to counter Russian aggression, and even possibly a wholesale invasion of Eastern Ukraine. The Trump Administration has reviewed the Obama era policy and has decided to move forward with recommendations of arming the Ukraine government with more potent weapons, the FGM-148 being at the very top of the list. DOD This announcement comes as tensions between Moscow and Washington have skyrocketed in recent days. Just today Vladimir Putin gave an ominous, rhetoric-filled speech that showcased Russian weapons concepts that are claimed to be in developed and will supposedly make it impossible to stop a Russian nuclear attack on the United States. This came after America’s Nuclear Posture Review and overall future military strategy ordered a refocus on countering peer state competitors—chiefly Russia and China. These white papers included recommendations to the fielding new U.S. nuclear delivery systems as well, although none as exotic as those Putin touted as being under development in Russia. Ukrainian soldiers train with multi-national forces during Rapid Trident 2017., YURI DYACHYSHYN/AFP/Getty Images Congress now has to approve the sale, which should happen, before the weapons can begin arriving at Ukrainian Army units. We’ll have to wait to see what else the Trump Administration is willing to furnish Ukraine with when it comes to heavy arms, and most importantly, we will have to see how Russia treats this shift in policy. There is no doubt that Moscow will label it a major provocation, but just what military moves the Russians may make in response to it will have to be seen. The chances of something of a proxy arms race is possible, but until the missiles start being used we won’t know for sure what geopolitical impact their presence on the battlefield may have beyond a tactical one.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Mar 24, 2018",Strategic Command Boss Makes Case For Satellites Capable Of Tracking Hypersonic Vehicles,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. There has been a ton of hype over hypersonic weapons as of late, and ballistic missile defense has also become a far more popular topic as a result of North Korea’s missile programs . The ballistic missile defense system the U.S. already has in place is a rickety and unreliable one , made up of a hodgepodge of various sensors, data-links, and interceptors scattered around the globe. When it comes to hypersonics, the Pentagon is just coming to terms with the emerging threat posed by these super-fast flying weapons and is trying to figure out ways to detect and destroy them before they can land a deadly blow. But General John Hyten, the head honcho over at U.S. Strategic Command and the man who says the military’s inability to “go fast” keeps him up at night , has laid out his plans for confronting both threats in a far more robust manner, and possibly others in the process as well. In the video below shot by C4ISRnet.com at the Army Association’s Symposium on missile defense, Hyten outlines how improved sensors are becoming his main focus on tackling both threats. This underscores something The War Zone has been saying for some time, that it’s simply not feasible to provide enough persistent terrestrial radar coverage to support a robust ballistic missile “shield” yet along one optimized for also countering hypersonic vehicles. As such, Hyten wants to go to space to accomplish the critical mid-course discrimination element of the missile defense mission, and in doing so, also provide surveillance and tracking of hypersonic threats. Supposedly the Missile Defense Agency has a plan to do just that, but it is taking far too long. This system is called the Midcourse Tracking Sensor, which will be able to track the missile as it traverses through its midcourse stage of flight. This is often referred to as “cold body tracking” as there is no infrared plume or hot reentry vehicle to home in on quickly and decisively. This is also the regime of flight where decoys can be deployed and advanced countermeasures activated, which throw off radars and other terrestrial tracking sensors. Getting an interceptor in the vicinity of a missile during its midcourse stage of flight is hard enough , but making sure it actually takes out the warhead and not a decoy is a whole other problem that this system could help solve. But being able to detect and track ballistic missiles as they cruise towards their targets above the atmosphere is just one of this system’s possible uses. It could also be able to look down on earth and track hypersonic vehicles ripping through the atmosphere at thousands of miles an hour, and provide early warning and even critical telemetry to interceptors that could streak up and knock down these emerging threats. General Hyten addresses a space conference. , Matthew Staver/Bloomberg via Getty Images As Hyten notes, this system could change the game so to speak for adversaries who are developing high-end weapons to take advantage of the fact that America’s early warning and anti-missile capabilities are built around countering traditional ballistic missile flight profiles and concepts of operation. It’s very possible that such a system, with sensitive look-down radar capabilities as well as infrared tracking systems, could even be able to detect aircraft as well. America’s most high-tech space-based early warning systems, known as Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) , detects the plumes of missiles during their boost stage, and may even have limited cold body tracking capabilities. SBIRS constellation in action concept animation., Youtube Gif SBIRS has also been rumored that SBRIS may have a secondary capability that can detect other forms of infrared events, like artillery fire, and even the launches of surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. Some have even posited that aircraft may be traceable by the system as well under some circumstances. Regardless of existing capabilities, the Midcourse Tracking Sensor, and other space-based sensors like it, will be critical to creating the ability to counter-hypersonic weapons as the technology continues to mature into an operational state. According to Hyten, the technology is ready and somewhat affordable, and in comparison to what has been spent on ground-based radars, not to mention an armada of sea-going radars that support MDA missions, that still have exploitable weaknesses in coverage and capability, it really does make sense regardless of the sticker shock usually associated with space-based sensor constellations. The general’s remarks seem to be reflected, at least partially, in the 2019 budget, with the Missile Defense Agency making taking on hypersonic threats a new focus. From the budget summary: 2019 Budget Documents Here are the line-item documents for hypersonic defense from the MDA’s 2019 budget: 2019 budget docs 2019 budget docs 2019 budget docs 2019 budget docs 2019 budget docs There is no mention of the Midcourse Tracking Sensor in these documents per se, but that doesn’t mean it is not a program within the Missile Defense Agency’s classified budget, or part of one of these existing developmental line item concepts. Even if it doesn’t exist just yet, it seems like Hyten, other MDA stake holders, including members of congress and the White House, would support jump starting the program. The idea sounds like a good one that may even be essential even to hypersonic missile early warning in the future, yet alone ballistic missile defense, but putting such critical assets into orbit also is a reminder of how vulnerable America’s space-based platforms are at present. This is beginning to change though, with the USAF putting a whole new emphasis on creating far more resilient space-based capabilities. But still, with major peer state competitors hurtling themselves at anti-satellite weaponry that can jam, disable, blind, or destroy enemy orbital spacecraft, making sure such a sensor is survivable , or at least rapidly replaceable , would also be key. With all this in mind, two things seem certain at this point, the 2020 budget will likely have far greater emphasis put on space-based capabilities, and the great hypersonics race , which will be rife with measure and countermeasure, has officially begun.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Dec 27, 2017",Officials Admit Japan’s ‘Helicopter Destroyers’ Were Also Designed For Jets,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Japanese Ministry of Defense executives have outright admitted that despite the Japanese government’s past denials that the Izumo class “helicopter destroyers” were not designed to accommodate fixed-wing short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) tactical jets, they actually were designed with exactly that in mind. The Asahi Shimbun quoted Maritime Self Defense Force sources stating the following: “It is only reasonable to design (the Izumo ) with the prospect of possible changes of the circumstances in the decades ahead… We viewed that whether the Izumo should be actually refitted could be decided by the government.” USN When the Izumo first entered service, the vessels’ ominous profile and massive proportions led many, including the author , to allege that these vessels were intended to one day carry fixed-wing tactical jets. It also wasn’t really clear why the country would need larger vessels than the Hyuga class helicopter destroyers already in production if they weren’t going to gain more offensive capabilities. Although they have amphibious capabilities, Japan’s helicopter carriers are traditionally more focused on anti-submarine warfare. Asahi Shimbun’s sources went on to say that a consensus was privately reached among the service’s leadership that the Izumo class would be designed for conversion into a fixed-wing capable aircraft carrier in the future but the Japanese government would deny this due to the issues surrounding violating Article Nine of the Japanese constitution. AP We recently reported that Japan’s Self Defense Forces were looking at the idea of refitting its Izumo class carriers , of which there are two, to accommodate the F-35B, as well as larger plans to purchase more F-35s, including between 20 and 40 F-35B models. With this in mind, it seems pretty clear that this was the plan all along, or at least it was envisioned as a major possibility when the ships were being designed and constructed. But this new information also points to the possibility that making the Izumo class ships F-35B capable will be far less complicated and expensive than some may have thought. China’s naval expansion eastward in particular was a major concern among designers when the ship’s plans were being formulated in the mid 2000s. One official told Asahi Shimbun: “The plan to construct the Izumo was settled with its future conversion in mind to prepare for any possible contingency of the unavailability of the ASDF Naha Base.” Naha Base is co-located alongside Naha Airport on Okinawa, and is the only major air base controlled by Japan’s Air Self Defense Forces in the area, although the American bases of Kadena and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma are also on the island. Still, the runways at all three bases will be top targets for Chinese ballistic and cruise missiles during a time of war. AP The F-35B can operate from short prepared strips, making denying its ability to generate sorties far more challenging for potential foes. The aircraft could also provide high-end fighter operations from forward staging bases on more remote islands in Japan’s southern island chain. Putting the F-35B on a carrier makes it even more survivable and flexible during a conflict with a major peer state foe. It also allows for air power to persist even after land-based aviation capabilities has been effectively taken out of the fight, even if just temporarily. The ships could also setup a presence near the disputed Senkaku Islands and other tense locales. Hard-hitting power projection farther from Japan’s own territory is also a major possibility as well with an F-35B capable carrier. AP The article goes on to outline that the class’s hangar and elevators were built to dimensions that could accommodate the F-35B and the MV-22 Osprey—Japan already has MV-22s on order. Even the class’s flight deck can supposedly withstand the heat and pressure generated by the F-35’s scorching exhaust. The official also says the carriers’ deck would likely be modified with a ski-jump if the F-35B were acquired. The justification of Japan’s military posture, and the weaponry that supports it, all comes down to how one interprets “self defense” as per the Japanese constitution, but really, things have been rapidly changing for Japan when it comes to morphing its military into a far-reaching force with substantial offensive punch. Lockheed Seeing as all the other power players in the region are acquiring ever more advanced flattops , Japans move to modify the Izumo class to accommodate the F-35B is likely a foregone eventuality at this point, although exactly when a refit would occur remains unknown. Some reports state that the F-35Bs could be ordered as soon as next year, with them becoming operational by 2024. Presumably at least one modified Izumo class carrier would be ready to accommodate them by that time as well. Considering that Japan is looking to arm itself with long-range cruise missiles and more capable fighters in the near term, a fixed-wing capable Izumo and her sister ship Kaga won’t be far behind, ushering in a new era of power projection for Japan the likes of which the world has not seen since the end of World War II.

Tyler Rogoway,"Updated on Jun 30, 2019",Iraq Looking To Buy Russia’s S-400 Air Defense System: Report,"The TWZ Newsletter Email address Sign Up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Iraqi MP who heads the country’s security and defense committee, Hakim Al Zamili, has been quoted as making the case for Baghdad to pursue a modern integrated air defense and surface to air missile system—namely Russia’s much touted S-400 system . Al Zamili stated the following according to Russia’s TASS News Agency: “Iraq has the right to own cutting-edge weapons to defend its territory and air space from air attacks… Terrorism targets our country abundant in places sacred for every Iraqi. There are signs and warnings that extremists might use aircraft for attacks on those shrines, which cause lots of worries and anxiety in the country… America is a developed country, not less than any other. However, the World Trade Center was attacked by planes… So Iraq intends to possess such a system as S-400 to defend the land, shrines and air space. We are serious about that…. [The U.S.] is unwilling to equip Iraq with arms and to supply it with systems that will ensure comprehensive protection in its territory and air space…but wants Iraq to be an open arena for realization of [US] plans. That is why, Iraq needs to have own [anti-aircraft] systems, it is our right to obtain them.” An Iraqi delegation is heading to Moscow soon to discuss the purchase of S-400 batteries for the Iraqi military according to the report. The country already fields a number of Russian weapon systems that were acquired after the fall of dictator Saddam Hussein. These include Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-25 attack jets, Pantsir-S point air defense systems, T-90S tanks, among other systems. The war-weary country has moved increasingly away from American weapons purchases in recent years and Russia isn’t their only vendor. For instance, Iraq has also bought unmanned aircraft from China, L159 light attack jets from the Czech Republic, and T-50 fighter-trainers from South Korea . The country’s primary modern air defense asset is its fleet of 35 F-16IQs, although the aircraft have restrictions on their combat capabilities and weapons menu. Most notably, Iraq’s F-16s were delivered with AIM-7 Sparrow capability only, and without the ability to fire far more capable and longer-ranged AIM-120 AMRAAMs. https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fys5UGebdyk In the aftermath of the country’s dire fight to expel ISIS from its many of its major population centers, it was expected that Iraq would start to pay more attention to building-up its higher-end military capabilities. Long-range surface-to-air missile systems and the integrated networks of sensors and communications nodes that enable them are very hot items in the Middle East as of late. Saudi Arabia is building an air defense system of massive proportions . Israel leads in this department with its dense multi-layered anti-air capabilities . Other Arab gulf states are also building up their air defenses with high-end western systems, and Iran, who is inching ever closer to Baghdad, has taken delivery of an advanced variant of the S-300 air defense system from Russia. To the west, the Russian’s have deployed their own S-400 and S-300 batteries to their outposts in Syria. Yet the S-400 is something of a geopolitical outlier as it is being procured by two U.S. allies, one of which is a NATO member, alongside American systems. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia are executing such peculiar procurement program. When it comes to Turkey, who is a F-35 partner nation, their fielding of such an advanced Russian system does not sit well with the U.S ., but it is just one of many points of contention between the once far tighter allies. Qatar is also looking to buy the S-400, a country who is purchasing high-end weapons from virtually everyone (including F-15QAs from the U.S.) as of late in a play to beef up its defenses and to placate its foreign supporters . A S-400 transporter-launcher and a Pantsir-S1 point defense system. Iraq already has ordered the Pantsir for close-range air defense purposes., Sergei MalgavkoTASS via Getty Images Still, the fact that Iraq would move to acquire an advanced Russian air defense system over a western one is another sign of the country both executing its independence and moving away from the United States sphere of influence when it comes to national security issues. It also is indicative of the heavy influence Iran, a Russian ally, wields over large factions of the Iraqi Parliament. But the reality is that it’s uncertain if the U.S. would even allow Iraq to buy Patriot missile batteries , so the move toward Russia is likely also an effort to avoid that uncertainty altogether. Russia is likely to cut Iraq a good deal on the S-400 system as the Kremlin has a long-term strategy in the region, especially in the area spanning from Syria to Iran, of which Iraq is a critical part. Selling high-end arms at good prices to those you wish to assert some influence over in the future is an age old strategy that usually works remarkably well in the short-term, although it can have unintended consequences farther down the road. One thing is for certain, having S-400 batteries arrayed around Iraq would make American access to the airspace over and around the country far more problematic than it is today should the Iraq’s no longer view America’s presence in their skies as warranted or wanted. The S-400 can reach out hundreds of miles, making its presence in Iraq a major issue for the country’s neighbors as well.
